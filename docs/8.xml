<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> 摘要：<br><br>这些信息是积极的。文章介绍了Asymmetric加密对冲基金的CEO兼CIO Joe McCann在X上对Solana市值预测达到1万亿美元的大胆言论。McCann批评了以太坊存在的问题，认为其不适合零售市场，而Solana则为零售用户提供了更好的体验。他指出Solana对零售用户的吸引力，并强调了Solana与以太坊在市值上的巨大潜力差距，认为Solana有望取代以太坊。 Solana在零售交易和memecoin活动中的表现被视为其成功的迹象。Solana当前交易价格为201.27美元。 <div>
<p>Joe McCann, the CEO and CIO of the crypto hedge fund Asymmetric, recently made a bold <a href="https://twitter.com/joemccann/status/1769497076667404528" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">statement</a> on X (formerly Twitter), forecasting a $1 trillion market cap for Solana. McCann&#8217;s argument hinges on several key points that detail why he believes Solana has achieved product-market fit (PMF) as &#8220;The Chain for Retail,&#8221; juxtaposing it against Ethereum&#8217;s challenges and perceived shortcomings for retail users.</p>
<h2>Solana Beats Ethereum</h2>
<p>McCann critiques Ethereum for not being designed with retail in mind, pointing out its slow and expensive Layer 1 (L1) transactions, alongside the user experience (UX) nightmare posed by its numerous Layer 2 (L2) solutions. He states, &#8220;Ethereum is not a chain designed for retail &#8211; the L1 is too slow and expensive and the L2s are (currently) a UX nightmare.&#8221;</p>
<p>The friction for new users, fragmented liquidity across over “40 L2s”, and the complications with bridging are highlighted as significant barriers to Ethereum&#8217;s adoption by a broader retail audience.</p>

<p>Turning his attention to corporate-backed open-source projects like Coinbase&#8217;s L2 solution, Base, McCann acknowledges their potential to solve some <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-fees-plunge-70-following-a-yearly-high-in-may/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">UX issues</a>. However, he also notes the inherent priority of such projects to serve corporate interests, often at the expense of broader community needs.</p>
<p>Despite his critique, he admits, &#8220;Most corporate open source ultimately ends up serving corporate priorities&#8230;and it should!&#8221; This acknowledgment underscores the complexity of balancing corporate involvement in blockchain development with the ecosystem&#8217;s decentralized ethos.</p>
<p>McCann attributes Solana&#8217;s rise to its ability to serve the retail segment effectively, particularly through its association with memecoins and speculative trading. Describing Solana as originally being &#8220;Blockchain at Nasdaq speed&#8221; for its high throughput and low latency, he notes a pivotal shift in its narrative towards retail.</p>

<p>He observes, &#8220;Not once has the concept of being The Chain for Retail<img alt="™" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" style="height: 1em;" /> ever surfaced. Until now.&#8221; This shift is largely credited to Solana&#8217;s embrace by the memecoin community and the speculative trading that follows, marking a clear PMF with retail users.</p>
<p>Highlighting the explosion of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/why-shiba-inu-pepe-dogecoin-are-far-from-done/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">memecoin speculation</a> on Solana, especially post-NFL season, McCann points out, &#8220;Since the NFL season ended, speculation on memecoins has exploded&#8230;<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/sponsored/bonk-price-prediction-next-big-altcoin-set-to-explode/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">BONK</a> and WIF are on Solana. [&#8230;] Thousands of them are being created everyday and trading volumes are exploding.”</p>
<img alt="Meme coins go parabolic" class="wp-image-598412 size-full" height="766" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GI6BLhYaIAApe5v.jpg?resize=1314%2C766" width="1314" />
<p>The extensive creation and trading volumes of these coins on Solana are seen as a testament to its appeal and utility for retail speculators. Notably, the majority of memecoins is on Solana, not Ethereum.</p>
<p>”Trading Bots aka the ‘<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bonk-price-jumps-over-30-as-robinhood-revolut-listing-speculations-gain-traction/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Robinhood</a>-ification of crypto’ has been driving the majority of the trading due to its&#8230;great UX. [&#8230;] And the majority of those bots are trading memecoins on Solana. Solana is now consistently flipping Ethereum in DEX volumes yet for some reason, SOL is still 1/4th the value of Ethereum, it was 1/8th just a few days ago,” McCann noted.</p>
<img alt="Trading bots " class="wp-image-598411 size-full" height="830" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GI6B9VAbAAAJc57.jpg?resize=1488%2C830" width="1488" />
<p>He contrasts Solana&#8217;s market cap with Ethereum&#8217;s, using their relative valuations to argue for Solana&#8217;s growth potential. With Ethereum valued at just under $500 billion and Solana at about $115 billion, he suggests that Solana&#8217;s path to a $1 trillion market cap represents a nearly 10x growth opportunity, far outpacing the potential for Ethereum.</p>
<p>&#8220;ETH to $1T is a double. SOL to $1T is nearly a 10x. Which horse are you gonna bet on? The fastest one, obviously,&#8221; McCann concludes, encapsulating his bullish outlook for Solana based on its retail-friendly ecosystem and the vibrant activity around memecoins.</p>
<p>At press time, Solana traded at $201.27.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br><br>摘要：这些信息是积极的。Solana的价格在美元上涨，并突破了200美元的阻力。价格目前超过200美元和100简单移动平均线（4小时）。在SOL/USD货币对的4小时图表中形成了一条连接的多头趋势线，支撑位于195美元。如果价格突破205美元和212美元的阻力水平，可能会继续上涨。支持位于195美元和175美元附近，而阻力位于205美元、212美元和220美元附近。MACD持续向上，RSI高于50水平。整体而言，Solana的技术指标显示积极的态势。 <div>
<p><em>Solana is gaining bullish momentum above $200. SOL price is still showing positive signs, and it could even surpass the $220 resistance in the near term.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>SOL price gained bullish momentum and cleared the $200 resistance against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>The price is now trading above $200 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $195 on the 4-hour chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken).</li>
<li>The pair could continue to rally if it clears the $205 and $212 resistance levels.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Solana Price Extends Rally</h2>
<p>Solana price remained strong above the $150 level and extended its <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/sol-price-breaks-150/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">rally</a>. There was a decent increase above the $165 and $180 levels.</p>
<p>The price is up nearly 20% and there was a move above the $200 level, outperforming Bitcoin and <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-grinds-lower-3400/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ethereum</a>. A new multi-month high was formed near $204, and the price is now consolidating gains. It is stable above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $142 swing low to the $204 high.</p>
<p>There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $195 on the 4-hour chart of the SOL/USD pair. Solana is now trading above $200 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Solana_f3319d.png?resize=1024%2C461"><img alt="SOL Price" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-598388" height="461" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Solana_f3319d.png?resize=1024%2C461" width="1024" /></a></p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/SOLUSD/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SOLUSD on TradingView.com</a></p>
<p>Immediate resistance is near the $205 level. The next major resistance is near the $212 level. A successful close above the $212 resistance could set the pace for another major increase. The next key resistance is near $220. Any more gains might send the price toward the $232 level.</p>
<h2>Are Dips Supported in SOL?</h2>
<p>If SOL fails to rally above the $205 resistance, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $195 level and the trend line.</p>
<p>The first major support is near the $175 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $142 swing low to the $204 high, below which the price could test $165. If there is a close below the $165 support, the price could decline toward the $150 support or the 100 simple moving average (4 hours) in the near term.</p>
<p>Technical Indicators</p>
<p>4-Hours MACD – The MACD for SOL/USD is gaining pace in the bullish zone.</p>
<p>4-Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for SOL/USD is above the 50 level.</p>

<h2>Ethereum Price Dips</h2>
<p>Ethereum price started a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-takes-hit-3680/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">downside correction</a> below the $3,800 and $3,700 levels, like <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-slides-68k/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin</a>. ETH declined below the $3,650 support level to enter a short-term bearish zone.</p>
<p>It even spiked below the $3,500 support zone. A low was formed at $3,414 and the price is now attempting a recovery wave. There was a move above the $3,500 level. Ether climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $4,084 swing high to the $3,414 low.</p>
<p>Ethereum price is now trading below $3,700 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $3,650 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,660 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.</p>
<p>The first major resistance is near the $3,750 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $4,084 swing high to the $3,414 low. The next major resistance is near $3,830, above which the price might gain bullish momentum.</p>

<p>In the stated case, Ether could rally toward the $3,925 level. If there is a move above the $3,925 resistance, Ethereum could even rise toward the $4,000 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of $4,080.</p>
<h2>More Losses In ETH?</h2>

<title>Introducing Book Of Meme (BOME), The Latest $1 Billion Crypto Sensation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br><br>摘要：<br>这些信息是积极的。最近推出的Memecoin项目Book of Meme（BOME）在加密市场上表现出色，市值在48小时内达到10亿美元。BOME的创始人DarkFarms于本周宣布了这一项目，旨在将梗、去中心化存储解决方案、交易和赌博等内容融合在一个平台上，创造全新的Web3体验。BOME在Binance等重要加密平台上完成了上市，市值曾达到15.5亿美元。目前，BOME的价格为0.02139美元，24小时内涨幅达到58.08%，市值为11.8亿美元，居于第85位的加密货币。 <div>
<p>Memecoin project Book of Meme (BOME) has emerged as the latest shining star in the crypto market over the last few days. Following its official launch this week, BOME has attracted much investor interest, acquiring a market cap of $1 billion within 48 hours of trading.</p>
<p>BOME’s sudden emergence can be regarded as a silver lining in the crypto space in the last week amidst Bitcoin’s 4% decline, which resulted in the maiden cryptocurrency falling to around $65,345.14. Meanwhile, Ethereum is also down by 10%, while prominent memecoins <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-influencer-scams/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Dogecoin</a> and <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/behind-the-scenes-of-shiba-inu-12-plunge-what-on-chain-analysis-tells-us/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Shiba Inu</a> also recorded losses to the tune of 24.23% and 16.69% over the last seven days. </p>

<h2>What Is The Book Of Meme?</h2>
<p>The Book of Meme was founded by DarkFarms, the creator of another popular memecoin Pepecoin. BOME functions as an experimental project aimed at incorporating memes, decentralized storage solutions, degen shitcoin trading, and gambling on a single platform in a bid to create a novel web3 experience. </p>
<p>Following a successful presale that raised 10,131 SOL, BOME debuted in the crypto market on March 14 with an initial price of $0.0000496. Over the next two days, Book of Meme swiftly rose to a price region of $0.012 while achieving a market cap value of $1 billion. </p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Due to the sudden listing by Binance, MEMECOIN BOME rose sharply by 243% in 24h, but other MEMECOINs generally fell sharply, PEPE WIF FLOKI BONK fell by more than 10%. The current market value of BOME has exceeded US$1.38 billion, ranking seventh in MEMECOIN in terms of market…</p>
<p>— Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1769015001304781183?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">March 16, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Unsurprisingly, BOME&#8217;s expeditious rise has earned the coin listings on major crypto platforms, including KuCoin, Gate.io, MEXC, HTX, Crypto.com and Binance. In particular, BOME’s listing on Binance on March 16 is believed to have spurred the token to a 243% price gain within a day, allowing the memecoin to gain a peak market cap of $1.55 billion. </p>
<p>In a similar fashion with other highly successful memecoins, some investors have benefitted the most from BOME’s rise.<a href="https://x.com/WuBlockchain/status/1769031149643501757?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> Data from LookonChain</a> reveals that a certain investor already sold all 347 million BOME for 34,647 SOL valued at $6.58 million, recording a 340x gain on 102 ($19,000) investment at the presale. Meanwhile, the largest BOME holding personal address known as sundayfunday.sol currently holds 1.242 billion BOME, valued at $29.8 million. </p>

<h2>BOME Price Overview</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, Book of Meme currently trades at $0.02139 with a 58.08% gain on the last day. Meanwhile, the coin’s daily trading volume is up by 125.05% and is valued at $5.18 billion. BOME’s current market cap stands at $1.18 billion, allowing the memecoin to rank as the 85th largest cryptocurrency. </p>

<div> <br><br>摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章重点介绍了Shiba Inu作为一个追求1000亿市值的主要目标的情况。文章讨论了IntoTheBlock的数据显示的持币地址增长、机构投资者和大户活跃交易，以及大户持有量的集中。同时，文章提到了Jake Gagain的预测，认为Shiba Inu有可能超过狗狗币，实现1000亿市值。总之，Shiba Inu在追求这一里程碑的过程中面临挑战，但也展现出坚定和决心。 <div>
<p>Shiba Inu, the meme coin sensation, is making headlines once again. With its sights set on a major achievement &#8211; a staggering $100 billion market cap &#8211; Shiba Inu has captured the attention of the crypto community.</p>
<p>This audacious ambition has been fueled by data from IntoTheBlock, shedding light on the coin&#8217;s potential. Additionally, renowned investor Jake Gagain has made a bold prediction, further igniting excitement within the crypto community.</p>

<h2><strong>Shiba Inu: Growing Interest, Volatile Trading</strong></h2>
<p>According to analysis from IntoTheBlock, SHIB has witnessed a surge in the number of addresses holding the token. This surge indicates a growing interest and adoption of Shiba Inu among retail investors, who are eager to partake in the meme coin revolution.</p>
<p>Moreover, there has been a notable increase in the number of large transactions involving Shiba Inu tokens, suggesting institutional investors and whales are actively engaging with the coin.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-598265" height="216" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_b80e2e.png?resize=388%2C216" width="388" /></p>

<p><a href="https://app.intotheblock.com/register" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">IntoTheBlock&#8217;s data</a> reveals a concentration of wealth among the top holders of Shiba Inu. Approximately 50% of the total supply is held by the top 100 addresses, indicating the potential influence these large holders may have on the market dynamics and price movements of Shiba Inu. This concentration of wealth can play a significant role in shaping the future trajectory of the coin.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/0YSrdCdD/" width="1835" /></p>

<p>Trading activity surrounding the memecoin has also been a focal point of the analysis. The data highlights the volatility of Shiba Inu&#8217;s trading volume, with periods of intense fluctuations followed by relative stability. This volatility can be attributed to various factors, including market sentiment, news events, and overall market conditions.</p>
<h2><strong>SHIB $100 Billion Milestone</strong></h2>
<p>In the midst of this excitement, renowned investor Jake Gagain has made a bold prediction: He firmly believes that Shiba Inu has the potential to surpass Dogecoin and reach a remarkable $100 billion market cap. This prediction has sparked both enthusiasm and skepticism, as the rivalry between Shiba Inu and Dogecoin intensifies.</p>

<p>Taking all these factors into account, the journey towards the billion-dollar market cap for <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/shiba-inu-mania-price-surges-60-as-burn-rate-heats-up-by-over-22000/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Shiba Inu</a> is not without its challenges. While the recent surge in market cap and the accumulation by large holders are positive indicators, the volatility and concentration of wealth present potential risks that need to be navigated.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the resilience and determination exhibited by the memecoin, coupled with the growing interest from retail and institutional investors, provide a strong foundation for its pursuit of the $100 billion milestone.</p>
<p>Shiba Inu&#8217;s quest for a $100 billion market cap represents a paradigm shift in the world of meme coins. Backed by data from IntoTheBlock, which highlights growing adoption, concentration of wealth, and trading activity, as well as the bold prediction from Jake Gagain, SHIB has positioned itself as a formidable contender in the cryptoverse.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br><br>摘要：这些信息是消极的。MATIC价格在过去一周内下跌超过10％，24小时内下跌8％，受到整个加密货币市场负面情绪的影响。最新的链上分析显示关键支撑水平在当前价格点附近。超过10,900个地址在$1.02和$1.05之间购买了6.08亿个Polygon。如果支撑力量减弱，价格可能跌至$0.91。此外，$0.89和$0.92价格范围也是一个重要支撑区域，拥有将近4亿个Polygon。MATIC目前价格为$1.04，过去7天下跌9.7％。市值超过97亿美元，排名第18。 <div>
<p><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/polygon/polygon-matic-whale-deposit-binance-bearish/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">MATIC, the native token of the Polygon network</a>, has witnessed a significant decline in its value. It has fallen by more than 10% in the past week and 8% in less than 24 hours as the general cryptocurrency market continues to grapple with a cloud of negative sentiment.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the latest on-chain analysis has revealed the important levels that investors should look out for following the latest decline in the MATIC price.</p>
<h2>Over 10,900 Addresses Bought 600 Million Polygon Tokens At This Price</h2>
<p>According to a recent <a href="https://x.com/ali_charts/status/1769135468208119809?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post on X</a> by crypto pundit Ali Martinez, the price of MATIC has established a key support around its current price point. This evaluation is based on analytics firm IntoTheBlock’s on-chain data, which tracks the average acquisition price for any given wallet address.</p>
<p><img alt="MATIC" class="aligncenter wp-image-598220 size-large" height="292" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GI06oELX0AA8aSo-1.jpeg?w=860&#038;resize=860%2C292" width="860" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Above is the chart highlighted by <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-long-positions-surge-on-bitfinex-whales-add-4230-btc-signaling-potential-price-reversal/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Martinez</a> that shows the distribution of the Polygon token supply across various price ranges. The size of the dots in the chart represents the magnitude of coins purchased around the corresponding price range.</p>

<p>Most notably, over 10,900 wallet addresses bought a whopping 608 million MATIC around the $1.02 and $1.05 zone. According to the crypto analyst, this massive buying activity has supported the establishment of crucial support around this price region.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Polygon?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">#Polygon</a> has found crucial support between $1.02 and $1.05, supported by 10,900 addresses holding around 608 million <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MATIC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">#MATIC</a>. Should this support falter, the next essential demand zone lies near $0.91, where 35,700 addresses collectively hold 394.6 million <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MATIC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">$MATIC</a>. <a href="https://t.co/rLn4ymcQf7" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/rLn4ymcQf7</a></p>

<p>While the large size of the dot reflects the strength of this particular level, sustained bearish pressure could cause the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/altcoins-watchlist-market-expert-spotlights-eth-blur-matic-and-more-for-explosive-gains/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">price of MATIC to breach</a> and fall beneath this support. In this case, investors could see the cryptocurrency drop to around $0.91.</p>
<p>This makes the $0.89 and $0.92 price range another level to watch, as it represents the next vital support area, where 35,680 wallet addresses purchased nearly 400 million Polygon tokens.</p>
<h2>MATIC Price Overview</h2>
<p>As of this writing, the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/matic/polygon-vesting-matic-price-3/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">price of MATIC</a> stands at $1.04, reflecting an 8% decline in the past 24 hours. This price dip comes after the altcoin printed a multi-month high of $1.28 on Thursday, March 14.</p>
<p>According to data from CoinGecko, the Polygon coin has suffered a 9.7% price slump in the last seven days. From a broader perspective, though, the cryptocurrency has had a fairly positive performance in the past month.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">With a market capitalization of more than $9.7 billion, the MATIC token ranks as the 18th-largest cryptocurrency in the sector.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br><br>摘要：<br>这些信息是消极的。比特币价格急剧下跌至每周最低的65,000美元，引发投资者的重大损失。除了比特币，以太坊和币安币也下跌了10%以上，同时，狗狗币和狗熊币更是暴跌20%和近30%。市场分析师发出警钟，警告比特币可能进一步下跌至63,000美元，市场的不确定性和风险加剧。在过去24小时里，超过151,000个交易者面临强制平仓，市场动态重新调整，投资者需要谨慎应对。 <div>
<p>In a tumultuous turn of events, the cryptocurrency market has been rattled by a sharp decline in Bitcoin prices. After a sustained period of remarkable gains and record highs, Bitcoin has plunged to a weekly low of $65,000, marking a significant setback for investors.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bitcoin numbers were all painted in red,</a> and trading at $65,710, losing value in the 24-hour and weekly timeframes by 5.6% and 4.5%, respectively, according to data from Coingecko.</p>
<p>A few days after its previous low of $68,000, Bitcoin plummeted to its present level, a figure not seen in a week, as bears persisted in their downward pressure.</p>



<h2><strong>Altcoins Also Take A Beating</strong></h2>
<p>While Bitcoin bears the brunt of the downturn, altcoins are not spared from the fallout. Ethereum (ETH) and Binance Coin (BNB) have also witnessed<a href="https://coinank.com/liqMapChart" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> substantial losses</a>, shedding 10% of their value or more.</p>
<p>Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, two popular meme coins, have experienced even steeper declines, plunging by 20% and nearly 30%, respectively. The broader altcoin market mirrors Bitcoin&#8217;s downward trajectory, amplifying the sense of unease among investors.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/ISYm1HEA/" width="2475" /></p>

<strong>Bitcoin: Impact On Market Dynamics</strong>
<p>The recent price correction in Bitcoin has reverberated across the cryptocurrency landscape, reshaping market dynamics and investor sentiment. <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">The surge in liquidations</a>, with over 151,000 traders facing margin calls in the past 24 hours, underscores the magnitude of the market upheaval. Bitcoin&#8217;s dominance in the market is evident as it accounts for the lion&#8217;s share of the total liquidations, highlighting its pivotal role in shaping overall market trends.</p>
<p>As a result of the decline in value, the total market liquidations have reached $426 million, with Bitcoin taking the worst hit.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-598210" height="384" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_562718.png?resize=724%2C384" width="724" /></p>
<strong>Liquidation Spree</strong>
<p>The amount that the price of Bitcoin has liquidated over the last 24 hours has exceeded $104 million, with long traders losing the most money—they lost $86 million compared to $18 million for short sellers. Ethereum saw a $48 million overall liquidation, with $33 million going to long traders and $15 million going to short traders, as a result of the losing run.</p>
<strong>Analyst Sounds Alarm Siren</strong>
<p>Meanwhile, market analysts such as Markus Thielen, CEO of 10x Research, have sounded the alarm bells, warning of further downside risks for Bitcoin. Thielen&#8217;s prediction of a potential drop to $63,000 sends a sobering message to investors, urging caution and prudence in navigating the current market environment.</p>
<p>His insights shed light on underlying concerns about Bitcoin&#8217;s market structure, including low trading volumes and liquidity, which exacerbate the risk of sharp price corrections.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-598209" height="340" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_34d7be.png?resize=588%2C340" width="588" /></p>
<p>Amidst the market turbulence, investors are grappling with the implications of Thielen&#8217;s analysis and adjusting their strategies accordingly. The era of meme coin mania appears to be waning, prompting investors to reassess their positions and secure profits while they still can.</p>

<title>Grayscale Submits Revised Application For Ethereum Spot ETF – What’s New?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br><br>摘要：这些信息是消极的。<br><br>据称Grayscale已向美国证券交易委员会(SEC)更新了申请，以获得以太坊现货交易所交易基金(ETF)。该公司正努力在纽约证券交易所(NYSE) Arca上市和交易其以太坊信托基金的股份。虽然其他企业也提交了类似的ETF申请，但美国参议员要求SEC主席限制未来的加密货币ETF申请。他们认为，对涉及交易量较小的加密货币或易受操纵的加密货币的ETF存在巨大风险，SEC不应批准这些产品。以太坊代币目前价格为$3,731，过去一天上涨了1.2%。 <div>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-spot-etf-grayscale-outflows/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Asset management firm Grayscale</a> Investments has updated its application for an Ethereum spot ETF (exchange-traded fund) with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<h2 class="p1"><strong>Ethereum Spot ETF Case Just As Solid As Bitcoin’s, Grayscale Argues</strong></h2>
<p class="p1">According to a recent post on X by Craig Salm, Grayscale’s chief legal officer, the asset management firm has <a href="https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/nyse/markets/nyse-arca/rule-filings/filings/2024/SR-NYSEArca-2023-70_Am._1.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">revised its 19b-4 form</a> for an Ether spot ETF. Salm claimed that this move was “important” in an effort for Grayscale to list and trade shares of its Ether Trust on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Arca.</p>
<p class="p1">The chief legal officer <a href="https://x.com/CraigSalm/status/1768750794021511218?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">stated in his post</a> that investors “want and deserve access” to Ethereum via a spot exchange-traded product, likening the situation to the Bitcoin ETF story. “We believe the case is just as strong as it was for spot Bitcoin ETFs,” Salm said.</p>

<p class="p1">The asset manager is amongst the numerous firms <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/approval-denial-ethereum-etf-sell-the-news-event/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">looking to issue the first Ethereum spot ETF</a> in the United States, having filed an application with the SEC on October 10, 2023. However, these ETF applications have faced delays multiple times, with the most recent coming against BlackRock’s filing on March 4, 2024.</p>
<p class="p1">As a result, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-etfs-approval-odds-drop-to-35/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the likelihood</a> of the SEC approving an Ethereum spot ETF has taken a nosedive in recent weeks. Once-optimistic Bloomberg ETF expert Balchunas even revealed in his latest analysis that the ETH funds now have only a 35% chance of approval.</p>












<h2><strong>SEC Chairman Faces Pressure Over Crypto Approval</strong></h2>













<p class="p1">Two US senators of the Democrat party, Sens. Laphonza Butler of California and Jack Reed of Rhode Island, have urged the SEC chairman to avoid approving crypto investment products. In a letter dated March 11, the lawmakers, who are also members of the Senate Banking Committee, asked the Commission to limit future crypto ETF applications.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The success of the BTC spot products clearly ruffling some feathers on the Hill. <a href="https://twitter.com/SenatorJackReed?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">@SenatorJackReed</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Senlaphonza?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">@Senlaphonza</a> write to the <a href="https://twitter.com/SECGov?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">@SECGov</a> urging:-no further ETPs for other tokens-make life difficult (i.e. examinations/reviews) for brokers and advisers that recommend BTC ETPs <a href="https://t.co/enxdumC02N" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/enxdumC02N</a></p>

<p></p>
<p class="p1">Following the approval of 11 Bitcoin spot ETFs in January, the attention of the crypto public has somewhat turned to whether the SEC will do the same for the Ethereum versions. However, this latest letter from the senate seems to further <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-etfs-approval-outlook-fades-ahead-may-23/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">hurt the chances of an ETH ETF approval</a>.</p>

<p class="p1">A part of the letter read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">Retail investors would face enormous risks from ETPs referencing thinly traded cryptocurrencies or cryptocurrencies whose prices are especially susceptible to pump-and-dump or other fraudulent schemes,&#8221; they said. &#8220;The Commission is under no obligation to approve such products, and given the risk, it should not do so.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">As of this writing, the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-takes-hit-3680/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">price of the Ethereum</a> token stands at $3,731, reflecting a 1.2% increase in the past day.</p>

<title>XRP Records Massive 80% Surge In Trading Volume – Can Price Reach A New ATH?</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/all/xrp-records-massive-80-surge-in-trading-volume-can-price-reach-a-new-ath/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/all/xrp-records-massive-80-surge-in-trading-volume-can-price-reach-a-new-ath/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br><br>摘要：<br>这些信息是积极的。文章首先指出XRP在市场中表现不佳，但近期交易量呈现出激增趋势。尽管交易量激增，价格仍在13%的回调中。然而，近期80%的交易量增长引发了价格上涨的预期。XRP突破了长达6年的对称三角形，引发了分析师对价格持续上涨的预期。尽管价格在短期内有所下跌，但预测显示XRP价格可能会从当前水平上涨到$3。目前XRP的价格为$0.6398，挑战创下的历史最高价。行情分析和预测显示，XRP可能会在不久的将来经历巨大涨幅，关键阻力位在$0.74。机构投资者对XRP的非证券地位表示信心，这可能推动价格上涨。欧洲公司治理研究所最近发表的一份报告确认了XRP的非证券地位。 <div>
<p>XRP continues to <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-break-bull-pattern/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">show strength</a> despite largely underperforming during the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/breaking-news-ticker/breaking-bitcoin-hits-new-all-time-high-surging-past-70000-for-the-first-time-in-history/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">ongoing bull market</a>. Interestingly, the crypto witnessed a surge in activity last week, with trading volume surging in tandem. Particularly, the trading volume saw an increase of over 80% recently. </p>
<p>However, the boost in activity and trading volume has not necessarily translated into continuous price growth, as XRP is currently on a 13% percent correction from the $0.74 price level on Monday.</p>

<h2><b>XRP Trading Volume Surges, But Will Price Follow?</b></h2>
<p>XRP witnessed a surge earlier in the week which saw it breaking out of a 6-year-long symmetrical triangle, prompting analysts to anticipate a continued price surge. </p>
<p>During this period, the crypto witnessed a surge in trading volume from whales in particular, with large bouts of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/94-million-xrp-exits-binance/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">XRP leaving crypto exchanges</a>.</p>
<p>This bullish sentiment allowed XRP to cross over $0.74 for the first time in eight months, albeit for a short moment. This surge in price was short-lived, as XRP fell as low as $0.6 in the days after.</p>
<p>However, a recent 80% surge in on-chain activity and trading volume has led to the price of XRP increasing by 4.45% in the past 24 hours and 2.2% in a seven-day timeframe. </p>
<p>Volume spikes of this magnitude often occur before a price rally, therefore, this massive spike in volume has the XRP community speculating that a strong price rally could be on the horizon.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/7pDB2vOg/" width="1835" /></p>

<h2><b>Current Price Action: Can XRP Reach A New All-Time High?</b></h2>
<p>At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.6398. The crypto&#8217;s journey to a new all-time high is definitely <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/xrp-on-the-brink-bullish-pattern-or-profit-taking-retreat/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">not going to be an easy one</a>, as it is now down by 83% from its current all-time high of $3.84. </p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-rocket-2300-to-14-6/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">current market dynamics</a> and various <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-to-skyrockets-to-1-33-amidst-april-rally-analysts/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">predictions from many crypto analysts</a> indicate that the crypto might go on a surge of great magnitude in the near future. </p>
<p>One of these is a prediction from <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/symmetrical-30000-xrp-price/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">analyst Jaydee</a>, who <a href="https://x.com/jaydee_757/status/1751468373756858664?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">noted </a>that XRP&#8217;s recent breakout from the six-year trendline mentioned earlier could lead to a surge to $3 from the current price level.</p>
<p>The major resistance level to watch is $0.74. XRP tested this level a few days ago but failed to close above it. If bullish momentum continues and volume stays strong, XRP could break through $0.74 decisively in the new week. If it does, the next resistance <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-prediction-rally-0-85/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">levels are at $0.82</a> and $1.5. </p>

<p>One of the few factors that could contribute to a strong price increase is <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-scores-win-endorsed-as-non-security-status/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">regulatory clarity</a> regarding XRP&#8217;s status, which could boost confidence from institutional investors. </p>
<p>Notably, XRP&#8217;s non-security status seems <a href="https://t.co/uJ0bDpKfJE" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">to be gaining ground</a>. The European Corporate Governance Institute (ECGI) recently published a <a href="https://www.ecgi.global/sites/default/files/working_papers/documents/corporategovernancemeetsdataandtechnology.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">research paper</a> acknowledging this non-security status.</p>
