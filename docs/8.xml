<br><br>摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br>最近比特币恐惧与贪婪指数显示情绪有所降温，为可能的反弹铺平了道路。指数考虑波动性、交易量、社交媒体情绪、市值主导和谷歌趋势。当前，投资者持有极度贪婪的心态，但指数现在为77，显示情绪有所减缓。先前最高点与极端贪婪情绪重合，而最低点通常发生在市场处于极度恐惧区域时。比特币价格周末暴跌至64,500美元，但在过去一天中已经有所恢复，目前回升至68,000美元。 <div>
<p>The Bitcoin Fear &amp; Greed Index shows that the sentiment around the asset has cooled off a bit recently, something that could pave the way for a rebound.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Fear &amp; Greed Index Has Gone Through Some Decline Recently</h2>
<p>The &#8220;<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/crypto-fear-greed-index-drops-to-one-month-low-heres-what-it-means/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Fear &amp; Greed Index</a>&#8221; is an indicator created by <a href="https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Alternative</a> that tells us about the average sentiment present among the investors in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency market</p>
<p>To determine the trader mentality, the index takes into consideration for these five factors: volatility, trading volume, social media sentiment, market cap dominance, and Google Trends.</p>

<p>The metric uses a numeric scale that runs from zero to hundred for representing this sentiment. A score of 46 or less implies the presence of fear among the investors, while that of 54 and above suggests greed in the market.</p>
<p>The territory between these two (47 to 53) naturally corresponds to the neutral mentality. Besides these three sentiments, there are also two extreme sentiments called &#8220;extreme greed&#8221; and &#8220;extreme fear.&#8221;</p>
<p>The extreme greed occurs at values above 75, while the extreme fear takes place below 25. Historically, these two sentiments have been quite relevant for BTC&#8217;s trajectory.</p>
<p>Tops have generally tended to form when the investors have held the former sentiment, while bottoms have been probable to happen when the market has been in the latter region.</p>
<p>At present, the traders are holding a mentality of extreme greed, as the latest data of the Bitcoin Fear &amp; Greed Index shows.</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Fear &amp; Greed Index" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-598440 aligncenter" height="329" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/meter_b48137.png?w=368&#038;resize=368%2C329" width="368" /></p>

<p>As is visible, the indicator&#8217;s value is 77 right now, meaning that while it&#8217;s indeed inside extreme greed, it&#8217;s only so just. This is a fresh change from how it has been recently, as the chart below displays.</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Extreme Greed" class="alignnone wp-image-598444 size-large aligncenter" height="406" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/chart_be381d.png?w=860&#038;resize=860%2C406" width="860" /></p>

<p>From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that the Bitcoin Fear &amp; Greed Index has mostly stayed deep inside the extreme greed region recently. On the 14th of this month, the indicator hit the 88 mark, and alongside this high, the BTC price registered its current all-time high of about $73,800.</p>
<p>Since this peak, though, the asset has <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-threatens-to-retreat-to-60000-as-bulls-seek-solid-ground/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">plunged</a>, and it appears that alongside it, so has the sentiment among the traders. As mentioned earlier, tops have been more likely to occur when the market has shared a mentality of extreme greed and this probability has generally only gone up the more extreme levels the metric has hit.</p>
<p>This could perhaps explain why the recent top occurred when it did. Another top this month, the one that took place on the 5th, also coincided with high values in the Fear &amp; Greed Index (a peak of 90 this time).</p>

<p>Shortly after this earlier peak and the plummet in the cryptocurrency that had followed, the asset found its bottom as the metric briefly exited the extreme greed region.</p>
<p>As the Bitcoin Fear &amp; Greed Index is once again looking to dip outside this territory, it&#8217;s possible that a bottom may be near for the price this time as well. It now remains to be seen if the sentiment would cool down enough in the coming days so as to leave the extreme region behind, at least temporarily.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>Bitcoin had plunged towards $64,500 during the weekend, but it seems the coin has made some recovery in the past day as it&#8217;s now back at $68,000.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Approaches Risky Territory As Halving Event Draws Near</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。文章讨论了比特币价格下跌的趋势，并预测在即将到来的分叉事件之前可能会进一步下降。专家指出在历史上，比特币在距离分叉事件前14-28天经常出现大幅回撤。此外，文章还介绍了比特币分叉的4个不同阶段，包括分叉前的上涨、最终分叉前的回撤、重新积累和抛物线上涨。文章强调了在暴涨之前通常会有一个多月的重新积累阶段。 <div>
<p>The <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-hits-support-65k/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">price of Bitcoin</a> has been on a downward trend since it reached a new all-time of $73,000, ushering in a wave of speculations regarding the crypto asset&#8217;s next direction in the short term.</p>
<p>In the past few days, Bitcoin&#8217;s recent dip has triggered a general crypto market retracement. With the Bitcoin Halving event fast approaching, many crypto analysts are anticipating a further decline in BTC&#8217;s price in the near future.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Poised For &#8220;Danger Zone&#8221; Ahead Of Halving Event</h2>
<p>Popular cryptocurrency trader and analyst Rekt Capital has <a href="https://x.com/rektcapital/status/1769465412322766993?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">shared</a> a gloomy prediction for Bitcoin with the crypto community on the social media platform X. His forecast examines BTC&#8217;s potential to drop even further prior to the halving event while noting the entrance to a risky area he dubbed the &#8220;Danger Zone.&#8221;</p>

<p>The analyst&#8217;s forecast came in light of BTC experiencing a notable decline in the past few days. According to the expert, two days from now, Bitcoin will formally venture into the danger Zone (orange). </p>
<p>This is the starting area of past retracements seen ahead of the BTC Halving, which is expected to take place in April. Prior to the halving, these retracements have constantly indicated intervals of substantial market corrections for the digital asset. </p>
<img alt="Bitcoin" class="size-medium wp-image-598467" height="325" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rekt-Capital-Bitcoin-Chart-1.jpg?w=460&#038;resize=460%2C325" width="460" />
<p>Rekt Capital further pointed out that the pre-halving retracements have historically been observed in BTC 14-28 days before the event. Bitcoin&#8217;s price witnessed a pullback of about 40% in advance of the 2016 halving occurrence. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, in 2020, the crypto asset fell by over 40% before the occasion. Presently, we are less than 30 days before this year&#8217;s <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/grayscale-next-bitcoin-halving-different/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">BTC halving</a> takes place; however, the price of the coin has declined by over 11% in the past week, suggesting further correction in the coming weeks. </p>
<p>The post read:</p>
<blockquote><p>In 2 days, Bitcoin will officially enter the &#8220;Danger Zone&#8221; (orange) where historical Pre-Halving Retraces have begun. Historically, Bitcoin has performed Pre-Halving Retraces 14-28 days before the Halving. In 2020, this retrace was -20% deep, and in 2016, this retrace was -40% deep. Currently, BTC is 30 days away from the Halving and has pulled back -11% this week.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is noteworthy that the crypto analyst had previously <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/historical-trends-unveil-bitcoin-peak-timing-in-current-bull-cycle/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">pinpointed</a> the timeframe BTC is expected to top out in this bull cycle. Rekt Capital believes the asset will peak within 280-350 days. Specifically, this could occur around mid-December this year, or in mid-February of next year.</p>
<h2>4 Distinct Halving Phases</h2>
<p>So far, the crypto analyst has <a href="https://x.com/rektcapital/status/1769656725341163692?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">highlighted</a> several different phases for the upcoming Bitcoin Halving; these include the Pre-Halving Rally, Final Pre-Halving Retrace, Re-accumulation, and Parabolic uptrend.</p>

<p>According to Rekt Capital, there usually is a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/whats-ahead-for-bitcoin-expert-forecasts-pre-halving-rally-as-early-as-next-week/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">pre-halving rally</a> approximately 60 days before the event takes place. For the final pre-halving retrace, it usually develops around 14 to 28 days ahead.</p>
<p>Furthermore, after the Pre-Halving pullback, a multi-month re-accumulation period follows. Lastly, the parabolic uptrend begins once Bitcoin exits the area of re-accumulation.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。比特币价格在创纪录高点后出现剧烈价格回调，导致投资者担忧可能出现更多熊市迹象。分析人士指出，投资者情绪受到影响，地址活跃度下降，市场存在卖压。然而，一些技术分析显示60,000至67,000美元之间可能是买家的支撑区域。尽管眼下形势不明朗，一些分析师看好比特币的长期前景，认为当前回调是牛市的正常和健康部分。机构资本的可能回归也被认为是潜在的反弹催化剂。 <div>
<p>After a spectacular ascent to record highs, Bitcoin (BTC) is facing a reality check. The past week has seen a dramatic price correction, leaving investors wondering if this is a temporary setback or a sign of a more bearish future.</p>
<p>The world&#8217;s most popular cryptocurrency reached an<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> intraday low of $64,620</a> on March 17th, a significant drop from its recent peak above $73,000. This pullback has triggered a wave of pessimism, with analysts pointing to declining profitability and a drop in daily active addresses on the network.</p>

<h2><strong>A Bearish Shadow Looms</strong></h2>
<p>According to analysts, investor sentiment has been hurt by a series of descending peaks and failed upturns, while selling pressure remains rampant as we approach the &#8220;weekly candle close.&#8221; This sentiment is echoed by data from IntoTheBlock, which shows a sharp decline in the number of addresses &#8220;In the Money,&#8221; signifying a decrease in overall profitability within the Bitcoin network.</p>

<h2><strong>Finding Support: A Beacon of Hope?</strong></h2>
<p>However, not everyone is hitting the panic button. Technical analysis suggests a potential support zone for buyers between $60,000 and $67,000. Popular trader Skew highlights this area as a possible turning point, while also acknowledging significant spot selling from major exchanges like Coinbase and Binance.</p>

<strong>Bulls On The Horizon: Are The Giants Awakening?</strong>
<p>While the immediate future appears uncertain, some analysts remain bullish on Bitcoin&#8217;s long-term prospects. They view the current correction as a natural and healthy part of any bull run, pointing to historical data where similar pullbacks paved the way for further growth.</p>
<p>Related Reading: <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-crashes-dip-to-65000-triggers-over-400-million-liquidation-avalanche/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin Crashes: Dip To $65,000 Triggers Over $400 Million Liquidation Avalanche</a></p>
<p>Adding fuel to the fire of optimism is the potential return of institutional capital. The recent resumption of buying from US Bitcoin ETFs and the prospect of a significant influx of funds from hedge funds and investment advisors in the coming months are seen as potential catalysts for a rebound.</p>


<p>Thomas Fahrer, CEO of Apollo, a decentralized online cryptocurrency platform renowned for its comprehensive crypto reviews and analysis of ETF inflows, echoes sentiments regarding X.</p>
<p>Fahrer characterizes the current state as a &#8220;Bear Trap&#8221; and pinpoints the resumption of buying from US Bitcoin ETFs on March 18 as a potential catalyst for an upward surge in X&#8217;s value.</p>

<p>Emphasizing the significance of increased institutional acceptance, Fahrer anticipates a surge in liquidity within Bitcoin ETFs, suggesting that substantial capital inflows from institutional investors have yet to materialize.</p>
<strong>The Verdict: Brace For A Volatile Week</strong>
<p>This week will be crucial for Bitcoin. The coming days will be a test of the cryptocurrency&#8217;s resilience and its ability to overcome the current selling pressure. If bulls can regain control and positive sentiment prevails, a return to record highs remains a possibility. However, if the downtrend continues, Bitcoin could face a more extended period of correction.</p>

<title>Solana Market Cap Set To Skyrocket 1,000%, Says Crypto Fund CEO</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-market-cap-1000-crypto-fund-ceo/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-market-cap-1000-crypto-fund-ceo/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章指出了Asymmetric的CEO兼CIO Joe McCann对Solana市值达到1万亿美元的乐观预测。McCann认为Solana胜过以太坊，因为以太坊的L1交易慢且昂贵，L2解决方案复杂，不适合零售用户。他认为Solana成功吸引了零售用户，尤其是通过与memecoin和投机交易的联合。Solana上的memecoin数量和交易量大幅增加，成为其吸引力和实用性的证明。McCann还比较了以太坊和Solana的市值，并认为Solana有潜力实现近10倍增长。Solana目前的交易价格为201.27美元。 <div>
<p>Joe McCann, the CEO and CIO of the crypto hedge fund Asymmetric, recently made a bold <a href="https://twitter.com/joemccann/status/1769497076667404528" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">statement</a> on X (formerly Twitter), forecasting a $1 trillion market cap for Solana. McCann&#8217;s argument hinges on several key points that detail why he believes Solana has achieved product-market fit (PMF) as &#8220;The Chain for Retail,&#8221; juxtaposing it against Ethereum&#8217;s challenges and perceived shortcomings for retail users.</p>
<h2>Solana Beats Ethereum</h2>
<p>McCann critiques Ethereum for not being designed with retail in mind, pointing out its slow and expensive Layer 1 (L1) transactions, alongside the user experience (UX) nightmare posed by its numerous Layer 2 (L2) solutions. He states, &#8220;Ethereum is not a chain designed for retail &#8211; the L1 is too slow and expensive and the L2s are (currently) a UX nightmare.&#8221;</p>
<p>The friction for new users, fragmented liquidity across over “40 L2s”, and the complications with bridging are highlighted as significant barriers to Ethereum&#8217;s adoption by a broader retail audience.</p>

<p>Turning his attention to corporate-backed open-source projects like Coinbase&#8217;s L2 solution, Base, McCann acknowledges their potential to solve some <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-fees-plunge-70-following-a-yearly-high-in-may/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">UX issues</a>. However, he also notes the inherent priority of such projects to serve corporate interests, often at the expense of broader community needs.</p>
<p>Despite his critique, he admits, &#8220;Most corporate open source ultimately ends up serving corporate priorities&#8230;and it should!&#8221; This acknowledgment underscores the complexity of balancing corporate involvement in blockchain development with the ecosystem&#8217;s decentralized ethos.</p>
<p>McCann attributes Solana&#8217;s rise to its ability to serve the retail segment effectively, particularly through its association with memecoins and speculative trading. Describing Solana as originally being &#8220;Blockchain at Nasdaq speed&#8221; for its high throughput and low latency, he notes a pivotal shift in its narrative towards retail.</p>

<p>He observes, &#8220;Not once has the concept of being The Chain for Retail<img alt="™" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" style="height: 1em;" /> ever surfaced. Until now.&#8221; This shift is largely credited to Solana&#8217;s embrace by the memecoin community and the speculative trading that follows, marking a clear PMF with retail users.</p>
<p>Highlighting the explosion of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/why-shiba-inu-pepe-dogecoin-are-far-from-done/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">memecoin speculation</a> on Solana, especially post-NFL season, McCann points out, &#8220;Since the NFL season ended, speculation on memecoins has exploded&#8230;<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/sponsored/bonk-price-prediction-next-big-altcoin-set-to-explode/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">BONK</a> and WIF are on Solana. [&#8230;] Thousands of them are being created everyday and trading volumes are exploding.”</p>
<img alt="Meme coins go parabolic" class="wp-image-598412 size-full" height="766" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GI6BLhYaIAApe5v.jpg?resize=1314%2C766" width="1314" />
<p>The extensive creation and trading volumes of these coins on Solana are seen as a testament to its appeal and utility for retail speculators. Notably, the majority of memecoins is on Solana, not Ethereum.</p>
<p>”Trading Bots aka the ‘<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bonk-price-jumps-over-30-as-robinhood-revolut-listing-speculations-gain-traction/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Robinhood</a>-ification of crypto’ has been driving the majority of the trading due to its&#8230;great UX. [&#8230;] And the majority of those bots are trading memecoins on Solana. Solana is now consistently flipping Ethereum in DEX volumes yet for some reason, SOL is still 1/4th the value of Ethereum, it was 1/8th just a few days ago,” McCann noted.</p>
<img alt="Trading bots " class="wp-image-598411 size-full" height="830" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GI6B9VAbAAAJc57.jpg?resize=1488%2C830" width="1488" />
<p>He contrasts Solana&#8217;s market cap with Ethereum&#8217;s, using their relative valuations to argue for Solana&#8217;s growth potential. With Ethereum valued at just under $500 billion and Solana at about $115 billion, he suggests that Solana&#8217;s path to a $1 trillion market cap represents a nearly 10x growth opportunity, far outpacing the potential for Ethereum.</p>
<p>&#8220;ETH to $1T is a double. SOL to $1T is nearly a 10x. Which horse are you gonna bet on? The fastest one, obviously,&#8221; McCann concludes, encapsulating his bullish outlook for Solana based on its retail-friendly ecosystem and the vibrant activity around memecoins.</p>
<p>At press time, Solana traded at $201.27.</p>
<img alt="Solana price " class="wp-image-598413 size-full" height="1673" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SOLUSD_2024-03-18_08-13-58.png?resize=3628%2C1673" width="3628" />

<title>SOL Price Crosses $200 Milestone, What’s Next For Solana?</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/sol-price-crosses-200/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/sol-price-crosses-200/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。Solana价格超过了$200关键阻力位，并显示出继续上涨的迹象。随着价格上涨，下一个重要的阻力位将是$205和$212。如果成功突破$212，可能会进一步上涨至$220水平。支撑位在$195和$175附近，以及在$165和$150水平。技术指标显示MACD朝着多头方向走高，RSI也位于50水平以上。 <div>
<p><em>Solana is gaining bullish momentum above $200. SOL price is still showing positive signs, and it could even surpass the $220 resistance in the near term.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>SOL price gained bullish momentum and cleared the $200 resistance against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>The price is now trading above $200 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $195 on the 4-hour chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken).</li>
<li>The pair could continue to rally if it clears the $205 and $212 resistance levels.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Solana Price Extends Rally</h2>
<p>Solana price remained strong above the $150 level and extended its <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/sol-price-breaks-150/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">rally</a>. There was a decent increase above the $165 and $180 levels.</p>
<p>The price is up nearly 20% and there was a move above the $200 level, outperforming Bitcoin and <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-grinds-lower-3400/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ethereum</a>. A new multi-month high was formed near $204, and the price is now consolidating gains. It is stable above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $142 swing low to the $204 high.</p>
<p>There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $195 on the 4-hour chart of the SOL/USD pair. Solana is now trading above $200 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Solana_f3319d.png?resize=1024%2C461"><img alt="SOL Price" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-598388" height="461" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Solana_f3319d.png?resize=1024%2C461" width="1024" /></a></p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/SOLUSD/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SOLUSD on TradingView.com</a></p>
<p>Immediate resistance is near the $205 level. The next major resistance is near the $212 level. A successful close above the $212 resistance could set the pace for another major increase. The next key resistance is near $220. Any more gains might send the price toward the $232 level.</p>
<h2>Are Dips Supported in SOL?</h2>
<p>If SOL fails to rally above the $205 resistance, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $195 level and the trend line.</p>
<p>The first major support is near the $175 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $142 swing low to the $204 high, below which the price could test $165. If there is a close below the $165 support, the price could decline toward the $150 support or the 100 simple moving average (4 hours) in the near term.</p>
<p>Technical Indicators</p>
<p>4-Hours MACD – The MACD for SOL/USD is gaining pace in the bullish zone.</p>
<p>4-Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for SOL/USD is above the 50 level.</p>
<p>Major Support Levels – $19, and $175.</p>

<h2>Ethereum Price Dips</h2>
<p>Ethereum price started a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-takes-hit-3680/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">downside correction</a> below the $3,800 and $3,700 levels, like <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-slides-68k/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin</a>. ETH declined below the $3,650 support level to enter a short-term bearish zone.</p>
<p>It even spiked below the $3,500 support zone. A low was formed at $3,414 and the price is now attempting a recovery wave. There was a move above the $3,500 level. Ether climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $4,084 swing high to the $3,414 low.</p>
<p>Ethereum price is now trading below $3,700 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $3,650 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,660 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.</p>
<p>The first major resistance is near the $3,750 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $4,084 swing high to the $3,414 low. The next major resistance is near $3,830, above which the price might gain bullish momentum.</p>

<p>In the stated case, Ether could rally toward the $3,925 level. If there is a move above the $3,925 resistance, Ethereum could even rise toward the $4,000 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of $4,080.</p>
<h2>More Losses In ETH?</h2>
<p>If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,650 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,520 level.</p>
<p>The first major support is near the $3,500 zone. The next key support could be the $3,420 zone. A clear move below the $3,420 support might send the price toward $3,350. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,250 level.</p>
<p>Technical Indicators</p>
<p>Hourly MACD<strong> – </strong>The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bearish zone.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的<br />MEMECOIN项目Book of Meme（BOME）在加密市场上迅速崭露头角，吸引了投资者的兴趣，并在48小时内达到了10亿美元的市值。Book of Meme由DarkFarms创立，旨在结合Meme、去中心化存储解决方案、degen shitcoin交易和赌博，为用户创造新颖的web3体验。BOME在Binance上市后价格急剧上涨243%，市值达到15.5亿美元。投资者从BOME的涨势中受益，有人在预售时以19,000美元的投资获得340倍收益。当前，BOME的价格为0.02139美元，市值为11.8亿美元，居于第85位的加密货币。 <div>
<p>Memecoin project Book of Meme (BOME) has emerged as the latest shining star in the crypto market over the last few days. Following its official launch this week, BOME has attracted much investor interest, acquiring a market cap of $1 billion within 48 hours of trading.</p>
<p>BOME’s sudden emergence can be regarded as a silver lining in the crypto space in the last week amidst Bitcoin’s 4% decline, which resulted in the maiden cryptocurrency falling to around $65,345.14. Meanwhile, Ethereum is also down by 10%, while prominent memecoins <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-influencer-scams/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Dogecoin</a> and <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/behind-the-scenes-of-shiba-inu-12-plunge-what-on-chain-analysis-tells-us/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Shiba Inu</a> also recorded losses to the tune of 24.23% and 16.69% over the last seven days. </p>

<h2>What Is The Book Of Meme?</h2>
<p>The Book of Meme was founded by DarkFarms, the creator of another popular memecoin Pepecoin. BOME functions as an experimental project aimed at incorporating memes, decentralized storage solutions, degen shitcoin trading, and gambling on a single platform in a bid to create a novel web3 experience. </p>
<p>Following a successful presale that raised 10,131 SOL, BOME debuted in the crypto market on March 14 with an initial price of $0.0000496. Over the next two days, Book of Meme swiftly rose to a price region of $0.012 while achieving a market cap value of $1 billion. </p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Due to the sudden listing by Binance, MEMECOIN BOME rose sharply by 243% in 24h, but other MEMECOINs generally fell sharply, PEPE WIF FLOKI BONK fell by more than 10%. The current market value of BOME has exceeded US$1.38 billion, ranking seventh in MEMECOIN in terms of market…</p>
<p>— Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1769015001304781183?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">March 16, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Unsurprisingly, BOME&#8217;s expeditious rise has earned the coin listings on major crypto platforms, including KuCoin, Gate.io, MEXC, HTX, Crypto.com and Binance. In particular, BOME’s listing on Binance on March 16 is believed to have spurred the token to a 243% price gain within a day, allowing the memecoin to gain a peak market cap of $1.55 billion. </p>
<p>In a similar fashion with other highly successful memecoins, some investors have benefitted the most from BOME’s rise.<a href="https://x.com/WuBlockchain/status/1769031149643501757?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> Data from LookonChain</a> reveals that a certain investor already sold all 347 million BOME for 34,647 SOL valued at $6.58 million, recording a 340x gain on 102 ($19,000) investment at the presale. Meanwhile, the largest BOME holding personal address known as sundayfunday.sol currently holds 1.242 billion BOME, valued at $29.8 million. </p>

<h2>BOME Price Overview</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, Book of Meme currently trades at $0.02139 with a 58.08% gain on the last day. Meanwhile, the coin’s daily trading volume is up by 125.05% and is valued at $5.18 billion. BOME’s current market cap stands at $1.18 billion, allowing the memecoin to rank as the 85th largest cryptocurrency. </p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。Shiba Inu目标是达到1000亿美元市值，吸引了加密社区的注意。数据显示持有SHIB代币的地址数量激增，表明零售投资者对Shiba Inu的兴趣和采纳度在增加。大型交易数量也增加，显示机构投资者和鲸鱼积极参与。拥有50%总供应量的前100个地址表明拥有大金额SHIB的持有人对市场有潜在影响。尽管交易活动波动性较大，但Jake Gagain预测Shiba Inu有望超过Dogecoin，并达到1000亿美元市值。 <div>
<p>Shiba Inu, the meme coin sensation, is making headlines once again. With its sights set on a major achievement &#8211; a staggering $100 billion market cap &#8211; Shiba Inu has captured the attention of the crypto community.</p>
<p>This audacious ambition has been fueled by data from IntoTheBlock, shedding light on the coin&#8217;s potential. Additionally, renowned investor Jake Gagain has made a bold prediction, further igniting excitement within the crypto community.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SHIB&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">$SHIB</a> Will Be The First 100 Billion MC Memecoin. <a href="https://t.co/YogeSb2E7q" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/YogeSb2E7q</a></p>
<p>— JAKE (@JakeGagain) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeGagain/status/1768722585221566612?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">March 15, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<h2><strong>Shiba Inu: Growing Interest, Volatile Trading</strong></h2>
<p>According to analysis from IntoTheBlock, SHIB has witnessed a surge in the number of addresses holding the token. This surge indicates a growing interest and adoption of Shiba Inu among retail investors, who are eager to partake in the meme coin revolution.</p>
<p>Moreover, there has been a notable increase in the number of large transactions involving Shiba Inu tokens, suggesting institutional investors and whales are actively engaging with the coin.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-598265" height="216" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_b80e2e.png?resize=388%2C216" width="388" /></p>

<p><a href="https://app.intotheblock.com/register" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">IntoTheBlock&#8217;s data</a> reveals a concentration of wealth among the top holders of Shiba Inu. Approximately 50% of the total supply is held by the top 100 addresses, indicating the potential influence these large holders may have on the market dynamics and price movements of Shiba Inu. This concentration of wealth can play a significant role in shaping the future trajectory of the coin.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/0YSrdCdD/" width="1835" /></p>

<p>Trading activity surrounding the memecoin has also been a focal point of the analysis. The data highlights the volatility of Shiba Inu&#8217;s trading volume, with periods of intense fluctuations followed by relative stability. This volatility can be attributed to various factors, including market sentiment, news events, and overall market conditions.</p>
<h2><strong>SHIB $100 Billion Milestone</strong></h2>
<p>In the midst of this excitement, renowned investor Jake Gagain has made a bold prediction: He firmly believes that Shiba Inu has the potential to surpass Dogecoin and reach a remarkable $100 billion market cap. This prediction has sparked both enthusiasm and skepticism, as the rivalry between Shiba Inu and Dogecoin intensifies.</p>

<p>Taking all these factors into account, the journey towards the billion-dollar market cap for <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/shiba-inu-mania-price-surges-60-as-burn-rate-heats-up-by-over-22000/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Shiba Inu</a> is not without its challenges. While the recent surge in market cap and the accumulation by large holders are positive indicators, the volatility and concentration of wealth present potential risks that need to be navigated.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the resilience and determination exhibited by the memecoin, coupled with the growing interest from retail and institutional investors, provide a strong foundation for its pursuit of the $100 billion milestone.</p>
<p>Shiba Inu&#8217;s quest for a $100 billion market cap represents a paradigm shift in the world of meme coins. Backed by data from IntoTheBlock, which highlights growing adoption, concentration of wealth, and trading activity, as well as the bold prediction from Jake Gagain, SHIB has positioned itself as a formidable contender in the cryptoverse.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。<br />马提克（MATIC）价格出现显著下跌，过去一周下跌超过10%，不到24小时下跌8%。数据显示大约10,900个地址在价位区间$1.02至$1.05购买了6.08亿MATIC，为该区间建立了关键支撑。如果这支撑破裂，下一个重要需求区域位于约$0.91。马提克当前价格为$1.04，市值超过97亿美元，排名第18。 <div>
<p><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/polygon/polygon-matic-whale-deposit-binance-bearish/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">MATIC, the native token of the Polygon network</a>, has witnessed a significant decline in its value. It has fallen by more than 10% in the past week and 8% in less than 24 hours as the general cryptocurrency market continues to grapple with a cloud of negative sentiment.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the latest on-chain analysis has revealed the important levels that investors should look out for following the latest decline in the MATIC price.</p>
<h2>Over 10,900 Addresses Bought 600 Million Polygon Tokens At This Price</h2>
<p>According to a recent <a href="https://x.com/ali_charts/status/1769135468208119809?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post on X</a> by crypto pundit Ali Martinez, the price of MATIC has established a key support around its current price point. This evaluation is based on analytics firm IntoTheBlock’s on-chain data, which tracks the average acquisition price for any given wallet address.</p>
<p><img alt="MATIC" class="aligncenter wp-image-598220 size-large" height="292" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GI06oELX0AA8aSo-1.jpeg?w=860&#038;resize=860%2C292" width="860" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Above is the chart highlighted by <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-long-positions-surge-on-bitfinex-whales-add-4230-btc-signaling-potential-price-reversal/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Martinez</a> that shows the distribution of the Polygon token supply across various price ranges. The size of the dots in the chart represents the magnitude of coins purchased around the corresponding price range.</p>

<p>Most notably, over 10,900 wallet addresses bought a whopping 608 million MATIC around the $1.02 and $1.05 zone. According to the crypto analyst, this massive buying activity has supported the establishment of crucial support around this price region.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Polygon?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">#Polygon</a> has found crucial support between $1.02 and $1.05, supported by 10,900 addresses holding around 608 million <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MATIC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">#MATIC</a>. Should this support falter, the next essential demand zone lies near $0.91, where 35,700 addresses collectively hold 394.6 million <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MATIC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">$MATIC</a>. <a href="https://t.co/rLn4ymcQf7" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/rLn4ymcQf7</a></p>

<p>While the large size of the dot reflects the strength of this particular level, sustained bearish pressure could cause the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/altcoins-watchlist-market-expert-spotlights-eth-blur-matic-and-more-for-explosive-gains/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">price of MATIC to breach</a> and fall beneath this support. In this case, investors could see the cryptocurrency drop to around $0.91.</p>
<p>This makes the $0.89 and $0.92 price range another level to watch, as it represents the next vital support area, where 35,680 wallet addresses purchased nearly 400 million Polygon tokens.</p>
<h2>MATIC Price Overview</h2>
<p>As of this writing, the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/matic/polygon-vesting-matic-price-3/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">price of MATIC</a> stands at $1.04, reflecting an 8% decline in the past 24 hours. This price dip comes after the altcoin printed a multi-month high of $1.28 on Thursday, March 14.</p>
<p>According to data from CoinGecko, the Polygon coin has suffered a 9.7% price slump in the last seven days. From a broader perspective, though, the cryptocurrency has had a fairly positive performance in the past month.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">With a market capitalization of more than $9.7 billion, the MATIC token ranks as the 18th-largest cryptocurrency in the sector.</p>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。比特币价格急剧下跌，导致市场动荡。在过去一周内，比特币价格下跌至65,000美元，其他加密货币也受到影响。市场分析师警告进一步下行风险，市场情绪不佳。总市场清算额超过4.26亿美元，长线交易者损失最严重。市场投资者开始重新评估策略。 <div>
<p>In a tumultuous turn of events, the cryptocurrency market has been rattled by a sharp decline in Bitcoin prices. After a sustained period of remarkable gains and record highs, Bitcoin has plunged to a weekly low of $65,000, marking a significant setback for investors.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bitcoin numbers were all painted in red,</a> and trading at $65,710, losing value in the 24-hour and weekly timeframes by 5.6% and 4.5%, respectively, according to data from Coingecko.</p>
<p>A few days after its previous low of $68,000, Bitcoin plummeted to its present level, a figure not seen in a week, as bears persisted in their downward pressure.</p>



<h2><strong>Altcoins Also Take A Beating</strong></h2>
<p>While Bitcoin bears the brunt of the downturn, altcoins are not spared from the fallout. Ethereum (ETH) and Binance Coin (BNB) have also witnessed<a href="https://coinank.com/liqMapChart" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> substantial losses</a>, shedding 10% of their value or more.</p>
<p>Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, two popular meme coins, have experienced even steeper declines, plunging by 20% and nearly 30%, respectively. The broader altcoin market mirrors Bitcoin&#8217;s downward trajectory, amplifying the sense of unease among investors.</p>

<p>The recent price correction in Bitcoin has reverberated across the cryptocurrency landscape, reshaping market dynamics and investor sentiment. <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">The surge in liquidations</a>, with over 151,000 traders facing margin calls in the past 24 hours, underscores the magnitude of the market upheaval. Bitcoin&#8217;s dominance in the market is evident as it accounts for the lion&#8217;s share of the total liquidations, highlighting its pivotal role in shaping overall market trends.</p>
<p>As a result of the decline in value, the total market liquidations have reached $426 million, with Bitcoin taking the worst hit.</p>

<strong>Liquidation Spree</strong>
<p>The amount that the price of Bitcoin has liquidated over the last 24 hours has exceeded $104 million, with long traders losing the most money—they lost $86 million compared to $18 million for short sellers. Ethereum saw a $48 million overall liquidation, with $33 million going to long traders and $15 million going to short traders, as a result of the losing run.</p>
<strong>Analyst Sounds Alarm Siren</strong>
<p>Meanwhile, market analysts such as Markus Thielen, CEO of 10x Research, have sounded the alarm bells, warning of further downside risks for Bitcoin. Thielen&#8217;s prediction of a potential drop to $63,000 sends a sobering message to investors, urging caution and prudence in navigating the current market environment.</p>
<p>His insights shed light on underlying concerns about Bitcoin&#8217;s market structure, including low trading volumes and liquidity, which exacerbate the risk of sharp price corrections.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-598209" height="340" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_34d7be.png?resize=588%2C340" width="588" /></p>
<p>Amidst the market turbulence, investors are grappling with the implications of Thielen&#8217;s analysis and adjusting their strategies accordingly. The era of meme coin mania appears to be waning, prompting investors to reassess their positions and secure profits while they still can.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。文章提到，Grayscale已向美国证券交易委员会更新了以太坊现货ETF的申请，但随着最近的提醒，SEC批准以太坊现货ETF的成功几率降至35%。两位民主党参议员强烈敦促SEC主席不要批准加密投资产品，并限制未来加密ETF申请。他们指出，这些产品可能给零售投资者带来巨大风险。当前以太坊代币价格为$3,731，过去一天上涨了1.2%。 <div>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-spot-etf-grayscale-outflows/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Asset management firm Grayscale</a> Investments has updated its application for an Ethereum spot ETF (exchange-traded fund) with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<h2 class="p1"><strong>Ethereum Spot ETF Case Just As Solid As Bitcoin’s, Grayscale Argues</strong></h2>
<p class="p1">According to a recent post on X by Craig Salm, Grayscale’s chief legal officer, the asset management firm has <a href="https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/nyse/markets/nyse-arca/rule-filings/filings/2024/SR-NYSEArca-2023-70_Am._1.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">revised its 19b-4 form</a> for an Ether spot ETF. Salm claimed that this move was “important” in an effort for Grayscale to list and trade shares of its Ether Trust on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Arca.</p>
<p class="p1">The chief legal officer <a href="https://x.com/CraigSalm/status/1768750794021511218?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">stated in his post</a> that investors “want and deserve access” to Ethereum via a spot exchange-traded product, likening the situation to the Bitcoin ETF story. “We believe the case is just as strong as it was for spot Bitcoin ETFs,” Salm said.</p>

<p class="p1">The asset manager is amongst the numerous firms <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/approval-denial-ethereum-etf-sell-the-news-event/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">looking to issue the first Ethereum spot ETF</a> in the United States, having filed an application with the SEC on October 10, 2023. However, these ETF applications have faced delays multiple times, with the most recent coming against BlackRock’s filing on March 4, 2024.</p>
<p class="p1">As a result, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-etfs-approval-odds-drop-to-35/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the likelihood</a> of the SEC approving an Ethereum spot ETF has taken a nosedive in recent weeks. Once-optimistic Bloomberg ETF expert Balchunas even revealed in his latest analysis that the ETH funds now have only a 35% chance of approval.</p>












<h2><strong>SEC Chairman Faces Pressure Over Crypto Approval</strong></h2>













<p class="p1">Two US senators of the Democrat party, Sens. Laphonza Butler of California and Jack Reed of Rhode Island, have urged the SEC chairman to avoid approving crypto investment products. In a letter dated March 11, the lawmakers, who are also members of the Senate Banking Committee, asked the Commission to limit future crypto ETF applications.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The success of the BTC spot products clearly ruffling some feathers on the Hill. <a href="https://twitter.com/SenatorJackReed?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">@SenatorJackReed</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Senlaphonza?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">@Senlaphonza</a> write to the <a href="https://twitter.com/SECGov?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">@SECGov</a> urging:-no further ETPs for other tokens-make life difficult (i.e. examinations/reviews) for brokers and advisers that recommend BTC ETPs <a href="https://t.co/enxdumC02N" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/enxdumC02N</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Alexander Grieve (@AlexanderGrieve) <a href="https://twitter.com/AlexanderGrieve/status/1768373756169261076?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">March 14, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p class="p1">Following the approval of 11 Bitcoin spot ETFs in January, the attention of the crypto public has somewhat turned to whether the SEC will do the same for the Ethereum versions. However, this latest letter from the senate seems to further <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-etfs-approval-outlook-fades-ahead-may-23/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">hurt the chances of an ETH ETF approval</a>.</p>

<p class="p1">A part of the letter read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">Retail investors would face enormous risks from ETPs referencing thinly traded cryptocurrencies or cryptocurrencies whose prices are especially susceptible to pump-and-dump or other fraudulent schemes,&#8221; they said. &#8220;The Commission is under no obligation to approve such products, and given the risk, it should not do so.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">As of this writing, the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-takes-hit-3680/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">price of the Ethereum</a> token stands at $3,731, reflecting a 1.2% increase in the past day.</p>
