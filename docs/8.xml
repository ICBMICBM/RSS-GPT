<title>Crypto Outflows Reach New Record High, Will The Bitcoin Decline Continue?</title>

<div> <br><br>摘要：这些信息是消极的。加密投资产品经历了连续七周的资金流入后，终于出现了资金流出的一周，创下了新纪录。上周，投资者从加密投资产品中撤出了9.42亿美元，导致总资产管理规模减少了100亿美元。主要影响因素之一是比特币投资产品的流出，尤其是Grayscale的20亿美元的流出。除了比特币，其他加密货币投资产品也出现了资金流出的情况。最近，比特币的价格受到ETF资金流动的影响，但市场情绪可能正在出现好转。 <div>
<p>Crypto investment products have finally registered a week of outflows after seven weeks of consecutive strong inflows and <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/crypto/crypto-trading-volumes-30-billion/">two weeks of breaking records</a> after records. In fact, data has shown that these investment products have now set a new record for the most outflows in a week, extending the run of record creation.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://blog.coinshares.com/volume-175-digital-asset-fund-flows-weekly-report-6af2a10c0b30" rel="nofollow">data from CoinShares</a>, investors pulled out $942 million from crypto investment products last week to wipe $10 billion off total assets under management (AuM). Interestingly, a larger part of this outflow came from Bitcoin, as Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-etfs-bleed-for-one-week-straight-can-price-recover-to-73000/">registered outflows every day. </a></p>
<h2>Crypto Outflows Reach New Record High</h2>
<p>CoinShares&#8217; weekly report on digital investment funds has revealed crypto investment products have been witnessing an influx of money for the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/crypto-funds-flourish-in-2023-coinshares-reports-2-2-billion-inflow/">past two months</a>. Consequently, these products registered a seven-week run of inflows totaling $12.3 billion. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency, received most of these inflows, which helped push its price to a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/a-new-bitcoin-all-time-high-before-the-halving-is-it-possible/">new all-time high</a>.</p>

<p>However, last week told a different tale for Bitcoin&#8217;s investment products, as Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US registered a weak $1.1 billion in inflows which was unable to offset Grayscale’s significant $2 billion outflows. As a result, Bitcoin investment products witnessed outflows of $904 million throughout last week. Short Bitcoin products also witnessed minor outflows of $3.7 million.</p>
<p>The negative sentiment flowed to other investment <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-sees-notable-rise-in-daily-activity-but-why-is-price-down/">products such as Ethereum</a>, Solana, Cardano, and multi-asset products witnessed outflows of $34.2 million, $5.6 million, $3.7 million, and $7.3 million, respectively. On the other hand, Litecoin, XRP, and Polkadot saw an increase in their respective inflows of $2 million, $1.2 million, and $5 million. Lastly, the total trading volume fell to $28 billion, two-thirds of the prior week. </p>
<p>In terms of region, the USA had the most outflows of $860 million. Sweden and Switzerland followed with $36.9 million and $25.2 million respectively. According to CoinShares, the reversal into a poor sentiment was largely due to hesitancy from investors.</p>
<h2>What’s Next For Bitcoin?</h2>
<p>Interestingly, last week&#8217;s outflow from Spot Bitcoin ETFs coincided with a drastic drop in the price of Bitcoin with the cryptocurrency <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-rejects-68k/">falling to as low as</a> $61,370. This shows how much influence these funds now have over the price of Bitcoin. Last week&#8217;s actions show investors seem to be hitting pause on their enthusiasm for spot bitcoin ETFs. Whether that pause lasts for weeks or longer remains to be seen.</p>

<p>However, sentiment <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-to-50000-or-80000/">can shift quickly</a> in the cryptocurrency market and recent price action shows the industry might be <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-rockets-past-69000-over-60k-traders-caught/">returning to bullish mode</a>. According to <a href="https://x.com/BitMEXResearch/status/1772521628015956435?s=20" rel="nofollow">data from BitMEX Research</a>, Spot Bitcoin ETFs registered a day of net inflows yesterday. Net inflow recorded was $15.7 million, the lowest inflow day since January 26.</p>
<p>Bulls have now taken over to <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-surges-past-71000-4-key-reasons/">push the price of Bitcoin</a> by 5.38% in the past 24 hours. At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $70,676 and <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-reclaims-70k/">could reach $73,000 again</a> very soon.</p>

<title>Hold Onto Your Seats: XRP Primed For 90% Rally, According To Top Analyst</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/hold-onto-your-seats-xrp-primed-for-90-rally-according-to-top-analyst/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章介绍了XRP分析师EGRAG的预测，他预测XRP可能会涨幅90%，目标价为$1.20。他认为XRP的3天图上出现的“W”波形是牛市的前兆。他还预测XRP在未来可能达到$27。然而，市场动态复杂，包括Ripple与SEC的法律纠纷。尽管XRP的价格出现调整，但一些分析师仍然看好未来的价格走势。 <div>
<p>Renowned XRP analyst EGRAG has ignited a firestorm of excitement and skepticism with his bold prediction for the cryptocurrency. EGRAG, known for his bullish XRP stances, is calling for a potential 90% surge in the near future, with a target price of $1.20. This forecast hinges on a technical pattern identified by EGRAG – a &#8220;W&#8221; wave formation on XRP&#8217;s 3-day chart, which he believes historically precedes bull runs.</p>

<h2><strong>XRP Long-Term Outlook</strong></h2>
<p>The prediction has sent ripples through the XRP community. Enthusiasts are buoyed by the prospect of such a significant price jump. However, the forecast is not without its cracks. EGRAG himself acknowledges a potential worst-case scenario where XRP could plummet by 30% to around $0.44. This has some investors wary, questioning the possibility of a revisit to such lows.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/XRP?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">#XRP</a> Wave 10 ( $1 &#8211; $1.2) <img alt="🌊" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f30a.png" style="height: 1em;" /><img alt="🔟" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f51f.png" style="height: 1em;" />:</p>
<p>The 10th &#8220;W&#8221; Pattern is exceptionally well-aligned with the current market setup, signaling a potentially significant move.</p>
<p>Target Prices Remain Consistent:</p>
<p>1) Non-Logarithmic: $1
2) Logarithmic: $1.2<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/XRPArmy?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">#XRPArmy</a> STAY STEADY and Appreciate the… <a href="https://t.co/PS6xZi1FFv" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/PS6xZi1FFv</a></p>
<p>— EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) <a href="https://twitter.com/egragcrypto/status/1771841032147132701?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">March 24, 2024</a></p></blockquote>












<p>Furthermore, EGRAG emphasizes that his bullish outlook extends far beyond the immediate future, projecting an astonishing long-term target of $27 for XRP by November. This audacious forecast is rooted in his meticulous analysis of XRP&#8217;s current moving averages juxtaposed with those observed during the remarkable price surge of 2017.</p>
<p>Drawing parallels between the two periods, EGRAG highlights the uncanny resemblance, hinting at the potential for history to repeat itself with a resurgence akin to the explosive growth witnessed in the past. He underscores the importance of considering historical patterns and market dynamics in shaping his optimistic perspective, indicating a belief in XRP&#8217;s capacity for substantial growth over the coming months.</p>












<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/QtgwTO7z/" width="1835" /></p>

<h2><strong>Complex Market Dynamics</strong></h2>
<p>However, analysts urge caution when interpreting such technical indicators. While historical patterns can offer valuable insights, they are not guarantees of future performance. The cryptocurrency market remains notoriously volatile, and unforeseen events can drastically alter price trajectories.</p>
<p>Further complicating the picture is the ongoing legal battle between Ripple Labs, the company behind <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/xrp" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">XRP</a>, and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The lawsuit&#8217;s outcome holds the potential to significantly impact XRP&#8217;s price. A favorable ruling for Ripple could pave the way for wider adoption and a subsequent price increase. Conversely, an unfavorable verdict could cripple investor confidence and send XRP tumbling.</p>


<p>Beyond the technical analysis and legal wrangles, XRP&#8217;s long-term success hinges on its real-world utility. XRP is designed to facilitate cross-border payments, offering faster and cheaper transactions compared to traditional methods. Widespread adoption by financial institutions for this purpose would be a major driver of XRP&#8217;s value.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Despite the negativity, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/XRP?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">#XRP</a> is closing its three-monthly candle in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/March?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">#March</a> by breaking the multi-year resistance. There is one week left to close the last candle.</p>
<p>Above it;</p>
<p>The initial targets will be $1.8815-$5.8563 (NFA)</p>
<p>Enjoy your day!<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ripple?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">#ripple</a> <a href="https://t.co/YzZIWaOhFR" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/YzZIWaOhFR</a></p>
<p>— Dark Defender (@DefendDark) <a href="https://twitter.com/DefendDark/status/1771838992331239629?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">March 24, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, the asset&#8217;s recent price correction hasn&#8217;t deterred pro-XRP analysts, who believe this might be the start of a huge rally in the near future.</p>
<p>Dark Defender, an X user, pointed out that in the last six months, XRP has already seen two straight three-monthly green candles. A third candle of this kind, according to the analyst, would spark an exponential rise that raises the token&#8217;s price to between $1.88 and $5.85.</p>

Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.820 resistance.</p>

<title>Triple-Digit Gains: Ondo Finance (ONDO) Explodes 138% — Should You Invest?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。Ondo Finance（ONDO）的本地代币价格在过去一周内迅速上涨，达到历史新高。分析师认为这一涨势归功于鲸鱼投资者大笔买入ONDO，并吸引了更多零售投资者。尽管价格飙升，但平台的总锁定价值（TVL）保持相对稳定，可能引起一些投资者的担忧。总体来看，Ondo Finance的未来前景看好，但长期可持续性取决于真实世界资产的采用和生态系统的持续发展。 <div>
<p>Ondo Finance (ONDO), a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol focused on tokenizing US treasuries, has witnessed a meteoric rise in its native token&#8217;s price over the past week. According to CoinMarketCap, although ONDO was only able to muster a meager 1.3% increase in the last day &#8211; pushing its value to a record-breaking $0.94 &#8211; the impressive feat comes on the heels of a <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ondo" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">138% weekly gain,</a> marking an impressive performance for the token.</p>

<h2><strong>ONDO Marks Banner Week With Big Numbers</strong></h2>

<p>Analysts attribute this surge to a confluence of factors. Whale investors, known for their significant holdings and market influence, have been accumulating ONDO at a substantial clip. Data from on-chain tracking platform Lookonchain reveals that three whale wallets recently withdrew over 9 million ONDOs, worth around $9 million, from various exchanges. This behavior suggests a long-term bullish outlook on the token&#8217;s potential, potentially inciting a follow-the-leader mentality among retail investors.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Indeed, Santiment data analyzed by AMBCrypto shows a 30% increase in the total number of ONDO holders since March 19th, surpassing the 10,000 mark. This influx of new investors, likely influenced by the whales&#8217; actions and the overall hype surrounding tokenization, has further fueled the token&#8217;s price rally.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/yC8rtPfJ/" width="2475" /></p>

<p>The recent surge in ONDO&#8217;s popularity coincides with a broader trend within the DeFi space. Last week, global investment giant BlackRock announced the creation of a tokenized fund on the Ethereum blockchain, allowing investors to earn US dollar yields through a decentralized platform. This move underscores the growing interest in tokenization, which involves representing real-world assets like securities, currencies, and real estate on a blockchain.</p>
<h2><strong>TVL Not Impressive Despite Weekly Rise</strong></h2>
<p>However, amidst the celebratory atmosphere surrounding the token&#8217;s price surge, a curious detail emerges. Despite the significant increase in ONDO&#8217;s value, the platform&#8217;s total value locked (TVL), a metric reflecting the total value of crypto assets deposited in its DeFi protocols, has remained relatively stagnant over the past week. While the reasons behind this discrepancy are unclear, it could be a cause for concern for some investors. A stagnant TVL might suggest that the recent price increase isn&#8217;t necessarily translating to increased usage of the Ondo Finance protocol itself.</p>

<p>Overall, the past week has been undeniably positive for Ondo Finance. The token&#8217;s impressive price surge, coupled with the current tokenization hype and strategic alignment with BlackRock&#8217;s recent venture, paints a promising picture for the future. However, the stagnant TVL serves as a reminder that long-term sustainability hinges not just on speculation but also on real-world adoption and the continued development of the Ondo Finance ecosystem.</p>

<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-surges-past-71000-4-key-reasons/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />比特币价格突破了71,000美元的关隘，过去24小时内上涨了6.5％。主要推动因素包括期货市场影响、乐观的比特币新闻、比特币ETF和Coinbase溢价、以及技术突破。开放利息的急剧增加，激起了比特币价格的涨势。伦敦证券交易所宣布将推出比特币和以太坊交易所交易票据，加强了对机构投资者的接受度。Coinbase溢价转为正值，显示了对实物比特币ETF的强劲需求。比特币价格成功突破了对抗性区域，技术上的突破巩固了交易者和投资者的信心，推动价格超过70,000美元。 <div>
<p>The Bitcoin price has soared past the $71,000 mark. In the past 24 hours alone, the price of Bitcoin surged by 6.5%, climbing from just below $65,500 to reach $71,491. This remarkable rally can be attributed to a combination of factors that have collectively contributed to the upward trajectory of the world&#8217;s leading cryptocurrency. Here&#8217;s a closer look at the four key reasons behind Bitcoin&#8217;s latest price surge.</p>
<h2>#1 Futures Market Influence</h2>
<p>The futures market has played a pivotal role in driving Bitcoin&#8217;s price upwards. According to <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">data</a> from Coinglass, the past 24 hours have seen the liquidation of 64,480 traders, with total crypto liquidations amounting to $184 million. Specifically, for Bitcoin, shorts worth $56.9 million and longs worth $16 million were liquidated.</p>
<p>Byzantine General, a crypto analyst, <a href="https://twitter.com/ByzGeneral/status/1772292916213338411" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">noted</a> the significant increase in open interest, suggesting that leverage has been a major factor propelling Bitcoin&#8217;s price higher. He stated, “I can&#8217;t help but have the feeling that BTC is trading like someone knows something. A billion $ in open interest got added in the past couple hours. It&#8217;s mostly this leverage that pushed us higher I think.”</p>

<p>Furkan Yildirim, another analyst, <a href="https://twitter.com/FurkanCCTV/status/1772270249175400626" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">cautioned</a> about the sustainability of this rally, pointing out the over $1.7 billion in open interest built up since yesterday as a sign of overleveraged positions. “The whole truth is that over $1.7 billion in open interest has been built up since yesterday. We are increasingly seeing the use of overleveraged positions again,” he remarked, raising questions of the sustainability of the move.</p>
#2 Bullish News For Bitcoin
<p>The rally was further propelled by a series of optimistic news. Notably, the London Stock Exchange (LSE) announced its plan to introduce a market for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) exchange-traded notes (ETNs) by May 28. This decision opens the door to professional investors in Europe and signifies the growing institutional acceptance.</p>

<p>Moreover, the news of Peruvian Nilam Resources <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-peruvian-gold-miner-1-7-billion/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">expressing intent</a> to purchase 24,800 Bitcoins (worth $1.7 billion) &#8220;at a discounted rate relative to current market prices&#8221; through an acquisition strategy involving MindWave, a special purpose entity, has injected a dose of exhilaration and skepticism into the market, given Nilam&#8217;s microcap OTC stock status.</p>
#3 Bitcoin ETFs And Coinbase Premium
<p>Another critical factor influencing Bitcoin&#8217;s price rally was the dynamics surrounding Bitcoin ETFs and the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-coinbase-premium-negative-price-recovery/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Coinbase premium</a>. The Coinbase Premium Gap turned positive again yesterday, as observed by CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn, indicating a robust demand for spot Bitcoin ETFs.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Guess who's back? Bitcoin: Coinbase Premium Gap is positive again <a href="https://t.co/0C7YyyFe2T" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/0C7YyyFe2T</a> <a href="https://t.co/b73XbSygbl" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/b73XbSygbl</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Maartunn (@JA_Maartun) <a href="https://twitter.com/JA_Maartun/status/1772310510182060270?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">March 25, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Given Coinbase&#8217;s <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/coinbase/coinbase-custody-accounts-for-90-of-all-bitcoin-etfs-details/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">custodianship of approximately 90%</a> of Bitcoin ETF assets, the premium emerges as a pivotal indicator of institutional demand for Bitcoin. This was further evidenced by the positive ETF net inflows yesterday, amounting to $15.4 million after last week saw five consecutive days of net outflows.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-spot-etf-grayscale-outflows/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Grayscale’s GBTC</a> had $350 million in outflows. Meanwhile, Fidelity’s FBTC started picking up last week&#8217;s slack with $261.8 million in inflows. Blackrock had another weak day with only $35 million in inflows. Nonetheless, the Coinbase premium was once again a good indicator.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Yesterday's ETF flows were positive once again after a negative week for $15.4 million.<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GBTC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">$GBTC</a> had $350 million in outflows. Fidelity started picking up last week's slack with $261.8 million in inflows.Blackrock only did $35 million.</p>
<p>Price moved from $65k to above $70k. A day… <a href="https://t.co/HCNwa7L2p8" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/HCNwa7L2p8</a></p>

<p></p>
#4 Technical Breakout
<p>From a technical perspective, Bitcoin&#8217;s price breakout from a descending parallel trend channel on the 4-hour chart marked a crucial turning point. The successful retest of the strong resistance zone (red zone) has confirmed the breakout&#8217;s legitimacy, leading to a more than 7% increase in Bitcoin&#8217;s price. This technical movement has bolstered the confidence of traders and investors alike, contributing to the momentum that has driven the price past the $70,000 threshold.</p>

<title>Solana (SOL) Breaks Through Key Resistance, Analyst Forecasts $250 Price Target</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-sol-breaks-through-key-resistance-analyst-forecasts-250-price-target/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-sol-breaks-through-key-resistance-analyst-forecasts-250-price-target/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br /> Solana（SOL）的价格在过去24小时内上涨超过9％，超过了市值最大的加密货币。分析师预测SOL价格将继续上涨，有望突破先前的最高点。市场活动增加，交易量大幅增长。Solana的关键指标显示投资者对其区块链的使用和采纳率上升，包括完全稀释市值、市值、交易费和收入等数据。这些数据表明SOL可能会保持向目前的历史最高点走势。 <div>
<p>Solana (SOL) has experienced a notable resurgence in its bullish momentum, with a rebound of over 9% in the past 24 hours. This notable performance has outpaced the<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/leading-the-pack-solana-captures-nearly-50-of-global-crypto-attention/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> top 10</a> largest cryptocurrencies in terms of market capitalization.</p>
<p>The latest surge in SOL&#8217;s price has allowed it to surpass its resistance level on the daily chart at $184. The remaining hurdle of $201 now stands as the final barrier to prevent further gains for the cryptocurrency. </p>
<p>However, industry experts and crypto analysts suggest that SOL&#8217;s price action indicates a potential continuation towards its previous all-time high of $259, achieved during the market&#8217;s bullish run in November 2021.</p>
<h2>SOL  Price Expected To Breakout And Target All-Time Highs</h2>
<p>One analyst, &#8220;Jelle,&#8221; <a href="https://x.com/CryptoJelleNL/status/1772177923388198984?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">highlights </a>SOL&#8217;s successful transformation of the last significant resistance level into support, suggesting a positive outlook for the token&#8217;s future. The analyst predicts that the SOL price will continue to rise and potentially exceed $250 by the summer.</p>

<p>Similarly, another analyst using the pseudonym Mikybull <a href="https://x.com/MikybullCrypto/status/1772256054174203997?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">points out</a> that SOL is currently consolidating within a symmetrical triangle pattern on a daily timeframe. </p>
<img alt="Solana" class="size-large wp-image-599645" height="488" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GJhQC_3WAAAQ9I1.jpeg?w=860&#038;resize=860%2C488" width="860" />
<p>According to the analyst, a breakout from this pattern is expected to trigger an “explosive” price movement, aiming to reach its previous <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-whale-1000000-sol-binance-bearish/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">all-time high levels</a> at around $255.</p>
<p>Supporting SOL&#8217;s renewed bullish momentum, CoinGecko <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/solana" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">data </a>reveals a significant increase in trading volume, with $4,514,426,127 traded in the last 24 hours. This represents a 74.20% surge compared to the previous day, indicating a notable surge in market activity. </p>
<h2>Solana Metrics Demonstrate Growing Investor Interest </h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://tokenterminal.com/terminal/projects/solana" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">data </a>from Token Terminal, Solana&#8217;s key metrics further highlight the use and adoption of its blockchain among investors. Starting with market capitalization, the fully diluted market capitalization is $99.32 billion. This figure represents the total market value if all tokens were in circulation. The fully diluted market capitalization over the past 30 days has increased by 70.0%. </p>
<p>On the other hand, the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-ethereum-surge-200/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">circulating market cap</a>, which only considers the tokens currently in circulation, is valued at $77.05 billion. It has witnessed a 30-day growth of 71.3%.</p>
<img alt="Solana" class="size-large wp-image-599644" height="345" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot_87.jpg?w=634&#038;resize=634%2C345" width="634" />
<p>Examining fees generated through transactions on the Solana network, the 30-day fees amount to $51.46 million. This represents a notable surge of 220.7% within 30 days, highlighting increased <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana-memecoin-presale-gone-wrong-creator-accidentally-burns-10m-whale-makes-huge-profit/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">network usage </a>and demand. When annualized, the fees reach $626.15 million.</p>

<p>In terms of revenue, Solana has seen positive growth. The 30-day revenue is $25.73 million, reflecting a significant increase of 220.7% over the past month. When annualized, the revenue amounts to $313.08 million, showing the sustainable income generation within the Solana network.</p>
<img alt="Solana" class="size-large" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/Gwc8sKpO/" width="1815" />
<p>It remains to be seen if these metrics and bullish momentum will sustain SOL&#8217;s path to its current all-time highs.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要: 这些信息是积极的。<br />加密货币市场近期发生了重大清算，导致超过2亿美元的资金流失，因为比特币突破了69000美元。这次比特币价格飙升导致许多做空头寸被清算，造成各个交易平台的显著财务影响。液化事件的细节显示，大约60388名交易者在短短24小时内面临逾2亿美元的损失。OKX交易者损失最高，达到8119万美元，紧随其后的是币安的8040万美元清算。分析人士和交易者正在密切关注比特币的下一步动向，推测新高的可能性。加密货币分析师Cryptoyoddha对比特币未来提供了乐观的展望，认为比特币即将进入一个新的循环，可能推动比特币的价值达到15万美元或更高。伯恩斯坦分析师调整了他们对比特币年底价格的预测，提出更为乐观的观点。标准特易银行也调高了他们对比特币年底价值的预测，认为比特币可能在年底达到15万美元。 <div>
<p>The cryptocurrency market recently witnessed significant liquidations, totaling over $200 million, as Bitcoin surged past the $69,000 mark.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin price surge led to many short positions being liquidated, causing notable financial repercussions across various trading platforms.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin&#8217;s Sudden Rebound And Liquidations</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">data</a> from Coinglass provide a clearer picture of the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-might-be-poised-for-a-double-pump/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">impact</a>, showing that around 60,388 traders and counting faced losses exceeding $200 million in just 24 hours.</p>
<p>The distribution of these liquidations varied among the major exchanges, with OKX traders experiencing the highest losses at $81.19 million, narrowly surpassing Binance&#8217;s $80.40 million in liquidations.</p>
<p>Bybit and Huobi also reported significant figures of $18.98 million and $17.05 million in liquidations, highlighting the widespread effect of Bitcoin&#8217;s unexpected rally.</p>
<p>The resurgence of Bitcoin to over $69,000 was particularly noteworthy, given its position below $66,000 in the early hours of Monday. While the exact catalyst for this abrupt rise remains uncertain, it puts Bitcoin a few dollars in value away from reclaiming its previous all-time high of $73,000.</p>
<img alt="BTC price chart on TradingView" class="size-medium" height="1496" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/PUyKMoSH/" width="2770" />
<p>Analysts and traders are now closely watching the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/hold-your-horses-buying-the-crypto-dip-is-still-too-early-warns-top-analyst-heres-why/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">market</a> for signs of Bitcoin’s next move, with speculation about the potential for new record highs in the near term.</p>

<h2>Looking Ahead: Bitcoin Bullish Prospects</h2>
<p>Crypto analyst Cryptoyoddha has provided an optimistic outlook for Bitcoin&#8217;s future, suggesting that the cryptocurrency is on the cusp of<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-real-pump-nears-new-all-time-highs-analyst-says/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> entering a new phase of its cycle</a> that could see it reaching unprecedented heights.</p>
<p>According to Cryptoyoddha, Bitcoin&#8217;s historical pattern of accumulation, followed by a parabolic surge, sets the stage for what he terms “Cycle IV,” a period that could potentially elevate Bitcoin’s value to $150,000 or more.</p>
<p>According to the analyst, factors such as increased institutional investment, evolving regulatory clarity, and growing public acceptance of digital assets are key drivers of this bullish sentiment.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Bernstein analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra recently updated their forecast for Bitcoin&#8217;s year-end price, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-new-ath-by-year-end/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">elevating it from an initial $80,000 to $90,000</a>.</p>
<p>This adjustment was prompted by notable factors such as the robust inflow into Spot Bitcoin ETFs and earnings from mining activities, which have contributed to a more optimistic outlook on Bitcoin’s valuation.</p>
<p>Additionally, they maintained that Bitcoin is on track to reach $150,000 by mid-2025, attributing this anticipated growth to several elements, including the impact of Spot Bitcoin <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/beyond-bitcoin-etfs-there-are-other-players/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">ETFs</a>, which they expect to drive a significant upswing in the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price.</p>

<p>Similarly, Standard Chartered has<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/standard-chartered-bitcoin-ethereum-prediction-year-end/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> revised its prediction</a> for Bitcoin&#8217;s end-of-year value. Moving beyond their original estimate of $100,000, the institution now suggests that Bitcoin could ascend to $150,000 by year&#8217;s end, citing the catalytic role of Bitcoin ETFs in fostering their positive outlook on the asset’s future performance.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。根据最近的报道，澳新银行集团（ANZ）与Chainlink实验室合作，探索在链数字资产在全球移动和结算中的潜力。他们利用Chainlink的CCIP将Avalanche和以太坊区块链连接起来，以实现不间断的交付与支付结算。 ANZ利用Avalanche的Evergreen子网展示了如何使用定制网络来探索新的用例和业务模型。最终结果表明，测试交易是有希望的，这一举措可能改变金融服务行业处理链资产的方式。 AVAX加密货币价格接近22个月高点，跳涨九个百分点。 <div>
<p>According to a recent <a href="https://www.avax.network/blog/anz-leverages-avalanche-and-chainlink-in-tokenized-asset-settlement-project" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement </a>from blockchain platform Avalanche (AVAX), Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) has partnered with Chainlink (LINK) Labs to explore the potential of on-chain digital assets for global movement and settlement. </p>
<p>Using Chainlink&#8217;s <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/avalanche/avalanche-unleashes-durango-upgrade-avax-price-rockets-8-with-teleporter-debut/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol</a> (CCIP), the collaboration aims to connect the Avalanche and Ethereum (ETH) blockchains to enable uninterrupted delivery versus payment (DvP) settlement of tokenized assets across networks in multiple currencies.</p>
<h2>Tokenized Asset Transaction Across Avalanche And Ethereum Using Chainlink</h2>
<p>ANZ, a provider of banking products and services to millions of customers in nearly 30 markets, has reportedly taken an unusual approach to exploring the world of on-chain digital assets. </p>
<p>By leveraging Chainlink&#8217;s CCIP, ANZ is validating how customers can access, trade, and settle tokenized assets across <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-avalanche-bonk-pepe/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">multiple networks</a> and currencies using Delivery vs. Payment. This approach aims to improve settlement efficiency and risk management for digital assets that fall under the classification of &#8220;securities&#8221; and their transactions.</p>

<p>According to Avalanche, Chainlink&#8217;s CCIP has been &#8220;crucial&#8221; in abstracting the complexities of moving tokenized assets across various blockchains, ensuring “atomic” cross-chain Delivery vs. Payment settlement. </p>
<p>Notably, within the collaboration, ANZ simulated a transaction where a customer used ANZ&#8217;s Digital Asset Services (DAS) portal to purchase tokenized ANZ-issued New Zealand dollar stablecoins (NZ$DC) on Avalanche.  </p>
<p>Subsequently, the customer purchased tokenized Australian nature-based assets issued as <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/breaking-news-ticker/avalanche-c-chain-experiences-block-production-halt-avax-price-responds/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">non-fungible tokens</a> (NFTs), denominated in tokenized ANZ-issued Australian dollar stablecoins (A$DC), on Ethereum. </p>
<p>Furthermore, ANZ facilitated the FX conversion between the two currencies, while CCIP provided the necessary infrastructure to transfer tokens and data between Ethereum and Avalanche.</p>
<h2>ANZ Harnesses Avalanche&#8217;s Evergreen Subnet</h2>
<p>Monday&#8217;s announcement also revealed that ANZ used its Avalanche Evergreen Subnet for the project, leveraging its <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/injective/inj-price-soars-13-as-injective-unveils-inevm-ethereum-and-solana-integration-expected/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ethereum Virtual Machine </a>(EVM) compatibility, permissioning, and custom gas token features. </p>
<p>The Evergreen Subnet allowed ANZ to explore new use cases and business models using customizable networks like Avalanche.</p>
<p>ANZ&#8217;s collaboration with Chainlink and Avalanche showcases how traditional financial institutions embrace <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/academy/buy-sell-trade-ethereum-network/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">blockchain technology</a> to enhance capital markets. </p>
<p>Ultimately, Avalanche revealed that the initial results of the test transactions were promising, and the initiative could change how the financial services industry approaches tokenized assets. </p>
<p>The next steps include deploying the solution on blockchain mainnets and extending the workflows to include communication between different blockchain networks for different use cases.</p>
AVAX Nears 22-Month High 
<p>At the time of writing, Avalanche&#8217;s token AVAX has been on a steady uptrend, resulting in a remarkable increase of over 60% in the last 30 days. Currently, the token is trading at $58.31, just below its 22-month high of $65 set on Monday the 18th.</p>
<p>Within the last 24 hours, AVAX experienced a 9% increase after the announcement of the collaboration with Chainlink and ANZ Group. This surge allowed the token to break through the $55<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/avax-slips-adding-tension-to-365-million-avalanche-token-unlock-drama/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> resistance level</a>. However, the $60 level is expected to be another obstacle that could lead to a consolidation period between $55 and $60 should the bullish momentum fade.</p>

<img alt="Avalanche" class="size-large" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/laa0QQuK/" width="1815" />
<p>Further demonstrating the interest in AVAX, the token&#8217;s trading volume in the last 24 hours reached $1,135,122,192, indicating a significant increase of 127.20% compared to the previous day. </p>

<title>Ethereum’s Rocky Road To $4,000: Will SEC Hurdles Derail Its Bullish Journey?</title>

<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-rocky-road-to-4000-will-sec-hurdles-derail-its-bullish-journey/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的<br />1. Ethereum（ETH）正努力突破4,000美元的价格关口。<br />2. 技术分析显示ETH可能会回升，并且有望逐步恢复其估值。<br />3. SEC对以太坊进行监管审查，可能影响其前景。<br />4. 尽管市场条件严峻，ETH网络活动增长强劲，表明潜力。<br />5. 以太坊面临SEC监管挑战，但网络强劲且用户参与度增加，为其未来提供希望。 <div>
<p>Ethereum (ETH) stands at a crucial juncture, with its eyes set on the $4,000 price mark. Amid this ambitious pursuit, the digital asset faces a significant challenge that could influence its trajectory: scrutiny from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<p>Despite this potential regulatory hurdle, some analysts remain optimistic about Ethereum&#8217;s prospects. A detailed <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoFaibik/status/1772128321255395702?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">analysis</a> by Captain Faibik, a market watcher, highlighted a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-strength-3580/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">bullish pattern</a> in ETH’s four-hour candlestick chart, suggesting that the $4,000 threshold is within reach.</p>

<h2>Ethereum Eyes $4,000 Milestone</h2>
<p>This optimism stems from a descending wedge pattern observed by Faibik, indicating an end to Ethereum&#8217;s consolidation phase and signaling a possible price breakout. The technical analysis paints a promising picture for Ethereum, suggesting that the asset could reclaim its lost valuation.</p>

<p>— Captain Faibik (@CryptoFaibik) <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoFaibik/status/1772128321255395702?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">March 25, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>However, the recent market conditions have posed challenges for Ethereum, with the asset experiencing a more than 15% drop over two weeks, further exacerbated by the broader Bitcoin market correction.</p>
<p>This decline saw ETH trading below the $3,500 mark, with a significant dip to $3,070 on March 20, amid <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-20/ethereum-foundation-gets-sec-scrutiny-in-latest-crypto-crackdown" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reports</a> of the SEC&#8217;s increasing interest in classifying Ethereum as a security.</p>
<p>Particularly, reports indicate that the commission has been seeking financial records from US companies engaged with the Ethereum Foundation, intensifying the debate over Ethereum&#8217;s classification. Such regulatory scrutiny casts a shadow over Ethereum&#8217;s path to $4,000, introducing <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-faces-potential-downfall-as-dencun-upgrade-looms/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">uncertainty into its future</a>.</p>
<p>ETF analyst James Seyffart suggests that the SEC&#8217;s stance could lead to the denial of spot Ethereum ETF applications by May 23, 2024. He cites a lack of engagement on Ethereum specifics, contrasting with the approach taken for Bitcoin ETFs.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">My cautiously optimistic attitude for ETH ETFs has changed from recent months. We now believe these will ultimately be denied May 23rd for this round. The SEC hasn&#8217;t engaged with issuers on Ethereum specifics.

<h2>Ethereum&#8217;s Network Activity: A Silver Lining</h2>
<p>Despite these challenges, Ethereum&#8217;s network has witnessed notable growth, with <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-sees-notable-rise-in-daily-activity-but-why-is-price-down/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">increases in daily active users and transaction volumes</a> signaling a bullish outlook for the cryptocurrency. An upsurge in network activity typically indicates heightened demand, a positive sign for Ethereum&#8217;s <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-new-5000-target/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">price potential</a>.</p>
<p>From January 3, the number of<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/march-sees-nearly-1-billion-in-ethereum-netflow-to-centralized-exchanges-whats-happening/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> daily active</a> Ethereum addresses surged by over 46%, coinciding with a significant price rally. This increased activity and price appreciation period highlights Ethereum&#8217;s resilience and potential for growth, even in the face of regulatory uncertainties.</p>
<p>As Ethereum navigates through these regulatory and market challenges, the coming weeks will be critical in determining its ability to breach the $4,000 mark. The juxtaposition of technical bullish signals against the backdrop of SEC scrutiny presents a complex scenario for ETH.</p>

<p>However, the strength of its network and the increasing user engagement offer a glimmer of hope for Ethereum enthusiasts and investors.</p>

<title>Is Jupiter’s Next Leg Up Coming? Crypto Analyst Weighs In As JUP Surges 13%</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/is-jupiters-next-leg-up-coming-crypto-analyst-weighs-in-as-jup-surges-13/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/is-jupiters-next-leg-up-coming-crypto-analyst-weighs-in-as-jup-surges-13/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。Jupiter（JUP）在过去一个月里表现出色，价格上涨超过150％。 加密市场放缓和一些争议中，JUP的表现仍保持势头。加密分析师认为JUP的现在是一个“不错的”入场点。他观察到JUP最近的表现，并指出这可能是一个好的入场时机。 JUP的价格走势显示出价格震荡，并且近期阶段表现良好。 Meow的一项有争议的决定引起了社区的不满，但JUP的价格似乎未受影响。最近24小时里，Jupiter的交易量激增了64.1％。 JUP市值在过去一天内增加了8.5％，目前排名第65位。<br /> <div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Jupiter (JUP) has had a remarkable month, with its price skyrocketing over 150% in the last 30 days. Amid the crypto market slowdown and some controversies, JUP’s performance has maintained momentum.</p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto Analyst Sees &#8220;Decent&#8221; Entry Spot For JUP</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana-jupiter-jup-price-tumbles-controversy/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Jupiter’s</a> JUP started the month trading around $0.63 and has seen the price jump 106% in 25 days. The token’s performance this month showed sideways price action before climbing to a new support level twice, which could suggest that another price surge is possible despite the turbulent week.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In an X post, renowned crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa commented on JUP’s most recent performance as he wondered about the possibility of a leg up.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24JUP&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">$JUP</a>: Wondering if next leg is coming for JUPITER&#8230;consolidation and looks ok + btc looks somewhat stable (for now). Might be a decent spot entry here. <a href="https://t.co/uE8IHblbFY" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/uE8IHblbFY</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Altcoin Sherpa (@AltcoinSherpa) <a href="https://twitter.com/AltcoinSherpa/status/1772079659984802211?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">March 25, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The analyst shared JUP’s price chart, which displayed the token’s sideways movement inside the $1.12-$1.47 price range for the past few days. The chart shows that the consolidation phase started after the token’s price jumped and unsuccessfully tested the $1.50 resistance level on March 16.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">After a pullback to the $1.20 mark, JUP retested the resistance zone again on March 18, briefly reaching $1.60, but ultimately failed to maintain it. Following the unsuccessful attempts to climb, the price dipped even lower to the $1.10 support zone in the following days.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, JUP has bounced back, hovering between the $1.15-$1.25 zone. The recent price consolidation looks “ok,” according to the analyst. He further highlights <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-retests-resistance-level-break-lead/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin’s</a> current stability, seemingly suggesting to Sherpa that JUP could repeat its March trajectory.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, the analyst deems this moment as a “decent entry spot” for Jupiter’s token. Additionally, he has shown a positive sentiment towards JUP before, calling the token a “winner” that’s “gonna keep on winning.”</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">winners gonna keep on winning. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24PYTH&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">$PYTH</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24JUP&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">$JUP</a> are some of the great ones. <a href="https://t.co/nL4BmzxFJo" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/nL4BmzxFJo</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Altcoin Sherpa (@AltcoinSherpa) <a href="https://twitter.com/AltcoinSherpa/status/1768842957140963801?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">March 16, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">JUP’s Price Action</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, JUP’s Community showed some <a href="https://x.com/DeNomics_/status/1770061164829122893?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">concerns</a> after its co-founder Meow announced a controversial decision. Meow revealed on X that Jupiter would donate the SLERF limit order and DCA fees to the token’s presale participants.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This decision was taken without consulting the community, a crucial part of the project. After the criticism, Meow explained that &#8220;no JUP tokens were involved in the donation and, despite the turbulence in the community, JUP’s price didn’t seem to be affected.&#8221;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It’s worth noting that Bitcoin’s price showed stabilization signs over the weekend, as highlighted by Sherpa. This matters as JUP followed BTC’s trajectory closely over the last week. As the chart below shows, the Solana-based token mimicked the moves of the flagship cryptocurrency.</p>
<p><img alt="crypto, BTC, JUP" class="size-large wp-image-599594 aligncenter" height="514" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Captura-de-Pantalla-2024-03-25-a-las-8.01.33-a.-m.png?w=741&#038;resize=741%2C514" width="741" /></p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">In the last 24 hours, Jupiter’s trading volume has surged 64.1%, with $214.7 million being traded. According to CoinMarketCap data, JUP’s market capitalization increased 8.5% in the past day, placing the token as the 65th largest cryptocurrency by this metric, with $1.77 billion.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the negative 3.5% <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/altcoin-season-bitcoin-performance/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">performance</a> in the past week, the token exhibits a significant 71.8% price jump in the biweekly timeframe. At the time of writing, JUP is trading at $1.33, a 13.2% surge in the last day.</p>

<title>Bitcoin To $50,000 Or $80,000? Crypto Expert Predicts Where Price Is Headed Next</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-to-50000-or-80000/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-to-50000-or-80000/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。KSI预测比特币价格可能在未来的牛市周期中达到80,000美元，之后可能会出现回调至50,000-60,000美元。他认为夏季将是“无聊的红色夏季”，价格不会有所改善，但在冬季可能会再次走高。他预测比特币将在2025年初或者今年年底之前达到100,000美元。其他分析师也认为比特币可能在今年年底达到100,000美元甚至更高。 Rekt Capital也预测比特币将经历一段多月的重积累阶段，之后将迎来抛物线上涨。现在比特币正处于可能出现大幅度变化的加速周期中。 <div>
<p>Crypto expert popularly known as KSI has shared his thoughts on how the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-breaks-through-69000-setting-new-record/" rel="nofollow">Bitcoin price</a> could progress until the peak of this bull cycle. Based on his prediction, the flagship crypto could experience <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crash-10-69000/">significant dips</a> on its way to a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-100000-cardano-dead/#:~:text=Why%20Cardano%20Is%20Dead,non%2Dexistent%E2%80%9D%20on%20it.">new all-time high of $100,000</a>. </p>
<h2>$80,000 Could Be Next For Bitcoin</h2>
<p>KSI mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/ksicrypto/status/1771933873565282424?s=20" rel="nofollow">post</a> that Bitcoin could rise to between $73,000 and $80,000 from here. However, a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-new-ath-by-year-end/">correction could quickly follow</a>, as the crypto analyst remarked that Bitcoin would drop to between $50,000 and $60,000 afterwards. KSI added that it would be a “boring red summer,” suggesting that BTC&#8217;s price won’t be encouraging during that period. </p>

<p>KSI claimed that things would then pick up again in the winter. He also stated that Bitcoin could hit $100,000 by the beginning of 2025 or even before the end of this year. With his prediction, KSI joins a list of analysts who have predicted that Bitcoin could <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-analyst-sees-100k-before-halving/" rel="nofollow">hit the $100,000 mark</a> before the year runs out. </p>
<p>Tom Dunleavy, Partner and Chief Investment Officer (CIO) at MV Capital, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-100000-cardano-dead/#:~:text=Why%20Cardano%20Is%20Dead,non%2Dexistent%E2%80%9D%20on%20it.">previously stated</a> that BTC would rise to that price level this year. Meanwhile, Standard Chartered <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/mark-your-calendars-bitcoin-to-hit-100000-by-end-of-2024-standard-chartered-says/">initially predicted </a>that Bitcoin would hit $100,000 by year-end before taking a more bullish stance and predicting that the flagship crypto would hit $150,000 by the end of 2024. </p>
<h2>What To Expect From BTC&#8217;s Price</h2>
<p>KSI’s prediction also echoes the sentiments of crypto analyst Rekt Capital. In a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crash-10-69000/">recent analysis</a>, Rekt Capital mentioned that Bitcoin would enter a “multi-month re-accumulation” after the Bitcoin Halving, which could last up to five months. The crypto analyst noted that this period is usually characterized by Bitcoin’s tepid price movement. </p>

<p>Once that phase was over, Rekt Capital revealed that Bitcoin would break out from the re-accumulation area and make a parabolic move. This is said to be when BTC experiences “accelerated growth into a parabolic uptrend.” This phase lasts over a year, but Rekt Capital believes it may be cut in half in this <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bull-market-glassnode/" rel="nofollow">market cycle</a> with a “potential accelerated cycle occurring right now.”</p>
<p>The accelerated cycle he refers to includes the fact that BTC hit a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-breaks-through-69000-setting-new-record/" rel="nofollow">new all-time high (ATH)</a> before the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/why-bitcoin-halving-could-bring-uncertainty-to-mining-industry/#:~:text=The%20halving%2C%20which%20occurs%20approximately,reward%20for%20each%20validated%20block." rel="nofollow">Bitcoin Halving</a>. That has never happened in previous market cycles, raising the possibility of this bull market being largely different from past ones. </p>
<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $67,400, up over 4% in the last 24 hours according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/" rel="nofollow">data</a> from CoinMarketCap. </p>

<title>Bitcoin Top In Yet? What The Legendary MVRV Ratio Says</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-top-yet-legendary-mvrv-ratio-says/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-top-yet-legendary-mvrv-ratio-says/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章介绍了比特币市场价值到实现价值（MVRV）比率的最新趋势，说明了MVRV比率下降至2.34水平。文章解释了MVRV比率的定义和作用，以及如何解读该指标。图表显示了比特币MVRV比率的趋势，并指出高MVRV比率通常是价格顶部的标志。目前，比特币价格约为67200美元，上涨3%。文章分析了MVRV比率高值可能导致投资者利润回吐，进而影响市场的销售。 <div>
<p>Here&#8217;s what the latest trend in the Bitcoin Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio suggests about where the market is currently in terms of a top.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin MVRV Ratio Has Seen A Decline To The 2.34 Level</h2>
<p>According to data from the market intelligence platform <a href="https://twitter.com/intotheblock/status/1772191939544150204" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">IntoTheBlock</a>, the BTC MVRV ratio surged high earlier this year as the cryptocurrency rally took place.</p>
<p>The &#8220;<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-mvrv-ratio-approaches-1-5-break-happen/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">MVRV ratio</a>&#8221; is a popular indicator that tracks the ratio between the Bitcoin market cap and the realized cap. The former is simply the total valuation of the asset&#8217;s supply at the current spot price, while the latter is an on-chain capitalization model.</p>

<p>The realized cap measures the total sum of the value of the cryptocurrency&#8217;s supply, assuming that each coin in circulation has its true value at the price at which it was last transferred on the blockchain rather than the current spot value.</p>
<p>One way to interpret the realized cap is that since it takes into account the buying price of every token in circulation (assuming that the last transaction of every token was indeed the point at which it last changed hands), it essentially sums up the total capital the investors have invested in the asset.</p>
<p>As such, the MVRV ratio tells us how the total value that Bitcoin investors are carrying right now (that is, the market cap) compares against the value they put in (the realized cap).</p>
<p>Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin MVRV ratio over the past few years:</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin MVRV ratio" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="430" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GJgWV_XWsAEgwv-?format=jpg&amp;name=large" width="1696" /></p>

<p>As is visible in the graph, the Bitcoin MVRV ratio has had a value greater than 1 for a while now. When the indicator has such values, the market cap is greater than the realized cap, and hence, the investors carry net profits.</p>
<p>With the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/crypto-alameda-gap-bitcoin-rally/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">latest rally</a> in the asset, this indicator has surged to relatively high levels, a natural consequence of the holders&#8217; profits ballooning up with the price surge.</p>
<p>After the recent drawdown in the price, though, the MVRV ratio has also turned itself around, as it&#8217;s now heading down. At present, the ratio has a value of around 2.34.</p>
<p>&#8220;Traditionally, an MVRV ratio above 3 has been a reliable marker for predicting price peaks,&#8221; notes IntoTheBlock. So far, in the current rally, the metric hasn&#8217;t crossed this mark. It did come close recently, but the latest decline has meant it has gained a bit more distance to the level.</p>

<p>Why have tops historically occurred at high values of the Bitcoin MVRV ratio? The answer is that investors in profits are more likely to participate in selling, and this temptation to take profits only increases as their gains grow larger.</p>
<p>Because of this, selloffs are most probable when the market is holding extreme levels of profits, which is exactly what high MVRV ratio values reflect.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $67,200, up 3% over the past 24 hours.</p>

<title>Bitcoin is “Overheating” For The First Time Ever Before Halving</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-overheating-first-time-ever-before-halving/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-overheating-first-time-ever-before-halving/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。比特币价格在历史标准中出现偏离，并且在减半前首次进入“超买”区域。这表明比特币价格有望继续上涨。减半事件将减少矿工奖励，但目前的价格趋势显示出强劲的动能。价格已经超过了重要的动态水平，此外，技术指标也显示出向上的趋势。虽然目前价格在73000美元以下区间内震荡，一旦突破73800美元，将进一步促使需求增加。然而，需要谨慎对待，因为技术指标有时可能会误导。 <div>
<p>Bitcoin, the world&#8217;s most valuable coin, is once again deviating from historical norms. According to an <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/el_crypto_prof/status/1772198663504179682" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">analysis</a> by one crypto analyst, the coin is in the &#8220;overbought&#8221; territory of the Relative Strength Index (RSI) for the first time in the lead-up to halving. The RSI is a popular technical indicator analysts use to gauge the price momentum of traded instruments. </p>
<h2>Bitcoin Overheating? RSI Stands Above 70</h2>
<p>The analyst points out that the Bitcoin RSI on the monthly chart is currently above 70, indicating an overbought condition and overheating. This is a significant development as it&#8217;s the first time in Bitcoin&#8217;s history that this has happened before a halving. </p>
<img alt="BTC overheating | Source: Analyst on X" class="size-full wp-image-599584" height="526" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GJgdOS1WsAAqilC.jpg?resize=1024%2C526" width="1024" />
<p>The Bitcoin network is set to halve miner rewards in mid-April. This event, which occurs roughly every 200,000 blocks, will <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-halving-result-supply-squeeze-glassnode/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">cut rewards</a> distributed to miners by 50% from the current level of 6.125 BTC. Miners play a vital role in confirming transactions and maintaining network security. </p>

<p>The fact that Bitcoin prices appear to be &#8220;overheating&#8221; just before halving is net bullish for the coin. It suggests that prices are not only breaking from historical trends but also building strong momentum. </p>
<p>Besides the strong upside momentum, the analyst notes that Bitcoin now trades above a critical dynamic level on the monthly chart.</p>
<p>The confluence of these positive developments could explain why traders are upbeat. Most analysts agree that the coin will likely break higher in the weeks ahead, clearing the recent all-time high of around $73,800.</p>
<h2>BTC Pinned Below $73,000 And Consolidating </h2>
<p>Thus far, Bitcoin prices are firm, increasing as evident in the daily chart. After sharp contractions in the past few trading sessions, the welcomed reversal over the weekend lifted the coin towards the elusive $70,000 level and a previous all-time high.</p>
<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/x/2LgfhZs9/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="Bitcoin price trending upward on the daily chart | Source: BTCUSDT on Binance, TradingView" class="size-full" height="904" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/2LgfhZs9/" width="1787" /></a>
<p>However, judging from the candlestick arrangement in the daily chart, a break above $73,800 would likely catalyze more demand. So far, prices are moving sideways within a broad range despite signals of strength relayed from other indicators.</p>

<p>While some investors are bullish, expecting prices to rise, caution should prevail. A close above $74,000 would thrust Bitcoin into unchartered territory. Beyond this, the analyst uses technical indicators to make projections. These tools use historical parameters and lag. As such, they may not be as accurate and, thus, misleading in some instances.</p>

<title>7 Days Of Crypto: Key Events That You Should Keep An Eye On This Week</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/crypto/7-days-crypto-key-events/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/crypto/7-days-crypto-key-events/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。本周有一些重要事件可能会影响加密货币市场，包括联邦储备委员会官员的讲话和经济数据的发布。官员的讲话可能提供有关经济状况和利率走向的重要见解。此外，经济数据的发布将为市场提供经济强度的信息。加密货币市场需要获得动力，去年由于基金的利润带来的影响而下降，这周观察基金的状况将对市场走势产生重要影响。 <div>
<p>There are a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-major-events/">couple of events</a> to watch out for this week, as they could prove pivotal in determining the future trajectory of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/gary-gensler-says-crypto-needs-disinfectant/" rel="nofollow">crypto market</a>. These events could provide some certainty to the market or cause <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-meme-coin-mania-breaks-records/" rel="nofollow">investors</a> to wait on the sidelines for more favorable market conditions. </p>
<h2>Events That Could Affect The Market This Week</h2>
<p>Some Federal Reserve officials <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/calendar.htm" rel="nofollow">are scheduled</a> to speak at different events this week. One of them is Governor Lisa Cook, who will give a lecture on March 25. Fed Chair Jerome Powell will also participate in a discussion at the Monetary Policy Conference on March 29. </p>

<p>Their speeches are significant as they could provide valuable insights into the current state of the economy and what to expect from the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/federal-reserve-launches-fednow-crypto-in-trouble/" rel="nofollow">Federal Reserve</a> regarding interest rates in its fight against inflation. <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-recovers-on-fed-hike/" rel="nofollow">Macroeconomic factors like interest rates</a> usually impact the crypto market and partly determine the sentiments among crypto traders.</p>
<p>The crypto market is usually bullish whenever the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/fed-decision-bitcoin-price/" rel="nofollow">Federal Reserve</a> adopts a dovish stance on whether or not to hike interest rates. Therefore, these officials sounding positive in their speeches could help boost investors’ confidence in the crypto market since they would be less worried about things on the macro side. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, several economic data will be released this week, including the Consumer Confidence and Consumer Sentiment data and the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index. These releases offer insights into the economy’s strength and guide the Fed in deciding on future interest rate decisions. </p>
<h2>Crypto Needs A Big Win This Week</h2>
<p>Stakeholders and investors in the industry will no doubt hope that the events lined up for this week will provide a momentum boost for the crypto market. Last week was one to forget as things cooled after weeks of seeing the flagship crypto, Bitcoin, and altcoins <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-breaks-through-69000-setting-new-record/" rel="nofollow">make significant runs</a>. This downward trend is believed to have been due to some external factors.</p>

<p>One of them is the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/back-to-back-negative-bitcoin-etf-flows/" rel="nofollow">net outflows</a> that the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-spot-etf-100-volume/" rel="nofollow">Spot Bitcoin ETFs</a> recorded throughout last week, with many investors taking profits from the various funds. These Bitcoin ETFs had previously seen an impressive <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etfs-record-2-2-billion-inflow-in-past-week/" rel="nofollow">amount of inflows</a> into them, which positively affected Bitcoin’s price. As such, a trend of outflows was also expected to influence Bitcoin’s price, although negatively. </p>
<p>These Spot Bitcoin ETFs will again be in the spotlight this week, with the crypto community waiting to see if the sentiments among the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-sheds-nearly-1-billion-in-grayscale-bitcoin-etf/" rel="nofollow">ETF investors</a> will change. A sustained trend of profit-taking this week could spark another decline in the crypto market. </p>

<title>Analyst Presents Top 10 Cryptos To Turn $5,000 Into $500,000 By 2025</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/analyst-top-10-crypto-turn-5000-into-500000/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。在推特上，加密分析师Cyclop预测了即将到来的最大的代币季。他强调了选择低市值加密货币的战略重要性，预计投资者可以在未来数年内获得50倍至100倍的回报。他列出了十个低市值项目的观察清单，包括区块链游戏、去中心化市场制造服务和区块链自动化工具。当时，他的首选项目BALLZ的价格为0.04231美元，比历史最高价下跌了近50%。 <div>
<p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/nobrainflip/status/1772020031276167221" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">thread</a> on X (formerly Twitter), the popular crypto analyst known as cyclop (@nobrainflip) delivered a bold forecast to his substantial following of 394,000. He proclaimed, &#8220;We are close to the biggest altseason in history. Everyone will make x50-x100 on their entire portfolio. $5k portfolio will be around $250k-$500k in 2025. All you need is to buy the right lowcaps.&#8221;</p>
<p>This assertion hinges on a strategic selection of low market capitalization cryptocurrencies, which, according to Cyclop, are poised for an exponential surge in value. Cyclop elucidates his strategy by detailing the liquidity flow typically observed during a bull market phase, a sequential process starting with Bitcoin (BTC) and cascading down to meme coins.</p>
<p>He explains, &#8220;Here is a typical bull run liquidity flow: 1: BTC pump 2: ETH pump 3: High cap alts pump 4: Low caps pump 5: Memecoin pump.&#8221; Importantly, he highlights that high cap memecoins have already experienced their growth phase, suggesting that &#8220;lowcap/lowcap memecoins &#8211; next&#8221; are primed for significant value appreciation.</p>

<p>Within this framework, Cyclop underscores the potential for staggering returns without the necessity for professional day trading expertise. &#8220;It&#8217;s cause each coin has its maximum, and if its MC is already high, it&#8217;s not so far away. But when the market cap is almost at zero, the potential is enormous,&#8221; he advises, promoting a hands-off investment strategy focused on the &#8216;right&#8217; coins.</p>
<h2>Crypto Watchlist: Top-10 Lowcap Coins</h2>
<p>Cyclop&#8217;s watchlist is a selection of ten recently launched projects with low market caps and, in his view, substantial growth potential:</p>
<p><strong>#1 Wolf Wif (BALLZ):</strong> A meme coin that took the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solanas-memecoin-bonk-reaches-1-6-billion-market-cap-witnesses-explosive-100-price-rally/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Solana blockchain</a> by storm, achieving a $75 million market cap within a day of its launch. Despite a subsequent correction, Cyclop views this as an optimal entry point, confidently stating, &#8220;I&#8217;m holding my BALLZ tight.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>#2 Entangle (NGL):</strong> Positioned as a potential leading messaging infrastructure for the Web3 space, Entangle aims to enhance liquidity within the ecosystem. It offers secure, flexible, and interoperable solutions for blockchain data communication, positioning itself as a critical infrastructure for dApps and builders.</p>
<p><strong>#3 StarHeroes (STAR):</strong> This esports-centric, multiplayer third-person space shooter game is making waves with its dynamic and competitive gameplay. Cyclop sees this as a revolutionary blend of gaming and blockchain technology, offering intense gaming emotions and a new avenue for esports within the crypto realm.</p>
<p><strong>#4 Heroes of Mavia (MAVIA):</strong> A blockchain strategy game that allows players to build bases, engage in battles for cryptocurrency rewards, and form partnerships with landowners. Cyclop highlights its potential in the play-to-earn space, marking it as a standout project.</p>
<p><strong>#5 VoluMint (VMINT):</strong> This project introduces a decentralized, AI-driven market-making service, aiming to redefine market-making in the era of blockchain. Cyclop is bullish on its ability to unlock the potential of crypto projects, emphasizing its innovative approach.</p>
<p><strong>#6 SatoshiVM (SAVM):</strong> As a decentralized Bitcoin <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/matic-analysis/polygon-zkevm-successfully-completes-first-major-upgrade-introduces-dragonfruit/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">ZK Rollup</a> Layer 2 solution, SatoshiVM bridges the gap between Bitcoin and Ethereum&#8217;s EVM, using BTC as gas. This project aims to combine the value and security of Bitcoin with the programmability of Ethereum, creating a powerful ecosystem for decentralized applications. Cyclop notes, &#8220;SAVM&#8217;s unique positioning as a bridge between BTC and EVM ecosystems presents a groundbreaking opportunity for growth.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>#7 Graphlinq Chain (GLQ):</strong> Offering a no-code interface for automating blockchain tasks, Graphlinq Chain simplifies the creation and deployment of blockchain automations. Its suite of tools, including an IDE, App, Engine, and Marketplace, is designed to make blockchain automation accessible to a wider audience. &#8220;GraphLinq Protocol demystifies blockchain automation, paving the way for innovative applications and efficiencies,&#8221; Cyclop remarks.</p>
<p><strong>#8 zKML (ZKML):</strong> This project addresses the pressing need for privacy in digital transactions and communications. By combining zero-knowledge proofs, homomorphic encryption, and multi-party computation (MPC), zKML offers a secure and private framework for blockchain interactions. &#8220;ZKML&#8217;s focus on privacy-enhancing technologies is timely and critical, offering a secure haven for digital transactions,&#8221; observes Cyclop.</p>
<p><strong>#9 Monai (MONAI):</strong> Monai stands out for its development of uncensored generative AI tools, integrated with its blockchain, Monad. It features an advanced, unrestricted Large Language Model as its flagship product, aiming to revolutionize the way we interact with AI. &#8220;Monai&#8217;s pioneering approach to generative <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/top-ai-trend-coins-this-bull-run/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">AI within the blockchain space</a> is a game-changer, offering unparalleled possibilities,&#8221; Cyclop asserts.</p>
<p><strong>#10 EMC Protocol (EMC):</strong> Dedicated to AI applications, EMC Protocol is a blockchain network that includes a computing power consensus mechanism. It aims to facilitate the execution of AI tasks within a decentralized framework, including validator, smart router, and computing power nodes. &#8220;EMC&#8217;s innovative approach to integrating AI and blockchain could redefine the landscape of decentralized applications,&#8221; Cyclop concludes.</p>
<p>At press time, cyclop&#8217;s top pick &#8211; BALLZ &#8211; traded at $0.04231, down almost 50% from its alltime-high.</p>
<img alt="BALLZ price" class="wp-image-599551 size-full" height="1673" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BALLZUSDT_2024-03-25_13-06-26.png?resize=3628%2C1673" width="3628" />

<title>To Infinity And Beyond: Analyst Forecasts Bitcoin To Hit $100,000 In High-Speed</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章中指出，加密货币专家Doctor Profit认为比特币价格可能会迅速突破100,000美元，因为市场正处于重要阶段。他强调了比特币近期表现的重要元素，并预测了其未来的发展趋势。此外，文章还提到了比特币价格的技术分析和心理分析，以及比特币在经历阻力测试后可能迎来的超级循环。Doctor Profit建议投资者保持信心，等待即将到来的上涨行情。 <div>
<p>Cryptocurrency expert and analyst Doctor Profit has identified regions that are vital for <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/press-releases/bitcoin-recovery-will-ignite-massive-crypto-rally/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> presently, which could possibly propel the crypto asset&#8217;s price to unprecedented heights at a very fast pace.</p>
<p>For the most part, the cryptocurrency community is concerned about the way that Bitcoin&#8217;s price has performed during the last week. Nonetheless, Doctor Profit&#8217;s <a href="https://x.com/DrProfitCrypto/status/1771938758209794501?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">latest weekly update</a> on the crypto market and Bitcoin has provided optimism for investors within the crypto space.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin For A Massive Leg Up To $100,000</h2>
<p>In his analysis, Doctor Profit explores the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), psychological analysis, and technical analysis (TA) of Bitcoin&#8217;s recent performance. </p>
<p>Drawing attention to the previous Sunday report, the analyst predicted a sideways movement for Bitcoin in the longer term. However, the largest cryptocurrency asset is currently moving in the indicated sideways region, as he points out.</p>

<p>The expert claims that some people are unable to see the wider picture playing out within the sideways movement. Due to this, they fail to understand that price fluctuations in the 20% range are normal and even beneficial for moves in big market caps. </p>
<p>Thus, Bitcoin is preparing for its next big move, which will push prices over $80,000 and hit $100,000 at high speed. He noted that this bullish sideways movement is referred to as an accumulation area in trading terminology. </p>
<img alt="Bitcoin" class="size-medium wp-image-599562" height="234" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Doctor-Profits-Bitcoin-Chart.jpg?w=460&#038;resize=460%2C234" width="460" />
<p>During this stage, a convergence of profit-taking, incoming investment, and undecided money, practically leads to a mid-term consolidation. Consequently, he is bullish about the sideways trend and anticipates a looming upward surge. </p>
<p>Furthermore, Doctor Profit underscored the significance of Bitcoin&#8217;s recent breakout above its previous <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-blasts-past-70000-in-wild-week-to-register-new-all-time-high/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">all-time high (ATH)</a> of $69,000, and the necessity of exercising patience as the coin consolidates close to its peak level.</p>
<p>He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>What many fail to understand is that Bitcoin just broke through its all-time high (ATH) in the last few weeks and is now slowly building support near the ATH region. People don&#8217;t realize that this is a process that takes weeks.</p></blockquote>
<p>Doctor Profit asserts that before continuing to rise and entering the super cycle, the market would spend weeks in the area of the Golden Bull. &#8220;After confirmation at $72,500, it won&#8217;t be long until BTC rises <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-jumps-68k/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">beyond $70,000</a> and enters the super cycle,&#8221; he added.</p>
<h2>Recent Retest Pattern Aligns With Past Trends</h2>
<p>Doctor Profit seems to be pleased with Bitcoin retesting its previous ATH level in the $60,000 range. He highlights the potential of Bitcoin and the slow transformation of the $60,000 resistance level into a solid support point, paving the way for the upcoming super cycle similar to other ATH breakouts.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bitcoin now appears mature enough to withstand this pressure at $60,000 and maintain its above-average price without any difficulty,&#8221; he stated. Despite ongoing corrections, the analyst has urged investors to be confident, citing the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-halving-retrace-investors/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin Halving</a> as a catalyst for an impending upward surge.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Whales Remove A Staggering $2.3 Billion From Exchanges, Is It Time To Buy?</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-whales-2-3-billion/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-whales-2-3-billion/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。最近的数据显示，比特币鲸鱼持有者正在积极地收集比特币，将大量的加密货币从交易所转移到私人钱包。这种积累模式表明价格可能会在不久的将来出现增长。此外，大量比特币离开交易所，进入私人钱包，继续支持积极的市场情绪。分析师指出这种积累趋势可能促使比特币的价格上升，并且市场观察者们都在关注这一情况。 <div>
<p>Bitcoin whales <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-long-term-holders-price-top-glassnode/">have been very active</a> in the past few days as the crypto continues to trade below $68,000. Notably, on-chain data has shown a trend of accumulation among Bitcoin whales, with large bouts of the cryptocurrency leaving crypto exchanges into private wallets.  These massive transfers appear to have piqued the interest of a few investors who are keeping a watchful eye, as this accumulation pattern points to a price increase up ahead. </p>
<p>According to various posts by whale transaction tracker Whale Alerts, Bitcoin whales have recently transferred $2.3 billion worth of BTC in a span of 24 hours, indicating their bullish sentiment. Similarly, crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently revealed that over 25,000 BTC worth approximately $1.60 billion had been transferred into accumulation addresses.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Whale Accumulation Signal Price Surge Ahead</h2>
<p>Bitcoin has largely <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-rejects-68k/">traded below $69,000</a> since March 15, struggling to regain the momentum that saw it <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/breaking-news-ticker/breaking-bitcoin-hits-new-all-time-high-surging-past-70000-for-the-first-time-in-history/">shooting past $70,000</a> earlier in the month. Interestingly, Bitcoin fell to as low as $61,766 last week, representing a 16% decline from its all-time high. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Spot Bitcoin ETFs <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-etfs-bleed-for-one-week-straight-can-price-recover-to-73000/">saw consistent outflows</a> throughout the week which was spearheaded by Grayscale&#8217;s GBTC and weak inflows into BlackRock&#8217;s IBIT and Fidelity&#8217;s FBTC. This decline became much of a concern for investors as it signaled the bullish sentiment surrounding BTC <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-etf-netflows-may-experience-rebound-if-this-price-is-attained-analyst-explains/">might finally be coming to an end.</a></p>
<p>However, on-chain data is now telling a different tale of a strong bullish sentiment from Bitcoin whales. Data from Whale Alerts show large amounts of BTC leaving crypto exchanges, one of which was a transfer of 8,136 BTC worth $517 million <a href="https://x.com/whale_alert/status/1771242694016192637?s=20" rel="nofollow">from Coinbase</a> into a new private wallet. Shortly after, 8,172 BTC worth $519 million <a href="https://x.com/whale_alert/status/1771242697359073284?s=20" rel="nofollow">were transferred from Coinbase</a> into another new private wallet. Interestingly, the different alerts from the whale tracker added up to $2.3 billion worth of BTC to and from crypto exchanges on March 22. </p>
<p>Analyst Ali Martinez noted that these transfers added up to $1.6 billion being added into accumulation addresses, the largest inflow so far this year. </p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Yesterday, over 25,000 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">#Bitcoin</a>, valued at approximately $1.60 billion, were transferred to accumulation addresses, marking the highest inflow to these <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">$BTC</a> wallets so far this year! <a href="https://t.co/mAIHkG9ROC" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/mAIHkG9ROC</a></p>

<p>According to <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/asset/btc/chart/exchange-flows/exchange-reserve?exchange=all_exchange&amp;window=DAY&amp;sma=0&amp;ema=0&amp;priceScale=log&amp;metricScale=linear&amp;chartStyle=line" rel="nofollow">CryptoQuant data</a>, this accumulation trend has seen the Bitcoin reserves on exchanges on a downtrend since March 21. At the time of writing, the Bitcoin exchange reserve is at 1.98 million BTC. </p>

<p>Basically, whale accumulation tends to swing the balance into bullish among other traders. Fundamentals surrounding Bitcoin like the upcoming halving point to price growth in the near future, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-new-ath-by-year-end/">making it an ideal time</a> for investors to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/buy-much-bitcoin-as-you-can/" rel="nofollow">position themselves</a> in the market. </p>
<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $67,478. A key price level to watch is $69,000. If Bitcoin breaks above this resistance level, it <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-upside-break-68k/">could continue surging higher</a> with the accumulation trend.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Retests Resistance: Here’s The Level A Break Could Lead To</title>

<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-retests-resistance-level-break-lead/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />数据显示比特币目前正在重测一个重要的链上阻力水平，突破该水平可能导致价格激增。根据分析师Ali在X上指出，如果BTC能突破目前的阻力壁垒，可能会看到价格上涨至72,900美元水平。通过Glassnode的URPD指标图表显示，66,990美元水平周围的分区拥有大量比特币供应，此为当前BTC正在重新测试的范围。如果BTC能突破66,990美元水平，可能会继续向72,880美元水平上涨。当前BTC价格已经达到67,200美元水平，若价格持续上涨，资产将突破当前阻力区块。 <div>
<p>Data shows Bitcoin is currently retesting a major on-chain resistance level, and a break above which can potentially lead to a surge in its price.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Has Major On-Chain Resistance Around $67,000</h2>
<p>As pointed out by analyst Ali in a <a href="https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1771966295744893213" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, BTC may be able to see a rise towards the $72,900 level if the asset can break the current <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/all-clear-40000-bitcoin-little-on-chain-resistance/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">on-chain resistance</a> barrier.</p>

<p>In on-chain analysis, any level&#8217;s potential to act as support or resistance is measured using the amount of Bitcoin that was acquired/bought by the investors around said level.</p>
<p>The analyst has shared the chart for the &#8220;<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-plunges-64000-on-chain-support/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">UTXO Realized Price Distribution</a>&#8221; (URPD) indicator from Glassnode, that reveals how the various levels around the current spot value of BTC are looking like right now based on the density of supply that was last bought at them.</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin URPD" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="1298" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GJdJwuOW0AAi7P-?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096" width="2416" /></p>

<p>The URPD here is &#8220;ATH partitioned,&#8221; which means that the price ranges here are defined by dividing the levels between zero and the current all-time high (ATH) into 100 equal partitions.</p>
<p>From the chart, it&#8217;s visible that the partition around the $66,990 level carries the cost basis of a notable amount of the supply right now (1.3%). This also happens to be the range BTC is retesting at the moment.</p>
<p>Generally, the cost basis is a special level for investors, and thus, they tend to be more likely to show some reaction when a retest takes place. If a large number of holders share their cost basis inside the same narrow range, then this reaction may result in a scale that could be relevant for the market.</p>
<p>As for what direction this reaction from the holders would be probable to happen depends on the side the retest is happening from. A retest from under (meaning that these holders had been in loss prior to the retest) could lead to a selling reaction in the market.</p>
<p>This is because these investors may not want to risk the cryptocurrency declining again in the future, so exiting while they have the opportunity to at their break-even might be tempting.</p>

<p>As such, retests like these can lead to the asset feeling some degree of resistance. In the current case, the range is notably filled up with coins, so it&#8217;s possible that the strength of this resistance would be just as powerful.</p>
<p>From the chart, it&#8217;s visible that after this range, the asset potentially faces no strong on-chain resistance barriers until the $72,879 level, which hosts the cost basis of about 1.61% of the supply. &#8220;If Bitcoin can break past $66,990, it will likely rise toward $72,880!&#8221; says Ali.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>Bitcoin has been <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-upside-break-68k/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">climbing up</a> in the past day, with its price now reaching the $67,200 level. Should this surge be sustained, the asset would be through the current resistance block.</p>

<title>Social Media Storm Gives Dogecoin 14% Price Boost – Details</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/dogecoin-2/social-media-storm-gives-dogecoin-14-price-boost-details/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/dogecoin-2/social-media-storm-gives-dogecoin-14-price-boost-details/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要: 这些信息是积极的。 Dogecoin (DOGE)的社交媒体活动激增，与价格上涨超过14%的走势相吻合。Coinbase Derivatives申请引入与莱特币和比特币现金一起的美国监管期货合约，促进机构采用。4月在过去的几年中一直是DOGE的一个强劲月份，暗示着未来几周可能出现价格上涨。然而，技术指标显示出一些潜在的警告信号，暗示可能会出现短期价格回调。 <div>
<p>Dogecoin (DOGE), the meme-inspired cryptocurrency, has experienced a rollercoaster ride in recent days. A surge in social media activity surrounding the coin coincided with a price increase of over 14% within the last week. However, technical indicators hint at a potential pullback, leaving investors to grapple with mixed signals.</p>

<h2><strong>Social Media Frenzy Fuels Optimism</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://lunarcrush.com/categories/cryptocurrencies?metric=alt_rank&amp;filter=meme&amp;cols=alt_rank%2Cinteractions_24h%2Cclose%2Cpercent_change_24h%2Caverage_sentiment%2Ctop_influencers%2Cmarket_cap%2Cvolume_24h%2Clast_7_days&amp;rpp=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Data from LunarCrush,</a> a crypto analytics platform, revealed a significant uptick in social media interactions related to<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> DOGE</a>. Likes, comments, retweets, and upvotes on various platforms reached a staggering 30 million within a 24-hour period. This surge in social volume not only placed DOGE at the forefront of meme coin discussions but also suggests renewed investor interest.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-599519" height="283" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_1d8be2.png?resize=1024%2C283" width="1024" /></p>
<h2><strong>Regulatory Integration Paves The Way For Institutional Adoption</strong></h2>
<p>Adding fuel to the fire, Coinbase Derivatives recently filed with the CFTC to introduce US-regulated futures contracts for <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">DOGE,</a> alongside Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash. This regulatory move signifies a growing acceptance of established cryptocurrencies beyond the realm of traditional financial institutions. Integration with established players could lead to greater market stability and wider adoption for DOGE.</p>
<strong>April: Historically A Bullish Month For Dogecoin?</strong>
<p>The report also highlights a historical trend – April has proven to be a particularly strong month for DOGE in previous years. This historical data injects a dose of optimism into the current scenario, hinting at a potential price upswing in the coming weeks. However, past performance doesn&#8217;t guarantee future results, and investors should be cautious about relying solely on historical trends.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/D2u5R3fD/" width="1835" /></p>

<strong>Technical Indicators Flash Caution</strong>
<p>Despite the positive social media sentiment and historical precedent, technical indicators paint a somewhat contrasting picture. The Aroon Up Line, an indicator that gauges trend strength, suggests a weakening uptrend for DOGE. Additionally, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) – a measure of money flow – currently displays a negative value, indicating potential selling pressure.</p>

<strong>Dogecoin Bearish Signals </strong>
<p>The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator, often used to identify trend changes, further reinforces the bearish sentiment. Readings show the MACD line crossing below the signal line in mid-March, potentially marking the beginning of a short-term downtrend.</p>

<p>Lastly, the Parabolic SAR indicator, which identifies potential trend reversals, positions its dotted lines above the current DOGE price, suggesting increased selling activity.</p>
<strong>Navigating The Uncertain Waters</strong>
<p>The current situation surrounding DOGE presents a complex scenario with both positive and negative factors at play. While social media buzz and regulatory progress offer reasons for optimism, technical indicators warn of a potential short-term price correction.</p>

<title>Why Is The Price Of LUNC And USTC Up Today?</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/price-of-lunc-ustc-up-today/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/price-of-lunc-ustc-up-today/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章报道了Terra区块链创始人Do Kwon在蒙特内哥罗被释放的消息。尽管他被以虚假旅行文件入狱，但现已获释并被限制居家监禁。他的释放导致了LUNC和USTC两个加密货币价格的上涨。市场数据显示，两者在一天内均有显著增长，显示了继续上涨的趋势。目前，LUNC以0.0001672美元交易，24小时涨幅9.4%，USTC以0.0303美元交易，24小时涨幅5.39%。 <div>
<p class="p2">The <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/terra-luna/terra-classic-burns-lunc-ustc/">prices of LUNC and USTC</a> have both seen a considerable boost in the past day. But although there has been a bit of a recovery in the crypto market, another reason entirely is behind this surge in price and it has everything to do with the currently incarcerated founder of the Terra blockchain, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/do-kwon-what-happened-to-the-terra-luna-founder/">Do Kwon</a>.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Terra Founder Gets Released</h2>
<p class="p2">Do Kwon, the founder of the billion-dollar Terra blockchain, which collapsed in 2022, has been in prison in Montenegro for months now after being apprehended with fake travel documents. Since then, there have been numerous efforts by both the United States and South Korean governments to get the founder extradited for prosecution in their respective countries to no avail.</p>

<p class="p2">Between the two countries vying for extradition, there have been <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/montenegro-orders-do-kwon-extradition-to-s-korea/" rel="nofollow">reports that the Montenegrin court is leaning toward extraditing him to South Korea</a> to face charges for the collapse of the blockchain. Despite this, the founder remains in Montenegro as a final decision on his extradition has yet to be made.</p>
<p class="p2">While the courts deliberate on where to send the founder, Do Kwon has finally secured a release from prison in Montenegro. According to the release reports, Do Kwon is expected to remain in the country until the courts decide his fate.</p>
<p class="p2">Prison Chief Darko Vukcevic <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/do-kwon-released-from-prison-remanded-to-montenegro/" rel="nofollow">confirmed Do Kwon’s release</a> from prison as he says that the disgraced founder has <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/terra-luna/terraform-labs-appoints-new-ceo/">served the entirety of his sentence</a> for the fake travel documents. He was reportedly released on Saturday, March 23, and is currently under house arrest.</p>
<h2 class="p2">LUNC And USTC React To Do Kwon’s Release</h2>
<p class="p2">The prices of USTC and LUNC have reacted positively to the news of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/do-kwon-what-happened-to-the-terra-luna-founder/">Do Kwon</a> getting released on Saturday. After the news made the round, the prices of both altcoins saw a significant uptick, turning green despite the crypto market continuing to struggle.</p>

<p class="p2">The <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/lunc/lunc-price-rally-is-far-from-over-following-falling-wedge-breakout-analyst-says/">LUNC price</a> saw an over 10% jump from its Sunday lows of $0.00015, reaching as high as $0.000172 before correcting back downward. In the same vein, the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/lunc/ustc-lunc-to-1/">USTC price</a> also recorded a 10% increase during this time, going from $0.028 to peak at $0.031.</p>
<p class="p2">So far, both <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/lunc/lunc-price-rally-is-far-from-over-following-falling-wedge-breakout-analyst-says/">altcoins</a> have been able to maintain their gains in the last day, which could signal a continuation in the uptrend. Right now, there is not much resistance for both assets and if <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-etfs-bleed-for-one-week-straight-can-price-recover-to-73000/">Bitcoin</a> continues to rise, then both USTC and LUNC are expected to follow.</p>
<p class="p2">At the time of writing, LUNC is trading at $0.0001672 with a 24-hour gain of 9.4%, and USTC is trading at $0.0303 with a 24-hour gain of 5.39%, according to data from Coinmarketcap.</p>

<title>Bitcoin ‘Real Pump’ Nears New All-Time Highs, Analyst Says</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-real-pump-nears-new-all-time-highs-analyst-says/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是正面的。文章讨论了比特币在2024年的价格走势。一方认为比特币将迎来新高，达到超过$150,000的水平，支持理由包括机构投资增加、监管逐渐明晰和公众对数字资产的接受程度提高。另一方则认为比特币可能面临价格下跌，技术分析显示当前处于整固期，可能导致价格进一步下滑。无论如何，两种观点都承认未来几个月比特币价格可能会发生重大波动。 <div>
<p>Bitcoin, the ever-enigmatic digital currency, has analysts locked in a heated debate about its 2024 price trajectory. Will it soar to new heights, fueled by institutional adoption and mainstream acceptance, or will it face a reality check and revisit recent lows?</p>

<h2><strong>Bullish Vs. Bearish Perspectives On Bitcoin</strong></h2>
<p>The optimists, led by the prominent crypto analyst Cryptoyoddha, paint a picture of a bullish future. They point to a meticulously tracked historical chart showcasing the cyclical price movements of <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bitcoin.</a></p>
<p>Each cycle, Cryptoyoddha argues, follows a similar pattern: a period of accumulation followed by a parabolic surge. This analysis paves the way for the highly anticipated &#8220;Cycle IV,&#8221; which could propel Bitcoin beyond its current all-time high of $73,750 and potentially reach a staggering $150,000 or even higher.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">#Bitcoin</a></p>
<p>The real pump will start after the halving next month. <a href="https://t.co/eV5FWkzkxX" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/eV5FWkzkxX</a></p>
<p>— Yoddha (@CryptoYoddha) <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoYoddha/status/1771430384401842522?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">March 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>But what&#8217;s driving this bullish sentiment? Cryptoyoddha cites several factors: a surge in institutional investment, a shift towards clearer regulations for cryptocurrencies, and a growing public embrace of digital assets. These trends, coupled with the historical pattern of each cycle surpassing the previous one, paint a compelling picture for Bitcoin bulls.</p>
<p>However, not everyone is buying into the euphoria. Michaël van de Poppe, a renowned cryptocurrency trader, injects a dose of caution with his technical analysis. Studying charts that map Bitcoin&#8217;s price movements, van de Poppe detects a potentially bearish pattern following the recent price dip.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">#Bitcoin</a> eventually takes the liquidity below the lows.</p>
<p>Consolidation, low volatility. <a href="https://t.co/CincO9DFjD" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/CincO9DFjD</a></p>
<p>— Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1771460957992100191?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">March 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>He interprets the ongoing period of consolidation – where the price fluctuates within a narrow range – as a potential precursor to a further price drop. This drop, he suggests, could see Bitcoin revisit and even break below its recent lows.</p>
<p>Van de Poppe&#8217;s analysis focuses on the presence of &#8220;support&#8221; and &#8220;resistance&#8221; levels on his charts. These levels represent price points where historical buying and selling activity has been concentrated. If Bitcoin falls below a key support level, it could trigger a wave of panic selling, pushing the price further down.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/JV1wrqsf/" width="1835" /></p>

<h2><strong>Volatility And Uncertainty</strong></h2>
<p>The contrasting viewpoints highlight the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market. Bitcoin&#8217;s price is constantly influenced by a complex web of factors, including unforeseen regulatory decisions, security breaches, and broader economic trends. While historical cycles can offer valuable insights, they are not crystal balls that guarantee future performance.</p>
<p>Investors also need to be wary of placing blind faith in technical analysis. The market is not a purely mechanical system, and unpredictable events can disrupt even the most meticulously drawn charts.</p>

<p>Despite the differing predictions, both analysts acknowledge the likelihood of significant price movement in the coming months. Cryptoyoddha&#8217;s bullish outlook hinges on a fundamental shift in the cryptocurrency landscape, while van de Poppe&#8217;s technical analysis suggests a potential short-term price correction.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the fate of Bitcoin&#8217;s price in 2024 remains a mystery. The upcoming Bitcoin halving in April – an event that cuts the number of new Bitcoins entering circulation and has historically coincided with price increases – adds another layer of intrigue.</p>

<title>What is Macro/Crypto Summer? Don’t Miss Out, Says Expert</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/what-is-macro-crypto-summer-dont-miss-out-says-expert/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/what-is-macro-crypto-summer-dont-miss-out-says-expert/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。Raoul Pal提出了“Macro/Crypto Summer”概念，强调了宏观经济周期对加密货币市场的重要性。他解释了在这一阶段发生的一系列经济事件，并指出过去加密货币市场在此期间的巨大增长。他预测了未来几个月全球金融系统中液体性的提高，并提到了美国等国可能加入注入流动性的行列。Pal的投资策略以及对“一切代码”理论的洞察力使他准备好迎接Macro Summer的到来，并专注于Altcoin市场和所谓的“Banana Zone”。BTC目前的交易价格为67003美元。 <div>
<p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/RaoulGMI/status/1772039605501481191" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">thread</a> on X (formerly Twitter), Raoul Pal, a renowned trading guru and the founder/CEO of Global Macro Investor and Real Vision, has illuminated the crypto community about the advent of what he terms as the &#8220;Macro/Crypto Summer.&#8221; This period, according to Pal, is not just a fleeting season but a significant phase in the financial and cryptocurrency markets, deeply rooted in the cyclical nature of the global economy.</p>
<h2>Why The Macro/Crypto Summer Matters</h2>
<p>Pal elaborates on the concept of the &#8220;Macro Summer,&#8221; explaining it as a pivotal phase in &#8220;The Everything Code&#8221; cycle, closely following the Financial Conditions Index, which historically precedes the cycle by approximately ten months. The ISM (Institute for Supply Management) index, a key indicator of economic health, often bottoms out during this period, marking the start of GDP growth.</p>

<p>Pal&#8217;s thesis draws attention to the &#8220;near-perfect <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/where-are-we-in-this-bitcoin-cycle/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">3 1/2 year cyclicality</a>&#8221; in the ISM business cycle, propelled by liquidity dynamics and the debt refinancing cycle at its core. He underscores the significance of liquidity: &#8220;And that is driven by liquidity, which bottomed at the end of 2022&#8230; macro summer and fall are all about liquidity rising and is a core part of The Everything Code thesis.&#8221;</p>
<img alt="Macro crypto summer " class="wp-image-599486 size-full" height="1058" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GJeI2IWXoAAWFZg.jpg?resize=1770%2C1058" width="1770" />
<p>This<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-to-over-200000-in-less-than-5-months/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> influx of liquidity</a> is crucial for tech stocks, which historically thrive during these phases. Yet, it&#8217;s Bitcoin and, more broadly, the cryptocurrency market that exhibit the most dramatic responses. Pal presents staggering growth figures from past Macro Summer and Fall seasons to underscore his point:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bitcoin:</strong> Saw increases of &#8220;2012/2013: +146x, 2016/2017: +30x, 2020/2021: +8x&#8230;&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Ethereum:</strong> As an altcoin during the 2016/2017 and 2020/2021 cycles, it achieved &#8220;2016/2017: +1,770x, 2020/2021: +41x.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Altcoins (excluding ETH):</strong> Witnessed an aggregate market cap rise of &#8220;+24x&#8221; in the last cycle.</li>
</ul>
<img alt="Bitcoin summer" class="wp-image-599487 size-full" height="1082" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GJeJJzBWsAIQDM5-1.jpg?resize=1518%2C1082" width="1518" />
<p>“Wild! When we just look at Altcoins ex-ETH (we only have shorter data for the last cycle), the entire market cap rose +24x! And that includes thousands of worthless tokens that didn’t rise, so I’m not just cherry-picking winners here,” Pal remarked.</p>
<img alt="Altcoin summer" class="wp-image-599491 size-full" height="823" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GJeJnFdWoAA6z0C-1.jpg?resize=1413%2C823" width="1413" />
<p>DOGE, a popular meme coin, is mentioned by the expert as another prime example of the &#8220;power of Crypto Summer and Fall,&#8221; with its value experiencing significant multipliers &#8211; &#8220;2016/2017: +136x, 2020/2021: +370x” &#8211; in the aforementioned cycles.</p>
<p>These figures underline the significant influence of macroeconomic cycles on crypto valuations, with Pal pointing out the alignment of these cycles with <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/when-is-the-next-btc-halving-date-bitcoin-halving-guide/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin&#8217;s halving events</a>. &#8220;Crypto summer has started and fully develops post-halving,&#8221; he states, highlighting the interconnectedness of these cycles with the broader financial landscape.</p>

<p>Notably, Pal&#8217;s analysis doesn&#8217;t stop at the past; it looks forward, suggesting that liquidity is expected to rise all the way into the end of 2025. This anticipation is rooted in a complex interplay of global financial mechanisms, including the potential for increased US money printing in response to a massive ramp-up in interest payments and changes in Fed Net Liquidity and the Treasury General Account (TGA).</p>
<p>“Will the US join the summer party? [&#8230;] I know it seems impossible now, but the US is on the verge of a massive ramp-up in interest payments. [&#8230;] at some point – the balance sheet will stop shrinking, which is enough to unleash liquidity into the system. [&#8230;] I cannot see how they don’t massively expand liquidity, one way or another.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Pal predicts that it won’t be just the US injecting liquidity into the financial systems in the coming months. “I&#8217;ve no idea whether it&#8217;s China, the EU, Japan or the US that drives this or maybe a bit of all. Time will tell,” he remarked.</p>
<img alt="GMI total liquidity index" class="wp-image-599488 size-full" height="1212" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GJeKjx2XsAA6Pgj-1.jpg?resize=1552%2C1212" width="1552" />

<title>Shiba Inu Takes Over The Internet: Google Searches Climb As Global Interest Surges</title>

<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-takes-over-the-internet-google-searches-climb-as-global-interest-surges/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。Shiba Inu（SHIB）作为“Dogecoin Killer”再次受到关注，搜索热度和代币价格均出现上涨。SHIB价格在过去一个月飙升180%，达到两年高位，并计划推出Shibarium以吸引更多用户。全球范围内对SHIB的兴趣增加，搜索热度在全球多个国家均有增长。尽管市场出现调整，但Shiba Inu社区的热情依然高涨。整体而言，Shiba Inu在追逐其长期价格目标的路上取得了积极的进展。 <div>
<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB), the self-proclaimed &#8220;Dogecoin Killer,&#8221; is back in the spotlight with a surge in both search interest and token price. <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=now%207-d&amp;q=shiba%20inu&amp;hl=en" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Google Trends data</a> reveals a global increase in searches for &#8220;Shiba Inu&#8221; and related queries, indicating renewed investor optimism for the meme coin.</p>

<h2><strong>Shiba Inu Surge Sparks Enthusiasm</strong></h2>
<p>This increase comes after a quiet period for <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the memecoin.</a> However, the past month has been nothing short of phenomenal. Search popularity reached a seven-day peak of 100 on March 16th, though it has settled at a still-healthy 48 – significantly higher than January&#8217;s levels. Phrases like &#8220;Why is Shiba Inu going up?&#8221; and &#8220;Shiba Inu All-Time High&#8221; have also seen a significant uptick, reflecting investor curiosity and potential buying interest.</p>
<p>While the interest is global, specific regions are leading the charge. Pakistan, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Canada, and Nigeria have emerged as the top search originators for SHIB in the past week. This geographically diverse interest suggests a broad-based appeal for the meme coin.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-599457" height="431" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_31f050.png?resize=1024%2C431" width="1024" /></p>

<p>This renewed interest coincides with a remarkable price rally. SHIB&#8217;s value has skyrocketed over 180% in the past month, reaching a two-year high of $0.000045. This bullish run fueled speculation of a retest of its all-time high above $0.000088. However, the market has since witnessed a correction, bringing SHIB&#8217;s price down slightly.</p>
<p>Despite the correction, the enthusiasm within the Shiba Inu community remains high. The long-term goal of reaching $0.01 per SHIB token continues to be a hot topic, although analysts caution it might take several years to materialize.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/dKY3gBRm/" width="1835" /></p>

<h2><strong>Shibarium And Market Recovery</strong></h2>
<p>To achieve this ambitious target, the developers are focusing on Shibarium, the project&#8217;s Layer-2 scaling solution. Shibarium aims to become a thriving smart contract hub, potentially attracting more users and driving up demand for SHIB.</p>
<p>Experts believe several factors are contributing to the current Shiba Inu frenzy. The broader cryptocurrency market has shown signs of recovery after a recent slump, potentially boosting investor confidence in meme coins like SHIB.</p>
<p>Additionally, ongoing developments within the Shiba Inu ecosystem, such as Shibarium and the burning initiatives to reduce the overall token supply, might be fueling investor optimism.</p>

<p>Whether SHIB can maintain its current momentum and reach its long-term price goals remains to be seen. However, the recent surge in search interest and price rally is a clear indication that the &#8220;Dogecoin Killer&#8221; is back in the game, attempting to capture the hearts (and wallets) of memecoin enthusiasts worldwide.</p>

<title>STX Brushes Off Sluggish Crypto Market As It Shoots Up By 30%</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章提到了STX代币在市场放缓的情况下仍然保持着强劲增长。即将到来的四月被视为STX的重要月份，因为即将举行的内部活动使生态系统充满活力。此外，与其他区块链项目建立的合作关系也为STX带来了增长动力。尽管短期内可能会有熊市压力，但该代币目前仍站稳脚跟。 <div>
<p>With a broader slowdown in the broader market, some altcoins continue to push forward with minimal resistance; STX is one of those, with the token <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/stacks" rel="nofollow">up</a> nearly 30% in the weekly timeframe. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="nofollow">market</a>, as of the moment, is up less than a percent. This movement is minute compared to the huge swings noted in the last few months. However, Stacks’s internal growth goes against the slowing trend in the market. </p>
<h2><strong>April Prospects Grow by The Day</strong></h2>
<p>Next month is expected to be the biggest month for STX as internal developments sweep across the ecosystem. The official Stacks X account recently <a href="https://x.com/Stacks/status/1771334385754653131?s=20" rel="nofollow">posted</a> about the ecosystem’s recent wins. Most notable of these is the <a href="https://stackssnacks.com/p/franklin-templeton-highlights-nakamoto-release-velar-amm-mainnet" rel="nofollow">feature</a> done by digital asset investment firm Frank Templeton on Stacks’s upcoming Nakamoto Upgrade. </p>

<p>On Velar’s Dharma Automated Market Maker (AMM), the stSTX/aeUSDC pair has been <a href="https://x.com/VelarBTC/status/1771144863540547625?s=20" rel="nofollow">added</a>, giving investors more staking options on Velar’s platform. This development might’ve had an effect on the growth of StackingDAO which recently <a href="https://defillama.com/protocol/stackingdao" rel="nofollow">breached</a> the $100 million mark. This means investor confidence in Stacks is gradually growing, grabbing the attention of people who are hesitant about DeFi on the Bitcoin blockchain. </p>
<p>Another confidence booster for investors is the <a href="https://x.com/Bifrost_Network/status/1771175375135261177?s=20" rel="nofollow">announced</a> partnership of Xlink, Bifrost, and ALEX Labs to bridge Stacks with other blockchains outside the realm of Bitcoin DeFi. </p>
<p>“Our collaboration with XLink and ALEX represents a significant step towards achieving true interoperability across blockchain networks, including that of Stacks and Bifrost. We are proud to contribute our capabilities to this partnership, unlocking new possibilities for BTC enthusiasts,” Dohyun Park, founder of the Bifrost Foundation, said in a statement on Bifrost’s official blog <a href="https://bifrost.medium.com/bifrost-network-xlink-and-alex-lab-collaboration-announced-b34e7717e473" rel="nofollow">post</a> about the partnership. </p>
<p>These events singlehandedly helped STX gain ground against the bears in the short to medium term. But with April at the corner, can the token stand on solid ground? </p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/C9YNZysj/" width="1835" /></p>

<h2><b>Bears Might Gain Ground In The Coming Days</b></h2>
<p>STX’s recent price movements have attracted investors with the fear of missing out on previous gains. In the short to medium term, we might see STX slow down to a halt, following the broader market trend. </p>

<p>At the moment, the fresh breach on $3.28 might be able to hold any bearishness once bulls solidify their current position above this price level. If they fail to do this, however, we might see a fall towards $2.91 before the start of April.</p>

<title>Ethereum Price Could Regain Strength If It Clears This Key Hurdle</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-strength-3580/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-strength-3580/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。以太坊价格正试图突破 $3,400 区域展开新的上涨周期，并保持在 $3,250 支撑以上。随着突破关键的下降趋势线和 $3,400 阻力，ETH 目前交易在 $3,400 上方，以及 100 小时简单移动平均线。若价格能站稳 $3,500 阻力区，可能继续上涨，目标将是 $3,550 和 $3,580，之后有望测试 $3,720 和 $3,880 阻力。然而，未能突破 $3,500 可能导致下跌，并测试 $3,250 和 $3,060 支撑位。 <div>
<p><em>Ethereum price is attempting a fresh increase wave above the $3,400 zone. ETH must clear the $3,580 resistance to continue higher in the near term.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Ethereum is holding gains above the $3,250 support zone.</li>
<li>The price is trading above $3,400 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.</li>
<li>There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $3,400 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).</li>
<li>The pair could continue to rise if it settles above the $3,500 resistance zone.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ethereum Price Eyes Fresh Increase</h2>
<p>Ethereum price remained stable above the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-signals-uptrend-3580/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">$3,250 support zone</a>. ETH formed a base and started a fresh increase above the $3,350 resistance level, like <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-upside-break-68k/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin</a>.</p>
<p>ETH climbed above the $3,400 resistance zone. There was a move above the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,587 swing high to the $3,250 low. There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $3,400 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.</p>
<p>Ethereum is now trading above $3,400 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $3,500 level. It is near the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $3,587 swing high to the $3,250 low.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Ethereum_a53be6.png?resize=1024%2C449"><img alt="Ethereum Price" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-599449" height="449" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Ethereum_a53be6.png?resize=1024%2C449" width="1024" /></a></p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ETHUSD/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ETHUSD on TradingView.com</a></p>
<p>The first major resistance is near the $3,550 level. The next key resistance sits at $3,580, above which the price might gain bullish momentum. In the stated case, Ether could rally toward the $3,720 level. If there is a move above the $3,720 resistance, Ethereum could even climb toward the $3,880 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of $4,000.</p>
<h2>Another Decline In ETH?</h2>
<p>If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,500 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,400 level.</p>
<p>The first major support is near the $3,250 zone. The next key support could be the $3,060 zone. A clear move below the $3,060 support might send the price toward $3,000. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,880 level.</p>
<p>Technical Indicators</p>
<p>Hourly MACD<strong> – </strong>The MACD for ETH/USD is gaining momentum in the bullish zone.</p>
<p>Hourly RSI<strong> &#8211; </strong>The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 level.</p>
<p>Major Support Level – $3,400</p>

<title>Bitcoin ETFs Bleed For One Week Straight – Can Price Recover To $73,000?</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-etfs-bleed-for-one-week-straight-can-price-recover-to-73000/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-etfs-bleed-for-one-week-straight-can-price-recover-to-73000/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。文章报道了上周Spot Bitcoin ETFs连续遭遇净流出，反映机构交易者的看涨情绪可能在减弱。与此同时，Grayscale的GBTC也创下了史上最大单日赎回记录。尽管交易量仍然可观，但流入仍然疲弱。现在关键问题是比特币能否恢复并重返最近高于73000美元的历史新高。未来几天对于比特币价格的走势至关重要。 <div>
<p>Last week was rough for Spot Bitcoin ETFs as they failed to attract strong inflows day after day. As a result, these Spot Bitcoin ETFs witnessed consecutive daily outflows every day last week, indicating the bullish sentiment among institutional traders might actually be waning. This seems to have been reflected in the price of Bitcoin, as the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-rejects-68k/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">cryptocurrency fell to as low</a> as $61,370 during the week. </p>

<h2><b>Bitcoin ETFs See Sustained Outflows</b></h2>
<p>Investor interest in Spot bitcoin ETFs <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-new-ath-by-year-end/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">skyrocketed throughout February</a> and early March amid Bitcoin&#8217;s bull run, pushing its price to an<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/breaking-news-ticker/breaking-bitcoin-hits-new-all-time-high-surging-past-70000-for-the-first-time-in-history/"> all-time high</a> of $73,737. </p>
<p>This maximum investor interest saw the ETFs setting new trading records for exchange-traded funds in the US. However, these ETFs have now set a negative record of five consecutive days of outflows to <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-spot-etf-outflows/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">beat a four-day outflow streak</a> set in January.</p>
<p>According to data from BitMEX Research, these ETFs witnessed five days of consecutive outflows of $154.4 million, $326.2 million, $261.6 million, $93.1 million, and $51.6 million. At the same time, Grayscale&#8217;s GBTC set a new record for the most daily outflow. </p>
<p>BitMEX also reveals that the world&#8217;s largest crypto asset manager saw redemptions of 9,539.7 BTC worth over $642.5 million on Monday, the largest single-day outflow in GBTC&#8217;s history.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">[1/4] Bitcoin ETF Flow &#8211; 22 March 2024</p>
<p>All data in. 5th day of net outflows. $52m total net outflow for the day. Blackrock with a record low inflow of $18.9m <a href="https://t.co/63u297xh8d" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/63u297xh8d</a></p>
<p>— BitMEX Research (@BitMEXResearch) <a href="https://twitter.com/BitMEXResearch/status/1771465855680823612?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">March 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Grayscale&#8217;s outflow wasn&#8217;t particularly surprising, considering that the fund has witnessed consistent daily outflow since its launch. The surprise came from very weak inflow into other Spot ETFs like BlackRock (IBIT) and Fidelity (FBTC), whose huge inflows have always offset outflows from GBTC. </p>
<p>Particularly noteworthy is the fact that Blackrock (IBIT), which has consistently been the target of the majority of inflow, established a new inflow low of $18.9 million on Friday, March 22. Fidelity, on the other hand, also saw its inflow fall to as low as $5.9 million on Monday, March 18.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/nnxo1w7H/" width="1835" /></p>

<h2><b>Can Bitcoin Price Recover?</b></h2>
<p>The big question now is whether Bitcoin can stage a strong recovery and reclaim its recent all-time high above $73,000. A <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-pre-halving-btc-rally-us-fed-decision/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">continuation of outflows</a> from Spot Bitcoin ETFs could further weigh on Bitcoin price. </p>
<p>Interestingly, the weak inflow hasn&#8217;t really related to low trading activity, as trading volume remained significant throughout the week. <a href="https://www.theblock.co/data/crypto-markets/bitcoin-etf/cumulative-spot-bitcoin-etf-volumes" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Data </a>shows that the cumulative trading volume of the 10 ETFs is now at $164 billion after witnessing $22.71 billion in trading volume last week.</p>

<p>After a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-long-term-holders-price-top-glassnode/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">week of deep outflows</a>, the coming days will be crucial in determining the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-etf-netflows-may-experience-rebound-if-this-price-is-attained-analyst-explains/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">next major move</a> in the price of Bitcoin. Despite the rough week, Bitcoin still <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/buy-much-bitcoin-as-you-can/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">has a chance to rebound</a> back to $73,000 or higher, especially with the approach of the next <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-halving-result-supply-squeeze-glassnode/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin halving event</a>. </p>

<title>Eyes On Toncoin: Speculation Rises After 40% Weekly Surge – What Comes Next?</title>

<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/eyes-on-toncoin-speculation-rises-after-40-weekly-surge-what-comes-next/</guid>

<div> 摘要：<br /><br />这些信息是积极的。Toncoin (TON)在过去24小时内暴涨，过去一周涨幅达40％，与Ton基金会的Open League计划的推出相吻合，该计划旨在激励用户和项目参与TON区块链。技术分析显示TON呈现出强劲的上升趋势，加上CoinCodex的预测显示TON在未来五天有望增长30％。然而，市场波动性和监管变化可能影响TON的价格和发展。 <div>
<p>Toncoin (TON) has been on a hot streak, surging double digits in the past 24 hours and boasting a 40% gain in the last week. This bullish run coincides with the launch of the Ton Foundation&#8217;s Open League initiative, a program designed to incentivize user and project participation on the TON blockchain.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">The price currently sits at $4.96</a>, having reached a new cycle high of $5.28 on March 23rd. This surge comes amidst a broader market downturn for major cryptocurrencies, making TON a standout performer.</p>

<h2><strong>TON&#8217;s Open League Sparks Bullish Momentum</strong></h2>
<p>The Open League, announced on March 20th, promises to distribute a hefty 30 million TON tokens (roughly $115 million) to participants. This sizeable reward pool has ignited excitement within the TON community, attracting new projects and users to the network. But can this momentum be sustained? Analysts are cautiously optimistic.</p>
<p>Technical analysis paints a promising picture for TON. The Awesome Oscillator, a tool measuring market trends and momentum, displays a series of green bars, indicating a rise in bullish sentiment.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) – a gauge of buying and selling pressure – has trended upwards, suggesting a healthy inflow of liquidity.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/L51Hnzvc/" width="1835" /></p>

<p>Adding to the optimism, crypto prediction platform CoinCodex forecasts a price of $6.45 for TON by March 29th, translating to a potential 30% increase within the next five days. Toncoin&#8217;s medium-term outlook also appears strong, with a 120% gain observed in the last quarter.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-599413" height="341" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_ea098e.png?resize=1024%2C341" width="1024" /></p>

<h2><strong>Toncoin: Bullish Momentum Analysis</strong></h2>
<p>However, despite the positive indicators, cryptocurrency markets are known for their volatility. While the Open League undoubtedly injects excitement into the TON ecosystem, it&#8217;s crucial to acknowledge the possibility of a price correction.</p>
<p>The current RSI and MFI readings could be interpreted as nearing overbought territory, potentially signaling a temporary pullback.</p>

<p>Investors should delve deeper before making any investment decisions. The broader cryptocurrency market can significantly impact TON&#8217;s price. A sustained downturn in the industry could dampen TON&#8217;s rally.</p>
<p>Additionally, the long-term viability of TON hinges on the success of its ongoing development projects. Evaluating the roadmap and progress can provide valuable insights.</p>
<p>Finally, staying informed about potential regulatory changes within the cryptocurrency space is crucial, as they could impact TON&#8217;s adoption and price.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Addresses Add $1.6 Billion In BTC In A Single Day – Price Recovery Soon?</title>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。最近一周比特币价格下跌引起了加密货币社区的关注，但一些投资者正将此视为买入机会。最新的链上数据显示，有一类投资者在积极购买比特币，超过25,000 BTC流入积累地址。这表明大额玩家在长期投资的角度看好比特币，也暗示了短期内价格可能会看涨。虽然比特币目前价格略有上涨，但仍比上周下跌了2.4%。然而，对比特币来说，三月是一个总体表现良好的月份。 <div>
<p>The price performance of Bitcoin over the past week has been a source of concern for the majority of the crypto community. This has pretty much been the case for other cryptocurrencies in the market, with several large-cap tokens reversing their recently-accrued profits.</p>
<p>However, some investors are treating the recent price decline as <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-etf-netflows-may-experience-rebound-if-this-price-is-attained-analyst-explains/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">a rare opportunity in the bull market</a> as they continue to load their bags with assets of their choice. Specifically, the latest on-chain data shows significant buying activity amongst a certain class of investors. </p>
<h2>25,000 BTC Flow Into Accumulation Addresses In One Day</h2>
<p>Prominent crypto pundit Ali Martinez revealed, via a <a href="https://x.com/ali_charts/status/1771477802707034192?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post on X</a>, that more than 25,000 BTC (valued at approximately $1.6 billion) was moved to accumulation addresses on Friday, March 22. This figure represents the highest amount transferred to these wallets in a single day so far in 2023.</p>

<p>The metric of interest here is the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/large-players-are-in-full-bitcoin-accumulation-mode-as-on-chain-activity-grows/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Inflow to Accumulation Addresses</a> on the Bitcoin blockchain. For context, a Bitcoin accumulation address refers to an address that has zero outgoing transactions and maintains a balance of at least 10 BTC.</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin " class="aligncenter wp-image-599365 size-large" height="542" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GJWNJQbXEAAAYT_.jpeg?w=860&#038;resize=860%2C542" width="860" /></p>

<p>This classification, however, excludes digital wallets linked to centralized exchanges and miners and has less than 2 non-dust incoming transfers. Also, it doesn&#8217;t include addresses that have not seen any activity in more than seven years.</p>
<p>The increased flow of coins into this class of wallet addresses is evidence of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-usdt-tether-8888-btc/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">substantial BTC accumulation</a> by entities who view the crypto as a long-term investment. It signals that certain big-money players are amassing Bitcoin in anticipation of potential value appreciation.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, this significant <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-long-term-holders-price-top-glassnode/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">acquisition by long-term investors</a> emphasizes the increasing adoption of Bitcoin as a store of value. Meanwhile, it might be an indicator of bullish price movement in the short term. </p>
<h2>Bitcoin Price Overview</h2>
<p>As of this writing, Bitcoin is <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-new-ath-by-year-end/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">valued at $64,636</a>, reflecting a mere 1% price increase in the past 24 hours. This price change is somewhat negligible, considering the deep retracement of the premier cryptocurrency earlier in the week.</p>
<p>According to data from CoinGecko, the price of BTC is down by 2.4% over the past week. Meanwhile, the market leader is currently about 13% from its record high of $73,798.</p>

<p>However, it has been an overall positive performance for the Bitcoin price in March, having surpassed this previous all-time high of $69,000 a little over a week ago. And, with a market cap of $1.26 trillion, BTC retains its position as the largest cryptocurrency in the sector.</p>

<title>Top Analyst’s Bold Prediction: XRP Set To Skyrocket 1,500%</title>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章讨论了有关瑞波（Ripple）的XRP加密货币未来表现的乐观预测，包括对其短期价格潜在爆发的看法。多位市场分析师认为XRP可能会在接下来的市场周期中迎来显着涨价，达到新的高点。然而，有分析师认为这些预测过于乐观，未来发展的关键因素尚未清楚，市场仍存在分歧。 <div>
<p>XRP, the native token of Ripple, is stirring up excitement in the crypto market with analysts predicting a potential short-term price explosion. However, the extent and timing of this surge remain a point of contention.</p>
<p>In a recent analysis of the cryptocurrency market, several market analysts have expressed optimism about the short-term prospects of XRP, the digital asset associated with Ripple. These analysts believe that XRP could experience a substantial increase in price, potentially reaching new heights before the peak of the current market cycle.</p>

<h2><strong>XRP Bold Predictions: Fact Or Folly?</strong></h2>
<p>Capt Toblerone, a prominent crypto analyst, recently ignited the discussion with a bold claim: XRP could see a staggering 15-fold increase (1500%) before the current bull market reaches its peak. This translates to a price target of roughly $10 by July 2024, a significant leap from its current price hovering around $0.62.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>— CAPT. PARA8OLIC TOBLERONE (@CaptToblerone) <a href="https://twitter.com/CaptToblerone/status/1758464702047223859?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">February 16, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Toblerone isn&#8217;t alone in his optimistic outlook. Analyst Jake Gagain believes a $5 price point for XRP is achievable in the near future, while crypto founder Nick envisions a more ambitious target of $10 by the cycle&#8217;s end. This bullish sentiment echoes the broader market expectation of a potential $5-$10 range for the altcoin.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZGRfWGUD/" width="1835" /></p>

<p>The underlying rationale for this bullishness hinges on XRP&#8217;s historical performance. Back in late 2017, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/xrp" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">XRP</a> witnessed a meteoric rise, culminating in its all-time high of $3.84. Analysts like Toblerone see parallels between the current market conditions and 2017, hoping for a similar price explosion.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Bullish 2025 Crypto Price Predictions. <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">$BTC</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ETH&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">$ETH</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SOL&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">$SOL</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24XRP&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">$XRP</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ADA&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">$ADA</a> <a href="https://t.co/xGQKZYRrpm" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/xGQKZYRrpm</a></p>

<p>However, a closer look reveals cracks in the bullish narrative. Toblerone&#8217;s previous prediction for Q2 2024 placed XRP within a range of $2.5-$11. With just ten days left in the quarter, achieving even the lower end of that prediction seems highly unlikely.</p>

<h2><strong>Analyzing The Divide</strong></h2>
<p>Furthermore, the article lacks any mention of concrete factors driving the anticipated surge. While past performance offers a glimpse into possibilities, it&#8217;s not a guarantee of future results. The cryptocurrency market thrives on innovation and adoption, and without evidence of significant developments for Ripple or XRP, the predicted price surge might be wishful thinking.</p>



<p>Not all analysts share Toblerone&#8217;s enthusiasm. Some, like Dark Defender and EGRAG, propose a more conservative range of $5-$17 for XRP in the coming weeks. This more measured approach acknowledges the inherent volatility of the crypto market and avoids relying solely on historical parallels.</p>
<p>The divided opinions highlight the importance of caution for investors considering XRP. While a price increase is certainly possible, the predicted 15x surge might be overly ambitious.</p>

<title>Incoming MATIC Surge: Analyst Predicts $15 Price Target</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/matic/incoming-matic-surge-analyst-predicts-15-price-target/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/matic/incoming-matic-surge-analyst-predicts-15-price-target/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />数字资产分析师Crypto Patel预测MATIC价格将迎来牛市。尽管过去一周MATIC表现疲软，但分析师表示正形成有利的牛市趋势图。他预测如果MATIC在高时段突破1.20美元价格水平，价格可能涨至10-15美元。此外，他认为即使市场发生崩溃，MATIC也将在0.60-0.70美元价位找到支撑。目前，MATIC交易价格约为0.9817美元，在过去24小时内涨幅为1.30%，市值达97亿美元，排名第16位。 <div>
<p>Digital asset analyst with X handle Crypto Patel has recently shared a bullish prediction on MATIC price movement in the coming weeks. This forecast comes amidst MATIC’s poor performance in the last seven days, during which it lost 6.68% of its market value, based on<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/polygon/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> data from CoinMarketCap. </a></p>
<p>The Polygon native token had been one of the best-performing assets in 2024 rising by over 76.38% between January to March. However, the altcoin has now recorded a 22.83% decline <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/matic/matic-price-slumps-10-amidst-market-downturn-here-are-key-levels-to-watch/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">over the last two weeks</a>, drawing much concern over its future price movement. </p>

<h2>$1.20 Price Level Critical For MATIC Price Surge, Analyst Says</h2>
<p>In a<a href="https://x.com/CryptoPatel/status/1771560468877836392?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> post on X on March 23,</a> Crypto Patel presented a bullish case for MATIC despite the token’s current downtrend, naming the forecast the “MATIC BULL RUN ROADMAP.”</p>
<p>Firstly, the analyst stated that a MATIC bullish pennant was being formed. For context, the bullish pennant represents a price pattern that typically follows a string of upward movement in price (the flagpole) followed by a period of consolidation (pennant).</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MATIC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">$MATIC</a> BULL RUN ROADMAP <img alt="🚀" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f680.png" style="height: 1em;" /></p>

2&#x20e3; 2021 Bull Run: Did 100x in Last bull Market After Bull Flag Breakout
3&#x20e3; If MATIC/USDT Break $1.20 Level in HTF then Ready for $10-$15 Target
4&#x20e3; I am Bullish in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/POLYGON?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">#POLYGON</a> for Long Run
5&#x20e3; If Market Crash then… <a href="https://t.co/FJEvGiHd4U" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/FJEvGiHd4U</a></p>
<p>— Crypto Patel (@CryptoPatel) <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoPatel/status/1771560468877836392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">March 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>A bullish pennant is characterized by converging trendlines, which indicates the continuation of the previous uptrend once the price breaks out of consolidation. Importantly, Crypto Patel emphasized that MATIC’s bullish pennant was being formed on a higher time frame (HTF), such as the weekly chart. </p>
<p>Following historical trends, the complete formation of the bullish pennant could result in Polygon native asset experiencing a 100x price increase in the highly anticipated crypto bull run, as observed in 2021.</p>
<p>However, with a focus on short-term targets, Crypto Patel has stated that MATIC reaching the $1.20 price zone on the HTF could trigger a surge to a range of $10-$15, representing a potential 1500% gain on the asset’s current price.  Albeit, in the advent of an unexpected crash, the crypto analyst expects MATIC could be significantly affected but should find support around the $0.60-$0.70 price zone. </p>

<h2>MATIC Price Overview</h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">At the time of writing, MATIC trades around $0.9817 with a 1.30% gain in the last 24 hours. Meanwhile, the token’s daily trading volume has declined by 31.82% and is valued at $291.65 million. With a market cap value of $9.7 billion, MATIC is ranked the 16th largest cryptocurrency and one of the world’s most prominent digital assets.</p>

<title>Ethereum Sees Notable Rise In Daily Activity, But Why Is Price Down?</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-sees-notable-rise-in-daily-activity-but-why-is-price-down/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-sees-notable-rise-in-daily-activity-but-why-is-price-down/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。最近以太坊网络的活跃用户和交易量有显着增长，但以太币（ETH）的价格在过去几天有所下跌。尽管大部分加密货币市场都受到影响，但以太坊活跃地址数量自1月3日以来增长了46%。 尽管ETH价格出现短暂突破4000美元后下跌，但网络活动持续增长。尽管以太坊价格受到压力，但目前价格在3280美元形成了一定支撑。 <div>
<p>Ethereum&#8217;s network has seen notable growth recently in both daily active users and daily transaction volume, yet the price of ETH, Ethereum&#8217;s native cryptocurrency, has <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-signals-uptrend-3580/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">undergone corrections</a> in the past few days. Notably, Ethereum is down by over 10% in the past seven days, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-long-term-holders-price-top-glassnode/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">underperforming Bitcoin</a> and the S&amp;P 500. </p>
<p>While <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-extends-losses-3200/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">this decline</a> can be felt through the majority of large cryptocurrencies in the industry, the number of daily active Ethereum addresses has been steadily rising over the past month. </p>

<h2><b>Ethereum&#8217;s Network Activity Surges But Price Remains Stagnant</b></h2>
<p>An increase in network activity is usually a bullish sign for the price of cryptocurrencies as more activity means more demand. Interestingly, the number of daily active Ethereum addresses has increased by over 46% since January 3. </p>
<p>This increase in active addresses largely came with a surge in price over the past few months. Ethereum shot up from $2,909 on February 24 to reach a two-year high of over $4,000 on March 12, representing a surge of over 39%. According to <a href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_daily_active_addresses" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">data from YCharts</a>, the number of daily active addresses increased simultaneously from 432,647 to 515,145 during the same time frame. </p>
<p>However, Ethereum has <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-bears-aim-3000/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">been on a price decline</a> since its brief cross over $4,000 and is currently down by 17% in the past 10 days. On the other hand, the network has witnessed a continued surge in activity in terms of on-chain data, with the number of daily active addresses now at 618407 in the past 24 hours, its highest point since October 2023. </p>
<p>According to data from IntoTheBlock, ETH&#8217;s daily average volume has been steadily growing in a similar manner to the one recorded in 2020&#8217;s early bull market. This growth has now pushed the amount of ETH transferred on Ethereum to its highest level since May 2022 this week.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/zBxVrPU2/" width="1835" /></p>

<h2><b>Can Ethereum Resume Its Uptrend?</b></h2>
<p>At the time of writing, Ethereum is trading at $3,355. The price of any cryptocurrency, including ETH, depends heavily on market sentiment and speculation. While growing adoption and network activity are positive signs for long-term price growth, speculation is what really drives the price, at least in the short term. </p>
<p>At the same time, its price remains under pressure from several areas. One of such pressures is a recent report that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/why-now-reasons-ethereum-probe-by-sec/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the SEC is poking around</a> Ethereum and the Ethereum Foundation and is looking to classify <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-foundation-receives-confidential-inquiry/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ETH as a security</a>. </p>
<p>As the second-largest cryptocurrency, ETH&#8217;s classification as a security <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-in-the-hot-seat-sec-security-label-looms/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">could cause chaos</a> that would eventually cascade into other crypto assets.</p>

<p>Ethereum seems to have now formed a minor support at the $3,280 price level. Failure to hold above this price point <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-signals-uptrend-3580/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">could mean</a> a further move to the downside.</p>

<title>March Sees Nearly $1 Billion In Ethereum Netflow To Centralized Exchanges – What’s Happening?</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/march-sees-nearly-1-billion-in-ethereum-netflow-to-centralized-exchanges-whats-happening/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。本文指出，尽管以强劲的开局开始，但随着月份的进行，以太坊未能完全实现其承诺。对于整个加密货币市场而言，这种熊市压力已经很普遍，而法规不确定性对ETH而言是一个额外的担忧，引发了围绕“替代币之王”的负面情绪。同时，最新的链上数据显示，到目前为止，在3月份大量的以太坊被转移到交易所，这表明投资者可能正在失去对以太坊的信心。 <div>
<p>The <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-signals-uptrend-3580/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">price of Ethereum</a> has not exactly lived up to its promise as the month has gone on, despite a stellar start to the month. While this bearish pressure has been widespread in the general cryptocurrency market, regulation uncertainty has been an additional concern for ETH, igniting a negative sentiment around the “king of altcoins.”</p>
<p>Interestingly, the latest on-chain revelation shows a substantial amount of Ethereum has made its way to exchanges so far in March, suggesting that investors might be losing confidence in the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/high-stakes-week-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum-as-central-bank-decisions-approach-key-predictions/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">long-term promise of the cryptocurrency</a>.</p>
<h2>Are Investors Losing Confidence In Ethereum?</h2>
<p>According to data from CryptoQuant, more than $913 million has been recorded in net ETH transfers to centralized exchanges so far in March. This on-chain information was revealed via a <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/65fd78fdc5dce70945d89a40-March-Sees-913M-USD-in-Net-ETH-Transfers-to-CEXs-%C2%BFSpurred-by-Regulatory-Turmoil?utm_source=telegram&amp;utm_medium=sns&amp;utm_campaign=quicktake&amp;utm_content=onchainschool" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">quicktake post</a> on the data analytics platform.</p>
<p>This net fund movement represents the largest volume of Ethereum transferred to centralized exchanges in a single month since June 2022. Even though March is still a week from being over, this exchange inflow appears to be a complete deviation from the pattern observed over the past few months.</p>

<p>As shown in the chart above, October 2023 was the last time cryptocurrency exchanges witnessed a positive net flow. It is worth noting that there was significant movement of Ethereum tokens out of the centralized platforms in subsequent months up until this month.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a separate data point that supports the massive exodus of ETH to centralized exchanges has come to light. Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez <a href="https://x.com/ali_charts/status/1771142679398613449?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">revealed on X</a> nearly 420,000 Ethereum tokens (equivalent to $1.47 billion) have been transferred to cryptocurrency exchanges in the past three weeks.</p>
<p>The flow of<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-whale-1000000-sol-binance-bearish/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> large amounts of cryptocurrency to centralized exchanges</a> is often considered a bearish sign, as it can be an indication that investors may be willing to sell their assets. Ultimately, this can put downward pressure on the cryptocurrency’s price.</p>
<p>Substantial fund movements to trading platforms could also represent a shift in investor sentiment. It could be a sign that investors are losing faith in a particular asset (ETH, in this case).</p>
<p>Moreover, the recent regulatory headwind surrounding Ethereum specifically accentuates this hypothesis.  According to the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-in-the-hot-seat-sec-security-label-looms/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">latest report</a>, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission is considering a probe to classify the ETH token as a security.</p>
<h2>ETH Price</h2>
<p>As of this writing, the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/altcoins-fall-ethereum-solana-surpass-expectations/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ethereum token</a> is valued at $3,343, reflecting a 4% price decline over the past /4 hours. According to data from CoinGecko, ETH is down by 11% in the past week.</p>

<title>Ethereum Drops Below The 100-Day Moving Average – What’s Next?</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-drops-below-the-100-day-moving-average-whats-next/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-drops-below-the-100-day-moving-average-whats-next/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。<br />以太坊价格下跌，目前低于100日移动平均线，RSI指标显示价格处于下降趋势，MACD指标也显示价格仍然看跌。支撑水平为$3,067，阻力水平为$3,681和$3,591。如果价格突破支撑水平，可能会继续下跌。如果价格反弹，可能会突破阻力水平并继续上涨。 <div>
<p>The crypto market is experiencing a pullback after <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/press-releases/bitcoin-recovery-will-ignite-massive-crypto-rally/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin</a>, the leading cryptocurrency, reached a new all-time high. However, Ethereum (ETH) is not left out in this downward move.</p>
<p>After setting a new yearly high of $4,094, the price of Ethereum has been moving downward and this has led to the price trading below the 100-day Moving Average (MA) both in the 1-hour and 4-hour timeframes, but this is not so in the daily timeframe. </p>
<p>Will the price continue downward or will it change direction and start moving upward? At the time of writing, Ethereum’s price was trading around $3,360 and was up by 0.64% in the last 24 hours.</p>
<h2>Ethereum Indicators And What They Suggest</h2>
<p>Looking at the chart, technically we can see that a support level of $3,067 and a resistance level of $3,681 and $3,591 have been formed respectively. Nonetheless, there could be more support and resistance created if the price continues to move downward.</p>
<p>4-Hour Moving Average: A technical observation of the chart from the 4-hour timeframe as seen in the image below reveals that the price is trending below the 100-day <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/ethereums-moving-averages-point-to-bullish-continuation-with-a-1000-target/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">moving average</a>. This suggests that the price is on a downtrend and could potentially move further downward.</p>
<p><img alt="Ethereum" class="size-medium wp-image-599333 aligncenter" height="273" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ETHUSDT_2024-03-23_11-57-27.png?w=460&#038;resize=460%2C273" width="460" /></p>
<p> 4-Hour RSI indicator: With the help of the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-momentum-reignites-2200/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Relative Strength Index indicator (RSI)</a> we can see the RSI signal line is trending below the 50 line. This is a strong indication that the price of Ethereum is in a downward trend as observed in the image above.</p>
<p>MACD Indicator: Taking a close look at the MACD indicator in the 4-hour timeframe, it appears that the MACD histogram has dropped below the zero line. In addition, both the MACD line and the signal line have crossed below the zero line. </p>
<p>This setup indicates that the price is still bearish and there are possibilities that it could still move downward. The image below provides more details:</p>
<p><img alt="Ethereum" class="size-medium wp-image-599334 aligncenter" height="256" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/ETHUSDT_2024-03-23_11-58-50.png?w=460&#038;resize=460%2C256" width="460" /></p>
<h2>Possible Outcome</h2>
<p>If the price of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-signals-uptrend-3580/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ethereum</a> continues downward and breaks below the support level of $3,067, it could move further downward to create a new support level. However, if the price fails to break below this support level, we could see a price reversal and may start a fresh trend upward. Thus there could be a possibility that the price could break above the resistance levels of $3,681 and $3,591 respectively, and continue its bullish run.</p>

<title>Bitcoin ETF Netflows May Experience Rebound If This Price Is Attained, Analyst Explains</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要: 这些信息是积极的。文章指出，随着比特币价格的下跌，现货比特币ETF市场近日显得相当黯淡。然而，分析师Ki Young Ju预测了现货比特币ETF市场可能出现的复苏迹象，并指出较低的$56,000价格可能是关键支撑水平。这表明新的比特币鲸鱼，尤其是ETF买家，通常在$56,000的平均价格购买比特币。根据历史数据，当比特币价格下跌时，ETF的需求通常会增加，因此可能会引发大规模的流入。 <div>
<p>In line with the decline in Bitcoin’s price, the spot Bitcoin ETF market has appeared rather gloomy in recent days. According to<a href="https://x.com/BitMEXResearch/status/1771106574699737363?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> data from analytics firm BitMEX Research</a>, these BTC ETFs have recorded a negative netflow for the<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-reclaims-66000-despite-4-day-etf-outflow-streak/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> last four trading sessions. </a></p>
<p>This situation has been marked by large levels of Grayscale’s GBTC outflows and the record low inflows for the other ETFs, mainly the market leaders BlackRock’s IBIT and Fidelity’s FBTC. However, amidst these persistent declining netflows, Ki Young Ju, a prominent analyst and Chief Executive Officer at Cryptoquant, has predicted a possible resurgence in the spot Bitcoin ETF market.</p>

<h2>Analyst Pinpoints $56,000 Level As Critical To Bitcoin ETF Recovery</h2>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/ki_young_ju/status/1771038205623865426?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X on March 22, Ki Young Ju shared that a rise in spot Bitcoin ETFs netflows could occur even as the BTC price decline continues. Using data from the historical netflow trends, the analyst noted that demand for Bitcoin ETFs usually kicks in when the cryptocurrency traces to certain support levels. </p>
<p>Young Ju stated that, in particular, new BTC whales, especially ETF buyers, have shown to have a $56,000 on-chain cost basis. This suggests that the new significant holders of Bitcoin, particularly those invested in ETFs, usually purchased Bitcoin at an average price of $56,000.  Following this trend, the crypto quant boss believes the spot Bitcoin ETF market could experience massive inflows if BTC reached the specified price level.
</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">#Bitcoin</a> spot ETF netflows are slowing.</p>
<p>Demand may rebound if the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">$BTC</a> price approaches critical support levels.</p>
<p>New whales, mainly ETF buyers, have a $56K on-chain cost basis. Corrections typically entail a max drawdown of around 30% in bull markets, with a max pain of $51K. <a href="https://t.co/vZCG4F0Gh5" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/vZCG4F0Gh5</a></p>
<p>— Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) <a href="https://twitter.com/ki_young_ju/status/1771038205623865426?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">March 22, 2024</a> </p></blockquote>
<p>For now, Bitcoin’s price has oscillated <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-rejects-68k/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">between $62,000 and $68,000,</a> as seen in the last week. However, Young Ju believes that such a descent is quite feasible as price corrections usually see a maximum decline of 30%. Using BTC&#8217;s most recent high of $73,750, the analyst predicts the asset price could still trade as low as $51,000. </p>

<h2>BTC Price Overview</h2>
<p>At press time, Bitcoin <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">continues</a> to trade at $64,065.74, representing a decline of 3.73% and 7.17% in the last one and seven days. Meanwhile, the asset’s daily trading volume is down 3.53% and valued at $39.62 billion. </p>
<p>Following historical trends of the bull cycle, it is possible that BTC may have reached its price peak leading up to the halving event in April. If that is the case, Bitcoin may likely not return to previous high price levels soon and could experience further price drops in the coming weeks.  </p>

<title>Bitcoin Long-Term Holders &amp; Price Top: Glassnode Reveals Pattern</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-long-term-holders-price-top-glassnode/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-long-term-holders-price-top-glassnode/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。Glassnode的报告指出，比特币长期持有者的分布模式通常会影响比特币潜在峰值。长期持有者最近增加了分配，这可能预示着市场变化。通过LTH市场通胀率指标，可以跟踪LTH的行为。历史数据显示，当LTH分布达到顶峰时，比特币价格往往会达到平衡甚至潜在顶峰。当前，LTH市场通胀率表明我们正处于分配周期的早期阶段。比特币价格目前下跌至63800美元。 <div>
<p>The on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has explained that Bitcoin tends to reach a potential top when the long-term holders show this pattern.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Have Been Ramping Up Distribution</h2>
<p>In a new report, <a href="https://insights.glassnode.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Glassnode</a> discussed the influence that the BTC long-term holders have on the cryptocurrency&#8217;s supply dynamics. The &#8220;long-term holders&#8221; (LTHs) here refer to the Bitcoin investors who have been holding onto their coins for more than 155 days.</p>
<p>The LTHs comprise one of the two main divisions of the BTC user base based on holding time, with the other cohort known as the &#8220;short-term holders&#8221; (STHs).</p>

<p>Historically, the LTHs have proven themselves to be the persistent hands of the market. They don&#8217;t quickly sell their coins regardless of what is happening in the broader sector. The STHs, on the other hand, often react to FUD and FOMO events.</p>
<p>As such, it&#8217;s not unusual to see the STHs participating in selling. However, the LTHs showing sustained distribution can be something to note, as selling from these HODLers, who usually sit tight, may have implications for the market.</p>
<p>There are many different ways of tracking the behavior of the LTHs, but in the context of the current discussion, Glassnode has used the &#8220;LTH Market Inflation Rate&#8221; metric.</p>
<p>As the report explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>It shows the annualized rate of Bitcoin accumulation or distribution by LTHs relative to daily miner issuance. This rate helps identify periods of net accumulation, where LTHs are effectively removing Bitcoin from the market, and periods of net distribution, where LTHs add to the market&#8217;s sell-side pressure.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the BTC LTH Market Inflation Rate over the past several years:</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin LTH Market Inflation Rate" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="1013" src="https://i0.wp.com/insights.glassnode.com/content/images/2024/03/glassnode-studio_bitcoin-long-term-holder-market-inflation-rate.png?resize=1800%2C1013&#038;ssl=1" width="1800" /></p>

<p>In the chart, the analytics firm has also attached the data for the asset&#8217;s Inflation Rate, which is basically the amount that the miners are introducing into the circulating supply by solving blocks and receiving <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/solo-bitcoin-miner-200000-reward/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">rewards</a> for them.</p>
<p>When the LTH Market Inflation Rate equals 0%, these HODLers are accumulating amounts exactly equal to what the miners are issuing.</p>
<p>This implies that the indicator below the 0% mark suggests the LTHs are pulling coins out of the supply, while it being above is a sign that they are either distributing or just not buying enough to absorb what the miners are producing.</p>
<p>The graph shows that historically, the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price has tended to reach a state of equilibrium and potentially even a top when the LTH distribution has peaked.</p>

<p>The LTH Market Inflation Rate has been increasing recently, but it&#8217;s yet to reach any significant levels. As for what this could mean for the market, Glassnode says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Currently, the trend in the LTH market inflation rate indicates we are in an early phase of a distribution cycle, with about 30% completed. This suggests significant activity ahead within the current cycle until we achieve a market equilibrium point from the supply and demand perspective and potential price tops.</p></blockquote>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>Bitcoin has retraced most of its recovery from the past few days, as its price has now declined to $63,800.</p>

<title>Dogecoin Whales Go On Massive Buying Spree, Here’s How Much They’ve Bought</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-whales-buying-spree/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-whales-buying-spree/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br /> Dogecoin在过去两天中活动逐渐上升，扭转了停滞期。DOGE过去24小时上涨了7%，逆转了过去一周的一些调整。一些Dogecoin鲸鱼一直在进行大规模的购买，据链上数据显示。一位知名加密货币分析师Ali Martinez在社交媒体上分享了这种积累趋势，指出DOGE鲸鱼在过去三天内购买了超过2500万DOGE，价值约375万美元。大部分的分析师认为DOGE在接近未来目标$1的同时，主要取决于鲸鱼地址的积极情绪，尤其是如果它们继续积累模式。<br /> <div>
<p>Dogecoin has seen a steady rise in activity in the past two days to reverse the period of stagnancy <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-growth-holder-activity/">recorded earlier in the week</a>. At the time of writing, DOGE is up by 7% in the past 24 hours, reversing some of the corrections it has experienced in the past week. Turns out some Dogecoin whales have been going on a massive buying spree, as indicated by on-chain data. </p>
<p>Popular crypto analyst Ali Martinez highlighted this accumulation trend by tweeting that DOGE whales have bought over 25 million DOGE worth around $3.75 million in the past three days. </p>
<h2>Crypto Analyst Reveals Dogecoin Whale Accumulation</h2>
<p>According to the Santiment chart shared by Ali Martinez on social media, wallets holding between 10 million to 100 million DOGE tokens have now pushed their total balance to 15.63 billion DOGE after adding 25 million DOGE in the past 24 hours. </p>


<p>Interestingly, the chart dynamics indicate this is a major change in sentiment from this cohort of traders, as their collective balance has been in a freefall since March 14th.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Dogecoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">#Dogecoin</a> whales have bought 25 million <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24DOGE&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">$DOGE</a> in the past 72 hours, worth around $3.75 million! <a href="https://t.co/y1RnRffWhv" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/y1RnRffWhv</a></p>
<p>— Ali (@ali_charts) <a href="https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1770798858718560581?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">March 21, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<h2>Why Does This Matter?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-whales-btc-exchanges/">Crypto whales</a> typically <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-whales-increase-their-holdings-by-3-billion-is-a-price-surge-imminent/">move the market</a>. Increased buying or <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-whales-cashing-out/">selloff from</a> a few large traders could change the sentiment of other investors, and they could further cascade a price surge or decline. Notably, the chart shared by Martinez shows that the total balance of DOGE&#8217;s whale addresses has largely corresponded with the price increase. </p>
<p>For example, the drop on March 14 in the total whale balance corresponded with a 33% drop in DOGE&#8217;s price from $0.1878 on March 14 to March 20. However, DOGE is now showing signs of recovery and is currently trading at $0.1629.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/doge/dogecoin-price-support-0-1220/">Dogecoin whales and FOMO buyers</a> may temporarily push DOGE higher, its long term success really depends on whether it can transform from a memecoin into a widely used cryptocurrency. Dogecoin <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-coinbase-futures-listing/" rel="nofollow">recently scored a point</a> in its bid to achieve mainstream adoption. Coinbase, America&#8217;s biggest crypto exchange, revealed plans to introduce Dogecoin along with Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash to its regulated futures contract offerings.</p>

<p>According to an <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/analyst-predicts-when-dogecoin-will-reach-1/" rel="nofollow">earlier prediction</a> by Ali Martinez, DOGE could reach the $1 mark in April. His prediction was based off of the crypto&#8217;s performance after similar breakouts in 2017 and 2021. </p>
<p>A large part of this prediction coming to manifestation is a bullish sentiment from whale addresses, especially if they continue on an accumulation pattern. A key price level to watch is $0.20. If DOGE breaks above this resistance level, it could continue surging higher on buying momentum. But if it fails to break $0.20 and starts dropping again, it may indicate the rally is running out of steam.</p>

<title>Floki Inu Roadmap Reveals Plans For Regulated Bank Accounts, FLOKI Faces 17% Downtrend</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/floki-inu-roadmap-reveals-plans-for-regulated-bank-accounts-floki-faces-17-downtrend/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/floki-inu-roadmap-reveals-plans-for-regulated-bank-accounts-floki-faces-17-downtrend/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。Floki Inu的开发团队发布了2024年的计划，包括推出受监管的数字银行账户，与Venus DeFi协议集成，推出Floki借记卡，以及即将发布的Valhalla主网。他们计划通过数字银行账户让更多人获得传统银行服务，推出Floki借记卡便于使用FLOKI代币进行消费，与Venus Core Pool整合提供更深的流动性，推出FLOKI驱动的交易机器人等。Floki代币近期价格有所下跌，但仍然实现了惊人的440%涨幅。 <div>
<p>The development team behind the dog-themed meme coin Floki Inu has unveiled its highly anticipated <a href="https://floki.medium.com/floki-roadmap-whats-next-on-our-agenda-3e957b56d277" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">roadmap </a>for 2024, revealing several upcoming features and utility-focused initiatives. </p>
<p>Notable highlights include the launch of regulated digital banking accounts, integration with the Venus decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, the Floki debit card&#8217;s introduction, and the Valhalla mainnet&#8217;s upcoming release.</p>
<h2>Floki Inu Aims To ‘Bank The Unbanked’</h2>
<p>Floki Inu plans to introduce regulated digital banking accounts, enabling users to create and fund bank accounts using <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/crypto-analysts-foresee-another-floki-expansion-despite-market-drop/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">FLOKI tokens</a>. </p>

<p>In partnership with an unnamed licensed fintech company operating in key jurisdictions such as Canada, Spain, Dominica, Australia, and the UAE, these accounts will support SWIFT payments and SEPA IBANs. </p>
<p>In addition, the upcoming launch of Floki Debit Cards will allow users to link their digital bank accounts to debit cards, providing a convenient and secure way to spend their FLOKI tokens in traditional currencies such as Euro (EUR) and US dollars (USD). </p>
<p>According to the proposal, the initiative aims to &#8220;bank the unbanked&#8221; by enabling a broader user base to access traditional banking services using their FLOKI tokens while increasing the utility and adoption of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/floki-skyrockets-to-new-all-time-high-soaring-60-following-two-major-listings/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">cryptocurrency</a>.</p>
<p>Pending governance approval, Floki Inu also seeks to list its native token, FLOKI, on the Venus Core Pool. This integration aims to unlock deeper liquidity, comparable to established <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/floki-grows-over-300-as-memecoin-breaches-400-million-tvl-details/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">blue-chip cryptocurrencies</a> and allow FLOKI holders to use their tokens as collateral to borrow various assets such as Maker (DAI), Circle&#8217;s USDC stablecoin, Binance Coin (BNB) and Ethereum (ETH). </p>
<p>By integrating Venus Markets directly into Floki&#8217;s user interface (UI), the protocol states that users will have frictionless access to the liquidity provided by the platform, further integrating Floki into the decentralized finance ecosystem.</p>
<h2>FLOKI-Powered Trading Bot And Valhalla Mainnet Launch</h2>
<p>Floki Inu plans to introduce a cross-chain Telegram and Discord trading bot powered by the FLOKI token. This bot will allow users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies on leading blockchain networks. Specifically, 50% of the fees generated will be used to buy and burn FLOKI tokens, increasing their utility and contributing to a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/who-let-the-doge-out-dog-themed-coins-soar-by-12-wif-and-floki-lead-the-way/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">deflationary mechanism</a>. </p>
<p>Finally, the highly anticipated mainnet release of Valhalla, Floki Inu&#8217;s flagship utility and metaverse game, will occur. Valhalla on the Mainnet will feature on-chain game mechanics, a PlayToEarn economy, upgradeable NFTs, and an open-world experience. </p>

<img alt="Floki Inu" class="size-large" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/IVK5JN6F/" width="1814" />
<p>As of this writing, the FLOKI token has experienced a correction of over 17% in the past seven days, aligning with the overall market trend. This correction has resulted in the current trading price of $0.0002295 for the FLOKI token.</p>
<p>Despite the recent downtrend, it is worth noting that FLOKI has still achieved a remarkable <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/floki-skyrockets-32-higher-following-dwf-labs-10-million-acquisition-plan/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">year-to-date</a> gain of 440%. This substantial increase in value has propelled the token&#8217;s market capitalization to $2 billion, solidifying its position at the 59th spot among the top 100 cryptocurrencies in the market.</p>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。一位加密货币交易者在三天内损失了超过100万美元，因为在FOMO购买时价格高不高销售更高。另外两位交易者也在购买'presale meta' memecoin时遭受了损失。这些交易者高买低卖，导致损失数百万美元。交易者纷纷因追逐下一个高飞的memecoin而蒙受巨大损失，即使这些项目并没有长期规划。 <div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Cryptocurrency traders constantly look for the next big project to yield significant profits. However, not all of their investments result in massive gains.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A recent report by Lookonchain revealed that a trader lost more than $1 million within three days.</p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">When Buying High Doesn’t Result In Selling Higher</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">According to the blockchain research platform Lookonchain, a crypto trader lost 6,039 SOL over the last three days after FOMO-buying a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/crypto-analyst-base-next-memecoin-hotspot-top-8/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">memecoin</a>. Per the report, the trader bought Slerf (SLERF) for 4,958 SOL, worth around $1 million.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The different transactions occurred when the price hovered between $0.8 and $1.4 on its launch day. A couple of hours later, the trader sold its SLERF tokens, losing 2,793 SOL after the token’s price plunged to the $0.4-$0.6 range, for a loss of $564,000.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Seemingly, the fear of missing out made the trader buy SLERF a second time when the price neared its all-time high (ATH) of $1.30. The address bought 3 million Slerf at $1.17, spending 19,133 SOL, worth around $3.152 million.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">At the time, the pending question was whether the trader would profit from this second attempt or lose more money. As Lookonchain reported, the FOMO buyer sold all their SLERF tokens at a loss again, losing 6,039 SOL, worth $1.15 million.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Slerf token, which has been all over the news for its <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana-memecoin-presale-gone-wrong-creator-accidentally-burns-10m-whale-makes-huge-profit/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">dramatic launch</a>, saw a significant price decrease of 52.39% from the ATH registered the day after launch. At writing time, SLERF is trading at $0.6351, an 18.4% decrease in the past 24 hours.</p>

<p></p>
<p>A second trader <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1769717744260554920" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">lost</a> 3,731 SOL, worth $775,000, just one hour after buying 790,236 SLERF at its ATH price. The trader then doubled down on its bet and bought another 650,000 SLERF. Unluckily, the token’s price plummeted after both purchases.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Is The Crypto Presale Meta Hand In Hand With FOMO?</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">To paint an even bigger picture, another crypto trader lost money yesterday after buying a different &#8216;presale meta&#8217; memecoin. Although the figures are more modest than the other two cases, this trader bought SMOLE and lost 371 SOL. Later, the address spent 2,549 SOL to buy SLERF.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">This guy always buys high and sells low. </p>

<p></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">SMOLE, despite only being out for one day, has already seen <a href="https://twitter.com/poorweb/status/1771072173232230797" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">massive criticism</a> and a 17.1% price drop. At writing time, the memecoin is changing hands at $0.0001499, a 70.39% decrease from its highest price of $0.0005086.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As this might suggest, FOMO seemingly drives memecoin traders’ decisions during this presale meta. The trend has seen hundreds of millions of dollars <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/crypto-presale-frenzy-raises-over-122m-worth-of-sol-in-a-week/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">sent to memecoins</a>, most of which report millions in losses for investors.</p>

<p></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Despite experienced traders being able to <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1770705784764334188" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">profit</a> from this trend, the current numbers hint at a considerable amount of traders losing massive figures while trying to catch the next memecoin to go “turbo parabolic,” even if it doesn’t have a long-term roadmap.</p>

<title>Bernstein Analysts Says Bitcoin Will Reach A New ATH By Year End, Here’s The Target</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-new-ath-by-year-end/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-new-ath-by-year-end/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章指出，分析师们上调了比特币的价格预期，预计2024年年底比特币价格将达到90,000美元。另外，两家金融机构分别预测了比特币价格可能在2021年年底达到150,000美元。他们认为比特币交易所交易基金和矿工收入的增长将推动比特币价格上涨。文章还提到，比特币的价格目标可能在未来几年进一步增长，甚至可能在2025年达到250,000美元。<br /><br /> <div>
<p>Analysts at <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bernstein-bank-on-btc-mining-survival-consolidation-and-ai-diversification/" rel="nofollow">financial services firm Bernstein</a> are increasing their price expectations for Bitcoin. This follows a revised report in which they boosted their year-end target for the flagship crypto token’s price. </p>
<h2>Bitcoin To Hit $90,000 By The End Of 2024</h2>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/03/21/bitcoin-year-end-price-target-raised-to-90k-at-bernstein/" rel="nofollow">report</a> by CoinDesk, Bernstein analysts Gautam Chhugani and Mahika Sapra have raised their year-end prediction for Bitcoin’s price from $80,000 to $90,000. Their research report cited the strong <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-spot-etf-100-volume/" rel="nofollow">Spot Bitcoin ETF</a> inflow and a record mining income as the reasons for this increased bullishness on BTC&#8217;s price.</p>

<p>Since launching, the Spot Bitcoin ETFs have recorded an <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etfs-record-2-2-billion-inflow-in-past-week/" rel="nofollow">impressive amount of inflows</a> into their funds and have significantly contributed to an <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crosses-35000/">increase in BTC&#8217;s price</a>. As such, it is understandable why these analysts believe they could still positively impact Bitcoin’s price in the long run. </p>
<p>Despite <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/why-bitcoin-halving-could-bring-uncertainty-to-mining-industry/" rel="nofollow">miners’ rewards</a> being cut in half during the Halving event in mid-April, these Bernstein analysts also foresee a record mining income for BTC miners. They believe this would have a positive impact on BTC&#8217;s price. Bitcoinist <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/why-bitcoin-halving-could-bring-uncertainty-to-mining-industry/" rel="nofollow">recently reported</a> that Bitcoin Halving could force some miners out of business, paving the way for the remaining miners to enjoy increased revenue. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Chhugani and Sapra also <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-headed-for-150000/">recently reaffirmed</a> their prediction that Bitcoin will hit $150,000 by mid-2025. They believe that the Spot Bitcoin ETFs will be one of many factors contributing to this massive price surge. </p>
<h2>BTC Could Even Hit $150,000 This Year</h2>
<p>Standard Chartered is another financial institution that revised its year-end target for Bitcoin’s price. As against their <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/mark-your-calendars-bitcoin-to-hit-100000-by-end-of-2024-standard-chartered-says/">initial prediction</a> of $100,000, they <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/standard-chartered-bitcoin-ethereum-prediction-year-end/">recently stated</a> that Bitcoin could rise to $150,000 by the end of this year. Like Bernstein, Standard Chartered also alluded to the influence of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-spot-etfs-hits-150-billion-trading-volume/" rel="nofollow">Bitcoin ETFs</a> as the primary reason for their bullishness on Bitcoin. </p>

<p>The bank noted in the research report that these investment funds provide a more robust and sustainable positioning for Bitcoin, unlike when the crypto token hit new highs solely based on speculations. Standard Chartered also predicts that <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-demands-exceeds-supply/">BTC could rise to $200,000</a> by the end of 2025. </p>
<p>Interstingly, they added that an “overshoot to $250,000 is likely at some point in 2025 if <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etfs-record-2-2-billion-inflow-in-past-week/" rel="nofollow">ETF inflows</a> continue apace and reserve managers buy BTC.” These predictions, however, look conservative when one considers <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-reach-1-million/">Samson Mow’s prediction</a> that BTC could hit $1 million this year. </p>
<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $66,200, down over 1% in the last 24 hours, according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/" rel="nofollow">data</a> from CoinMarketCap. </p>

<title>FXS Price Poised For Uptrend As Frax Finance Unveils Roadmap To Reach $100B TVL</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/fxs-price-poised-for-uptrend-as-frax-finance-unveils-roadmap-to-reach-100b-tvl/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/fxs-price-poised-for-uptrend-as-frax-finance-unveils-roadmap-to-reach-100b-tvl/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。Frax Finance发布了Singularity Roadmap，计划将其Fraxtal的TVL增长到1000亿美元。他们已经实现了100%的抵押率，并计划通过引入Layer 3s在Fraxtal上建立23个L3s。此外，他们计划重新激活协议费用开关，并分配50%的收入给veFXS代币持有者。FXS代币在新闻面前没有做出积极反应，目前的交易价格为6.93美元。 <div>
<p>Frax Finance, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol, recently unveiled its Singularity Roadmap. It aims to propel the total value locked (TVL) of its <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/crypto/ethereum-based-frax-finance-is-up-64-upside/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">layer 2 blockchain</a>, Fraxtal, to $100 billion by the end of 2026. This notable surge would represent a 760,000% increase from the current TVL levels, which stand at $13 million. </p>
<h2>Frax Finance Singularity Roadmap</h2>
<p>According to the protocol’s <a href="https://gov.frax.finance/t/frax-singularity-roadmap-part-1/2987" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>, Fraxtal, the substrate that powers the Frax ecosystem, serves as Frax Finance&#8217;s operating system. With the launch of Fraxtal and achieving an effective 100% Collateralization Ratio (CR), Frax Finance claims to have consolidated its core product offerings. </p>

<p>To reach the ambitious $100 billion TVL goal, the protocol has announced that it has already generated over $45 million, reaching the coveted 100% CR. </p>
<p>As announced, with this milestone achieved, the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/token-spotlight-and-next-run-predictions-analysts-weekly-altcoins-watchlist-unveiled/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">FRAX stablecoin</a>, which has remained relatively dormant during the process, and the FXS revenue share, which has been temporarily reduced by 90% to conserve assets, can now undergo a &#8220;transformative change.&#8221; </p>
<p>In addition, the upcoming introduction of Layer 3s (L3s) on Fraxtal is expected to be a key factor in further contributing to the growth and adoption of the protocol.</p>
<p>Fraxtal, which is built on the Optimism (OP) network, stands out as one of the most widely used layer 2 solutions on top of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/ethereum-news/market-expert-highlights-top-coins-to-watch-as-ethereum-eth-reaches-22-month-high/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ethereum </a>(ETH), according to the protocol. The Frax team says it has developed its underlying incentives to provide a seamless experience for developers and users, further encouraging adoption. </p>
<p>In particular, by owning the entire stack, Frax can introduce advanced features such as account abstraction, new precompiles, privacy features, aggregated decentralized applications (dApps), and interoperability with Superchain. </p>
<p>The protocol believes these features will enhance the on-chain experience, making Fraxtal the “preferred” platform for holding, staking, and transferring crypto assets.</p>
<h2>Expansion Strategy</h2>
<p>The proposal also unveils Frax Finance&#8217;s plan to establish 23 Layer 3s within 365 days, kicking off the &#8220;Fraxtal Nation&#8221; community. By supporting these 23 chains with developer access, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/defi/curve-exchange-trading-volumes-plunge-97-in-2-months/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">incentives, </a>and investment, Frax aims to foster a positive-sum approach and provide additional support to official partners. </p>
<p>The protocol also suggests that these partners will receive &#8220;substantial allocations&#8221; of FXTL points, aiming to solidify the role of the FXS token as the ultimate beneficiary of the Frax ecosystem.</p>
<p>Moreover, Frax Finance founder Sam Kazemian intends to allocate 50% of the revenue from <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/crv/curve-founder-michael-egorov-clears-aave-loan-reduces-total-debt-to-42-7-million/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">protocol fees</a> to veFXS token holders. In comparison, the remaining 50% will be used to acquire FXS and other Frax assets for pairing in the FXS Liquidity Engine (FLE). </p>
<p>This initiative will increase liquidity, strengthen the Frax balance sheet, and provide additional incentives for the protocol&#8217;s stakeholders.</p>

<p>Frax Finance&#8217;s proposal also seeks to reactivate the protocol fee switch, which was temporarily turned off during the consolidation phase of the protocol. </p>
<p>By reigniting this switch, a portion of the yield generated from protocol fees will be directed toward veFXS token holders. veFXS, or veiled FXS, represents a locked version of the native token, FXS, and offers enhanced voting power and participation in the Frax ecosystem.</p>
<img alt="Frax Finance" class="size-large" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/sG7GhG62/" width="1815" />
<p>As of the time of writing, FXS has not responded favorably to the news. Its current trading price is $6.93, reflecting a 3.5% loss in the past 24 hours. It is important to note that the proposed protocol features are still in development, and the impact on the Frax Finance ecosystem and the token&#8217;s performance is yet to be determined.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Market Cap Hints at Potential Price Surge After Retesting 2021 Highs</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-market-cap-price-surgeretesting-2021-highs/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-market-cap-price-surgeretesting-2021-highs/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。一位加密分析师对比特币充满信心，预计未来几天将会有显著的涨幅。文章指出比特币市值正试图重新测试当时的最高价。然而，目前市场动态仍在变化，机构的介入也在加剧价格波动。尽管美联储决定保持5.5%的利率，但价格仍无法突破70,000美元。此外，BTC ETF的吸引力减弱可能导致价格下跌。<br /> <div>
<p>A crypto analyst on X is confident that Bitcoin has <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/el_crypto_prof/status/1770928605540807071" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">bottomed</a> and is poised for major gains in the sessions ahead. Interestingly, the bullish outlook hinges on the Bitcoin market cap retesting all-time highs at press time. </p>
<h2>Will BTC Rally? Market Dynamics Changing</h2>
<p>So far, the Bitcoin price is around 2021 highs in USD terms but recently broke all-time highs, peaking at around $73,800. This fluctuation is also reflected in its market cap. It currently stands at $1.25 trillion, down 5% in the past 24 hours. </p>

<p>Notably, it is at the same price level as in 2021, when Bitcoin prices peaked, recording new all-time highs.</p>
<img alt="Bitcoin market cap at 2021 highs | Source: Analyst on X" class="size-full wp-image-599226" height="524" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GJOZbNhW4AATXjP.jpg?resize=1024%2C524" width="1024" />
<p>While optimism abounds and the trader expects more sharp price expansions in the days ahead, it is not immediately clear whether the coin will rip higher, aligning with this forecast. Bitcoin is volatile and has remained so despite changing market dynamics. </p>
<p>At the same time, unlike in the past, Bitcoin prices are driven not only by retail forces but by institutions. These institutions are regulated by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/press-releases/sec-chair-gary-gensler-bitcoin-is-a-highly-speculative-asset-class-optimism-drives-investors-to-polygon-and-this-emerging-ai-altcoin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">SEC</a>), which also approved the spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). </p>
<p>This Bitcoin derivative product has been the primary driving force in the past ten weeks. This is from looking at how prices have evolved since its approval in mid-January 2024. </p>
<p>However, since BlackRock and Fidelity are regulated by the United States SEC, unlike retailers, they cannot act as they wish. Considering the millions and billions of dollars at play, their comments or assessments on the coin, now and in the future, can greatly impact sentiment.</p>
<h2>Sentiment Is Dented, BTC Facing Headwinds</h2>
<p>Sentiment has been dented when writing. Even with the United States Federal Reserve (Fed) &#8216;s decision to hold rates at 5.5%, the highest in 2023, lifting prices, there has been no solid follow-through in price action. The coin remains steady below $70,000.
</p>
<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/x/mvO7u3kF/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="Bitcoin price trending downward on the daily chart | Source: BTCUSDT on Binance, TradingView" class="size-full" height="904" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/mvO7u3kF/" width="1787" /></a>
<p>Whether prices will rally over the weekend remains to be seen. However, for now, there are some headwinds to consider. </p>

<p>First, there has been a slowdown in inflows to spot BTC ETFs. At the same time, outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) have <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-spot-etf-outflows/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">increased</a>. Second, after rallying sharply from October 2023, a cool-off before halving might see the coin trend lower.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Troubles Far From Over As More Carnage Looms, JPMorgan Analysts</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。JPMorgan的分析师警告比特币可能会经历进一步的回撤，认为比特币仍然被过度买入。他们预计在四月中旬的减半事件之前会出现进一步的价格下跌。另外，预计投资者将继续获利，导致价格进一步下跌。尽管市场预期升值，但JPMorgan依然持有对于比特币价格的悲观态度。 <div>
<p>Despite optimism about <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bull-market-glassnode/" rel="nofollow">Bitcoin’s future trajectory</a> heading into the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/why-bitcoin-halving-could-bring-uncertainty-to-mining-industry/" rel="nofollow">Bitcoin Halving</a>, analysts at JPMorgan have raised concerns that things may not go according to everyone’s expectations. They believe that a storm still lies ahead for the flagship crypto token before any massive move to the upside. </p>
<h2>Further Bitcoin Pullbacks Are To Be Expected</h2>
<p>According to a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-21/bitcoin-on-track-for-worst-week-in-months-as-etf-demand-falters" rel="nofollow">report</a>, JPMorgan strategists have warned that Bitcoin could still experience further pullbacks following its recent decline. They alluded to the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-spot-etfs-hits-150-billion-trading-volume/" rel="nofollow">recent net outflows</a> recorded by the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etfs-record-2-2-billion-inflow-in-past-week/" rel="nofollow">Spot Bitcoin ETFs</a>, which underscored the current bearish sentiment in the Bitcoin ecosystem. </p>

<p>These strategists, led by Nikolaos Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou, also highlighted the sustained open interest in CME Bitcoin futures as another bearish signal for Bitcoin’s price. They further argue that Bitcoin “still looks overbought” and expect further price dips leading up to the Halving event in mid-April. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, these JPMorgan analysts emphasized the decline in net inflows into Spot ETFs, noting that this proves that a sustained one-way net inflow is not possible. Therefore, they expect <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-sheds-nearly-1-billion-in-grayscale-bitcoin-etf/" rel="nofollow">investors in these funds</a> to keep taking profits heading into the Bitcoin Halving. This wave of profit-taking is also more likely, considering that Bitcoin “still looks overbought despite the past week’s correction.” they claimed. </p>
<p>This recent research note by JPMorgan further reaffirms their bearish sentiment towards Bitcoin’s price despite the flagship crypto exceeding expectations. Last month, the bank predicted that Bitcoin could drop to as low as $42,000 after April as “Bitcoin-halving-induced euphoria subsides.”</p>
<p>Naeem Aslam, chief investment officer at Zaye Capital Markets, also echoed JPMoragn’s sentiments when he suggested that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-breaks-through-69000-setting-new-record/" rel="nofollow">Bitcoin’s recent rally</a> didn’t show enough strength. Aslam believes Bitcoin could fall below $50,000 if the Halving event “fails to really keep the momentum going.”</p>
<h2>What Could Happen After The Halving Event</h2>
<p>Crypto trader and analyst Rekt Capital <a href="https://x.com/rektcapital/status/1769656725341163692?s=20" rel="nofollow">recently provided</a> insights into what could happen after the Havling event while elaborating on the four phases of Bitcoin Halving. According to him, there is usually a re-accumulation period after the Halving, which could last for up to five months. </p>

<p>During this period, he noted that many investors get “shaken out in this stage due to boredom, impatience, and disappointment with lack of major results in their <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-a-decades-long-investment-ceo-says-despite-recent-downturn/" rel="nofollow">BTC investment</a> in the immediate aftermath of the Halving.” Rekt Capital added that this time could be different since it is the first time this <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-whales-buying-spree/">re-accumulation</a> could develop around the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-breaks-through-69000-setting-new-record/" rel="nofollow">new all-time high (ATH) area</a>. </p>
<p>Therefore, he believes this “Re-Accumulation Range may simply take the shape of a regular sideways range and may not last very long before additional uptrend continuation.”</p>

<title>This Bitcoin Halving May Not Result In Supply Squeeze: Glassnode</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-halving-result-supply-squeeze-glassnode/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-halving-result-supply-squeeze-glassnode/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要: 这些信息是积极的。<br />Glassnode指出，即将到来的比特币减半不太可能导致市场预期的供应紧缩。这是因为现在有Spot ETFs，这在过去是不存在的。这些投资工具带来了大量新的需求，将供应快速从市场中带走。根据Glassnode的比较，ETF的流入量通常远高于矿工在链上每日发行的比特币数量。他们认为，由于ETF的大规模和持续的购买活动，即将到来的减半可能不会像预期的那样导致供应紧缩。 <div>
<p>Glassnode has suggested that the upcoming Bitcoin halving might not result in a supply squeeze that the market may have anticipated.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Halving May Not Carry Same Impact Due To Spot ETFs</h2>
<p>In a new report, the on-chain analytics firm <a href="https://insights.glassnode.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Glassnode</a> has discussed the impact the next Bitcoin halving may have on the economics of the cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>The &#8220;<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-halving-retrace-investors/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">halving</a>&#8221; is a periodic event for BTC where its block rewards (the rewards the miners receive for adding blocks on the network) are permanently cut in half.</p>

<p>This event is built into the coin&#8217;s code, meaning it happens automatically. The halving kicks in after every 210,000 blocks, or approximately every four years.</p>
<p>The next such event will take place sometime in the coming month. Historically, the halving has been considered an important event for the asset due to how it influences its supply dynamics.</p>
<p>The block rewards the miners receive are the only way to introduce new BTC tokens into circulation. Since they get tightened during these events, the cryptocurrency&#8217;s production rate slows down following them.</p>
<p>As such, halvings are considered bullish events, with the price increasing following them due to the constrained supply, as supply-demand dynamics would dictate.</p>
<p>&#8220;However, the current market conditions differ from historical norms,&#8221; says Glassnode. The reason behind that is simple; there is something now that was never there in the past: the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/beyond-bitcoin-etfs-there-are-other-players/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs)</a>.</p>
<p>Spot ETFs are investment vehicles that buy and hold Bitcoin and allow their users to gain indirect exposure to the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price action through them. Since the spot ETFs are available on traditional exchanges, they can be preferable for those not looking to dabble with digital asset platforms and wallets.</p>
<p>Thus, the ETFs have introduced a notable amount of fresh demand for the asset, with supply rapidly leaving the market and entering these funds. To put this demand into perspective, the analytics firm has compared it against the BTC amount miners issue on the chain daily.</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Miner Issuance Vs Spot ETFs" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="1013" src="https://i0.wp.com/insights.glassnode.com/content/images/2024/03/glassnode-studio_btc-miner-issuance-vs-spot-etfs-demand--1-.png?resize=1800%2C1013&#038;ssl=1" width="1800" /></p>

<p>As the above chart shows, the Bitcoin ETF flows have generally been much higher than what the miners have been introducing into circulation. Based on this, Glassnode believes &#8220;the upcoming halving might not result in the supply squeeze once anticipated.&#8221;</p>

<p>The report further says:</p>
<blockquote><p>The ETFs are, in essence, preempting the halving&#8217;s impact by already tightening the available supply through their substantial and continuous buying activity. In other words, the supply squeeze usually expected from halvings may already be in effect due to ETFs’ large-scale bitcoin acquisitions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Something to note, however, is that the ETFs aren&#8217;t certain to always be a bullish influence for the market. Should the current inflow-heavy regime flip to one dominated by outflows, the cryptocurrency could naturally witness extraordinary selling pressure.</p>
<p>In fact, the spot ETF netflows have been negative for Bitcoin for <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-reclaims-66000-despite-4-day-etf-outflow-streak/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">four straight days</a> now, so such a trend shift may already be in action.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>Bitcoin had recovered beyond the $68,000 level yesterday, but the coin has since declined again, falling back towards $64,200.</p>

<title>Fantom (FTM) Jumps 180% In 4 Weeks: Just The Beginning?</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/fantom-ftm-jumps-180-4-weeks-just-the-beginning/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/fantom-ftm-jumps-180-4-weeks-just-the-beginning/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。Fantom（FTM）在过去24小时中表现出色，价格涨幅达13.5％，过去四周涨幅达180％。这一涨势主要归因于即将到来的Sonic升级，旨在提高Fantom技术堆栈的可伸缩性，从而提高交易吞吐量。Andre Cronje的承诺和Coinbase的宣布也是价格上涨的动力。技术分析显示Fantom价格在逐渐上升，目标位于Fibonacci的不同级别。整体而言，Fantom面临积极前景。 <div>
<p>Over the past 24 hours, Fantom (FTM) has emerged as the standout performer among the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, registering a remarkable 13.5% gain. This surge is part of a broader rally that has seen the FTM price soar by 180% over the last four weeks, propelling it from $0.42 to $1.20. This upward trajectory has significantly boosted Fantom&#8217;s market capitalization to $3.3 billion, positioning it as the 41st largest digital asset worldwide. Here&#8217;s why this might be just the beginning:</p>
<h2>#1 Sonic Upgrade: The Catalyst for Fantom&#8217;s Rally</h2>
<p>The anticipated Sonic upgrade is central to Fantom&#8217;s recent success. Designed to enhance the Fantom technology stack, Sonic introduces major scalability improvements without necessitating a disruptive <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/now-that-optimism-bedrock-hard-fork-is-done-what-can-we-expect/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">hard fork</a>. Key components of the <a href="https://twitter.com/QuickNode/status/1769749849099174122" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Sonic upgrade</a> include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fantom Virtual Machine (FVM): </strong>Aims to significantly boost transaction throughput.</li>
<li><strong>Carmen Database: </strong>Promises to reduce storage requirements by up to 90%.</li>
<li><strong>Optimized Lachesis Consensus: </strong>Improves upon the existing consensus mechanism for enhanced performance.</li>
</ul>
<p>With these enhancements, Fantom targets a throughput of over 2,000 transactions per second (TPS), marking a substantial leap in scalability. Importantly, the upgrade ensures that existing Fantom Opera smart contracts and tools remain fully compatible with the Sonic mainnet, which is scheduled to launch in Spring 2024.</p>

<p>Recent testnets have demonstrated Sonic&#8217;s potential. The closed testnet, focused on ERC-20 swaps, achieved an impressive ~4,000 TPS with ~1.3-second finality. Furthermore, a reconfiguration to process only ERC-20 transfers led to a groundbreaking ~10,000 TPS at ~1.6-second finality, showcasing the capabilities of next-generation decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and wallets.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">10k tps achieved. Publicly verifiable. Can test for yourself, on public infrastructure. No need for &quot;trust me bro&quot;. Available today, no need to wait. And we havent even started with the parallel execution meme. <a href="https://t.co/q2QRKM9WXe" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/q2QRKM9WXe</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Andre Cronje (@AndreCronjeTech) <a href="https://twitter.com/AndreCronjeTech/status/1768688491225837764?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">March 15, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Reflecting on Sonic&#8217;s impact, Reflexivity Research <a href="https://twitter.com/FantomFDN/status/1770851499314188683" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">highlighted</a>, &#8220;Fantom Sonic unlocks new possibilities for the Fantom ecosystem, particularly in decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/web3/what-is-web3-gaming-top-web3-games-companies/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">blockchain games</a>, high-frequency applications, and the Internet of Things (IoT).&#8221;</p>
<p>The research firm added that another cornerstone for Fantom is its exemplary 99.9% uptime. “Fantom&#8217;s novel solutions position it as a frontrunner in the development of decentralized networks,” Reflexivity Research stated.</p>
#2 Andre Cronje: The Innovator&#8217;s Promise
<p>Andre Cronje, the founder of Fantom and one of the brightest minds in the crypto industry, has been instrumental in driving innovation within the ecosystem. Cronje recently underscored his commitment to advancing the crypto space, <a href="https://twitter.com/AndreCronjeTech/status/1770821896671510803" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">stating</a>, &#8220;The number 1 dex on <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/crypto-analyst-base-next-memecoin-hotspot-top-8/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Base</a>, and the number 1 dex on Optimism are both built with code I wrote and pioneered. Stick to where the innovators are, post Sonic I will be adding some new primitives to crypto.&#8221;</p>

#3 Coinbase Announcement: A New Milestone
<p>Another factor driving today’s price rally is probably today’s Coinbase International announcement that it will launch Fantom perpetual futures on Coinbase International Exchange and Coinbase Advanced, set to commence on or after 9:30am UTC on March 28, 2024. This move by Coinbase is expected to further enhance Fantom&#8217;s liquidity and accessibility, contributing to its growing appeal among investors.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/CoinbaseIntExch?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">@CoinbaseIntExch</a> will add support for Fantom and THORChain perpetual futures on Coinbase International Exchange and Coinbase Advanced. The opening of our FTM-PERP and RUNE-PERP markets will begin on or after 9:30am UTC on 28 MAR 2024. <a href="https://t.co/CHBVF58ISc" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/CHBVF58ISc</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Coinbase International Exchange <img alt="🛡" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f6e1.png" style="height: 1em;" /> (@CoinbaseIntExch) <a href="https://twitter.com/CoinbaseIntExch/status/1770842554231292035?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">March 21, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
#4 Technical Analysis: FTM/USD
<p>The bullish momentum of Fantom price is apparent in the weekly FTM/USD chart on Binance, signified by the latest candlestick closure above the key exponential moving averages (EMAs) of 20, 50, 100, and 200 periods. This week&#8217;s candlestick represents a notable increase of approximately 50% from the intra-week low.</p>
<p>Fantom&#8217;s ascent has propelled its value beyond the 0.382 Fibonacci retracement level, situated at $0.9176. This bullish breakout suggests the market may target subsequent Fibonacci levels, with $1.38 (0.382 Fib) acting as an intermediate psychological and technical resistance, followed by $1.76 (05 Fib), and potentially extending towards the golden ratio at $2.13, which corresponds with the 0.618 Fibonacci level.</p>
<p>On the flip side of this bullish scenario, should a correction occur across the broader crypto market, immediate support for FTM can be anticipated at the $0.92 level. Stability at or above this threshold could reaffirm bullish market control. Conversely, a downward breach could intensify selling pressure, possibly leading to a retest of support around the $0.56 mark.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Spot ETFs See 4 Consecutive Days Of Outflows, Here’s What Happened Last Time</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-spot-etf-outflows/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-spot-etf-outflows/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。本周比特币价格下跌，并连续四天出现了资金流出现象，主要来自Grayscale比特币ETF。这是今年第二次出现这种情况。不过，过去出现这种情况后，比特币价格出现了快速上涨，从4万美元涨至7万美元。这表明如果资金流入超过流出，比特币价格可能会再次开始上涨。 <div>
<p class="p2"><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-reclaims-66000-despite-4-day-etf-outflow-streak/">Bitcoin Spot ETF outflows</a> have ramped up this week and has seen the week characterized by price declines throughout the crypto space. These outflows, like before, are being led by the Grayscale Spot ETF as investors believe their fees are too high. This has led to four consecutive week of outflows, which is the second time it is happening since <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-etf-frenzy-blackrock-smashes-expectations-with-788-million-inflows-in-one-day/">Spot ETFs</a> were approved for trading. So, where does the Bitcoin price go from here?</p>
<h2 class="p2">Bitcoin Spot ETFs Hit 4 Consecutive Days Of Outflows</h2>
<p class="p2">The outflows began on Monday and continued into subsequent days. So far, the highest single-day outflow happened on Tuesday, March 19, with total net flows for the day coming out to $326.2 million, a new record for Bitcoin funds.</p>

<p class="p2">Subsequent days have seen lower figures when it comes to overall net flows but they continue to come out in the negative. On Wednesday, net flows were $261.5 million, and on Thursday, March 22, net flows came out to $94 million. This marked the second time that the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/blackrock-spot-bitcoin-etf-launches-in-brazil-etf-market-secures-4-of-total-btc-supply/">Spot Bitcoin ETFs</a> are seeing four consecutive days of outflows this year.</p>
<p class="p2">The vast majority of these outflows, as mentioned above, are coming from the Grayscale Bitcoin ETF. In the last day alone, the fund saw outflows of 5,900 BTC, which translates to $339 million at current prices. Then, over the last week, Coinglass data <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/bitcoin-etf" rel="nofollow">shows</a> that 28,207.5834 BTC has left the fund, causing its total BTC under management to fall by 7.35% in one week.</p>
<p class="p2">Other funds have also seen outflows during this time but to a much lower degree. For example, the Invesco Galaxy <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/us-spot-bitcoin-etfs-experience-record-outflows-losing-740-million-in-three-days/">Bitcoin ETF</a> saw the second-highest outflow of all the funds, but only 667 BTC flowed out of the fund in the last day. The WisdomTree Bitcoin Fund saw 10.8.2635 BTC in outflows, while all other outflow figures came in below 100 BTC.</p>
<h2 class="p2">What Happened To BTC The Last Time?</h2>
<p class="p2">The last time that <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/us-spot-bitcoin-etfs-experience-record-outflows-losing-740-million-in-three-days/">Spot Bitcoin ETFs</a> saw four consecutive days of outflows was in January, lasting from January 22 to January 25. This also bears some similarities to the current outflow trend in some was, one of which was the outflows began at the start of the week and carried through to the end.</p>

<p class="p2">However, a difference between both times is that the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/beyond-bitcoin-etfs-there-are-other-players/">ETFs</a> had just begun trading with trading days fluctuating between inflows and outflows. Meanwhile, the current trend has come after almost two consecutive weeks of inflows, something that could have an impact on the BTC price going forward.</p>
<p class="p2">In January, after four days, the outflows had begun to slow down, and by Friday, there was a change in direction, with inflows beginning to dominate. Once the tide turned and <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-etf-frenzy-blackrock-smashes-expectations-with-788-million-inflows-in-one-day/">ETF inflows</a> began to rise, the BTC price followed sharply.</p>
<p class="p2">With the climb came a more established rally in the Bitcoin price, causing it to go from $40,000 to over $70,000 in the space of two months. If this trend repeats and inflows into <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-reclaims-66000-despite-4-day-etf-outflow-streak/">Spot BTC ETFs</a> outpace outflows, then the BTC price is expected to start climbing again. However, if the outflows continue, then the BTC price could be in for further crashes.</p>

<title>XRP Set For Rapid Rally, Target At $5 In The Short Term</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-set-for-rapid-rally-target-at-5-in-the-short-term/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-set-for-rapid-rally-target-at-5-in-the-short-term/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章介绍了XRP加密货币的当前表现和分析预测。分析师认为XRP可能在即将到来的牛市中达到新的高点，价格目标设定在$5。预测指出，XRP可能会在4月前达到$1的价格。文章还讨论了XRP在2021年落后的原因，包括法律诉讼和开发人员出售大量代币。同时，市场整体呈现强势，全球加密市值达到2.5万亿美元。其他主要加密资产如比特币、以太坊、莱特币等也被分析师认为可能获得巨大涨幅。 <div>
<p>XRP continues to maintain its spot as one of the leading cryptocurrency assets in the crypto market today after witnessing a notable rally starting the day at the $0.64 price mark, putting it in the limelight.</p>
<p>Although the price of XRP is still lagging behind its all-time high level of $3.30, some analysis indicates that it may soon start to rise toward its peak. Following the recent rise, several analysts anticipate XRP will rally even further and reach unprecedented heights in the upcoming months.</p>
<h2>Short-Term Price Target Set At $5 For XRP</h2>
<p>Jake Gagain, a cryptocurrency expert and trader, has <a href="https://x.com/JakeGagain/status/1770933411915731100?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">made</a> a daring prediction for XRP, noting that the asset could reach a new peak in this bull cycle. The analyst forecast delves into the crypto asset&#8217;s potential to move higher before and after the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-halving-retrace-investors/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin Halving</a> event, which is expected to take place in April.</p>

<p>Gagain asserts that &#8220;XRP is one of the top crypto assets today.&#8221; However, &#8220;unlike other notable coins,&#8221; the coin achieved its all-time high record of $3.30 over 6 years ago.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Gagain claims that the token was unable to reach a new peak in the 2021 bull run due to its legal disputes with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). </p>
<p>In December 2020, the SEC charged Ripple with raising over $1.3 billion through the sale of XRP in an unregistered securities offering, which Gagain believes was the reason for the coin lagging behind in 2021. Another factor considered by Gagain was the massive number of tokens that &#8220;developers were dumping &#8220;on a monthly basis.&#8221; </p>
<p>However, if the company manages to win the lawsuit, Gagain believes XRP could hit a new all-time high at the climax of the present bull cycle. As a result, the crypto analyst is placing his price target at the $5 threshold after the bull run ends.</p>
<p>According to Jake Gagain, the Bitcoin halving event is just around 30 days away, and the market is already showing strong momentum. Specifically, the entire crypto market cap is at $2.5 trillion, indicating an over 4% increase in the past day after a slow week.</p>
<p>Gagain also addressed a few other leading crypto assets in the market, predicting massive gains before the halving. These include <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-reclaims-66000-despite-4-day-etf-outflow-streak/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> &#8211; the biggest digital asset, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-signals-uptrend-3580/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ethereum (ETH)</a>, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-ethereum-surge-200/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Solana (SOL)</a>, and <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano/cardano-ada-eyes-explosive-2000-bull-run-targeting-12-and-quadrupling-ath/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Cardano (ADA)</a>.</p>
<h2>$1 Target For April In Progress</h2>
<p>Another crypto <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/why-xrp-price-rise-1700-to-10/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">analyst</a> optimistic about XRP is Dark Defender, <a href="https://x.com/DefendDark/status/1770382349424791959?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">predicting</a> that a &#8220;$1 price mark by April is in progress.&#8221; This suggests that the coin could attain this level before the halving occurrence.</p>

<p>Dark Defender highlighted that as of February 28, the asset was trading at $0.58. Meanwhile, he expects XRP to be pegged at &#8220;$0.6462 by March 1, $0.77-$0.92 on March 13, and $1 by April.&#8221;</p>
<p>Given the new peak of $0.75, he believes the Fibonacci Levels in the short term will be at $0.9772-$1.5048, $2.3172. He expects his April targets to develop &#8220;if XRP maintains the $0.58 Orange Support level, which performed admirably.&#8221;</p>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。稳定币的市值最近达到了一个重要的里程碑，每日交易量达到了1220亿美元。稳定币市场的增长和复苏主要归因于市场动态和增长因素，以及泰达币的主导作用和市场影响。泰达币的市场占有率达到70%，超过1000亿美元的市值。加密货币社区正在庆祝稳定币市值的增长，认为这是即将到来的繁荣的迹象。稳定币市值的增长意味着更多的资金流入加密货币，为交易提供了更多的流动性，并可能推高价格。这对整个市场的增长有潜在的影响。这表明稳定币市场的成熟和扩张，以及其对数字经济的重要基础设施。 <div>
<p>Stablecoins have recently achieved a significant milestone,<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/stablecoins" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> surpassing $150 billion</a> in market capitalization, with daily trading volume reaching $122 billion. This achievement marks a notable resurgence and growth in the stablecoin sector, with implications for the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem.</p>

<h2 class="text-lg mt-6 mb-2 first:mt-3">Market Dynamics And Growth Factors</h2>
<p>Stablecoins are digital assets designed to maintain a stable value by pegging their price to a reserve asset, such as the US dollar or other fiat currencies. They serve as a crucial bridge between traditional finance and the crypto space, offering stability and liquidity for users and investors.</p>
<p>The recent surge in the stablecoin market can be attributed to several key factors. Firstly, the growing demand for stable assets in the volatile crypto market has driven increased adoption of stablecoins as a safe haven for traders and investors. Additionally, the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms has fueled the demand for stablecoins as a means of conducting transactions, providing liquidity, and earning yields.</p>

<h2 class="text-lg mt-6 mb-2 first:mt-3">Tether&#8217;s Dominance And Market Impact</h2>
<p>Tether (USDT), one of the most widely used stablecoins, has played a significant role in driving the growth of the stablecoin market. With a market capitalization exceeding $100 billion, Tether&#8217;s dominance underscores its position as a key player in the crypto space.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly dominant in this sector, Tether commands a 70% market share. With a market capitalization of over $31 billion, USD Coin (USDC), the second largest stablecoin, grants Circle&#8217;s stablecoin a market share exceeding 20%. At the time of writing, DAI held a 3% market share and $4.7 billion, placing it in third position.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/IZPj1J8q/" width="2475" /></p>

<p>Tether&#8217;s market impact extends beyond its role as a stable asset, as it has faced scrutiny and regulatory challenges due to concerns about its reserve backing and transparency. Despite these challenges, Tether&#8217;s resilience and continued dominance highlight the strong demand for stablecoins and their utility in the digital economy.</p>
Crypto Enthusiasts Celebrate Stablecoins&#8217; Rising Market Cap
<p>The crypto community is cheering the rising market cap of stablecoins, seeing it as a sign of coming prosperity.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Total Stablecoin Mcap:</p>
<p>Mar 21st. $147b.
Feb 21st. $138b.
Jan 21st. $133b.
Dec 21st. $130b.
Nov 21st. $127b.
Oct 21st. $124b.</p>
<p>it is impossible and stupid to not be bullish on DeFi whilst this chart is just up and to the right for the last 6 months. <a href="https://t.co/qkcERkIXi8" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/qkcERkIXi8</a></p>
<p>— ZeroToTom (@zerototom) <a href="https://twitter.com/zerototom/status/1770794504615813352?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">March 21, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>A growing market cap suggests more money is flowing into crypto, providing much-needed liquidity for trading and potentially pushing prices up. Additionally, stablecoins offer a safe haven during market dips, potentially encouraging more investors to enter the broader crypto market. This increased comfort and investment could fuel the entire market&#8217;s growth.</p>

<h2 class="text-lg mt-6 mb-2 first:mt-3">Implications For The Crypto Ecosystem</h2>
<p>The surpassing of $150 billion in stablecoin market capitalization signifies a maturing and expanding crypto ecosystem. Stablecoins have become essential infrastructure in the digital economy, enabling seamless transactions, cross-border payments, and financial services innovation.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Price Reclaims $66,000 Despite 4-Day ETF Outflow Streak</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章提到了比特币现货交易所交易所交易基金（ETF）连续四天的净流出情况，但比特币价格却成功突破了66000美元。具体谈到了不同ETF的资金流向，以及一些专家和分析师对出现的情况的看法。尽管某些ETF出现了大额流出，但其他ETF仍在保持稳定。整体来看，尽管近期情况令人失望，但来自Grayscale的大额流出主要是暂时的，而其他ETF的小额流入将产生重大影响。BTC目前的交易价格为66203美元。 <div>
<p>Despite a continuous four-day streak of net outflows from Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) totaling $93.85 million, the Bitcoin price has impressively climbed to reclaim the $66,000 mark. According to data from Farside Investors, Grayscale ETF GBTC experienced a significant outflow yesterday, with a single-day net outflow of $358 million, culminating in a historical net outflow of $13.63 billion for GBTC alone.</p>
<p>In stark contrast, the BlackRock Bitcoin spot ETF (IBIT) witnessed a considerable net inflow of $233 million yesterday, raising IBIT&#8217;s total net inflow to $13.32 billion. This is slightly below the average for <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-etf-frenzy-blackrock-smashes-expectations-with-788-million-inflows-in-one-day/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">BlackRock</a>, which has seen $271.9 million in inflows since its launch on January 11.</p>
<p>Other ETFs have not fared as well in recent days. Fidelity&#8217;s FBTC, the second-largest ETF, has thus far achieved an average daily inflow of $141.5 million, but experienced a disappointing $2.5 million in inflows yesterday.</p>

<p>The third-largest, Ark Invest&#8217;s spot Bitcoin ETF, has seen average inflows of $40.9 million to date, with yesterday&#8217;s inflows at just $2.0 million. Bitwise&#8217;s BITB, ranking fourth, has accumulated $30.7 million on average, with a modest $12 million in inflows yesterday.</p>
<p>Across the board, all spot Bitcoin ETFs, including GBTC, have recorded an average of approximately $230 million in daily inflows since January 11.</p>
<img alt="Bitcoin ETF flows " class="wp-image-599159 size-full" height="1295" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GJPt5wIX0AAJalE.jpg?resize=983%2C1295" width="983" />
<h2>Bitcoin Price Stagnates: Reason To Worry?</h2>
<p>CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju <a href="https://twitter.com/ki_young_ju/status/1771038205623865426" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">provided</a> insights on the situation via X, stating, &#8220;Bitcoin spot ETF netflows are slowing. Demand may rebound if the BTC price approaches critical support levels. New whales, mainly ETF buyers, have a $56K on-chain cost basis. Corrections typically entail a max drawdown of around 30% in bull markets, with a max pain of $51K.&#8221;</p>
<p>Crypto analyst WhalePanda <a href="https://twitter.com/WhalePanda/status/1771020903138144692" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">highlighted</a> the trend, noting, &#8220;Yesterday&#8217;s ETF flows: Another negative day, that&#8217;s 4 in a row [&#8230;] Honestly surprised by how big the outflows are from GBTC. Another $358.8 million and that makes a total of $1.83 billion in just 4 days.&#8221; WhalePanda also touched on <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-breaks-past-51500-4-key-reasons/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Genesis&#8217; role</a>, suggesting the company&#8217;s “in-kind” sale of GBTC shares for BTC might explain the large outflows without corresponding market dumps.</p>

<p>Thomas Fahrer, founder of Apollo, <a href="https://twitter.com/thomas_fahrer/status/1770938965350129933" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">offered</a> a bullish perspective, &#8220;I know it is forbidden to post anything bullish on #Bitcoin ETFs right now, but I&#8217;m gonna do it anyway. GBTC selling is temporary. Financial advisors and institutions have barely begun buying. $100 BILLION inflows are coming next 1-2 years. Patience.&#8221;</p>
<p>Charles Edwards, founder of Capriole Investments, <a href="https://twitter.com/caprioleio/status/1771028291496911296" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">commented</a> on the Grayscale situation, &#8220;Grayscale Bitcoin ETF holdings falling off a cliff. Down 50%, or about $20B at current BTC price. We must be days/weeks away from them slashing fees to stop the bleeding. Blackrock holdings expected to overtake Grayscale <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/when-is-the-next-btc-halving-date-bitcoin-halving-guide/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">before the Halving</a>!&#8221;</p>
<p>Although the last few days have been rather disappointing, it is worth noting that the outflows are coming (almost) exclusively from <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/record-breaking-gbtc-outflows-send-bitcoin-down-14-to-62000/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Grayscale&#8217;s GBTC</a>, while other investors are holding on tight to their Bitcoin investments. This means that it is only a matter of time before Grayscale&#8217;s outflows stop, and even small inflows from the other ETFs make a big impact (without the outflows).</p>
<p>At press time, BTC traded $66,203.</p>

<title>BONK Bonked: Price Crashes 30% In 7 Days – More Pain Ahead?</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bonk-bonked-price-crashes-30-in-7-days-more-pain-ahead/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。BONK memecoin最近价格下跌，导致开放利息下降至一个月来的最低水平。市场表现和价格预测显示可能进一步下跌。尽管有技术指标暗示价格可能会下跌，但预测对BONK未来表现持续不确定。投资者情绪受到影响，市场动态也发生变化，预测对BONK价格也存在分歧。 <div>
<p>The memecoin BONK has faced a significant setback as its prices <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bonk1/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">plummeted by 30%</a> in the last week, sparking discussions about the need to reassess predictions for this meme token. This decline in value has been accompanied by a drop in BONK&#8217;s open interest to its lowest level in the past month, signaling potential challenges ahead for the token.</p>

<h2 class="text-lg mt-6 mb-2 first:mt-3">Market Performance And Price Predictions</h2>
<p>The recent slump in BONK&#8217;s prices has raised concerns among investors and traders, with key technical indicators hinting at the possibility of further declines in its value. At present, BONK is trading at $0.000023, making it one of the cryptocurrencies with the most losses over the past week. The altcoin&#8217;s future trajectory remains uncertain as market dynamics continue to evolve.</p>

<p>Following a rejection at $0.00004, the price of BONK lost momentum and had a 35% value adjustment. After then, there was a period of sideways trading for the memecoin. The bulls lost steam as the volatility increased and broke through the support level; the market has been trading sideways ever since.</p>
<p>The recent analysis of BONK&#8217;s price performance reveals a shift in sentiment towards bearish outlooks, with weighted sentiment turning negative and key technical indicators confirming the presence of bearish sentiments. This negative sentiment among market participants could potentially lead to further declines in BONK&#8217;s value unless there is a significant shift in market dynamics.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-599133" height="329" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_db0591.png?resize=1024%2C329" width="1024" /></p>

<h2>Open Interest Plummets</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.coinglass.com/currencies/BONK" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Futures open interest</a> in the cryptocurrency fell to its lowest level in one month, which led to a decrease in its price. The open interest in BONK began to fall on March 5th and has since fallen by 60%, according to statistics from Coinglass.</p>
<p>Traders&#8217; interest or involvement in the derivative market for an asset declines as its open interest diminishes. This usually happens when there is a change in investor mood, leading to more people trying to cut losses or take profits.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/vqOVOU82/" width="2475" /></p>

Impact On Investor Sentiment And Market Dynamics
<p>The recent price slump in BONK has had a notable impact on investor sentiment, with many adopting a cautious approach towards the token&#8217;s future prospects. This shift in sentiment has also influenced trading volumes and market activity, as investors reassess their positions and strategies in light of BONK&#8217;s price movements.</p>
Expert Price Predictions And Analysis
<p>As market observers examine BONK&#8217;s price predictions, varying outlooks emerge regarding its future performance. While some forecasts suggest a bearish scenario with a price of $0.000018 in 2024, others paint a more optimistic picture, projecting an average price of $0.000067 by April 17, 2024. These contrasting predictions highlight the volatility and unpredictability inherent in the cryptocurrency market.</p>

</ul>
<h2>XRP Price Regains Traction</h2>
<p>After a major decline, XRP price found support near the $0.5680 zone.

<p>The first key resistance is near $0.700, above which the price could rise toward the $0.7440 resistance. A close above the $0.7440 resistance zone could spark a strong increase. The next key resistance is near $0.7650. If the bulls remain in action above the $0.7650 resistance level, there could be a rally toward the $0.800 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.820 resistance.</p>
<h2>Another Decline?</h2>
<p>If XRP fails to clear the $0.6560 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.630 zone.</p>
<p>The next major support is at $0.600. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.600 level, the price might accelerate lower. In the stated case, the price could retest the $0.5680 support zone.</p>

<p>Immediate resistance is near the $66,000 level. There is also a short-term declining channel or a bullish flag forming with resistance at $66,200 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. The first major resistance could be $67,000.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bitcoin_ccceee.png?resize=1024%2C461"><img alt="Bitcoin Price" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-599129" height="461" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bitcoin_ccceee.png?resize=1024%2C461" width="1024" /></a></p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">BTCUSD on TradingView.com</a></p>
<p>If there is a clear move above the $67,000 resistance zone, the price could continue to gain strength. In the stated case, the price could even clear the $68,000 resistance zone in the near term. The next key resistance sits at $70,000.</p>
<h2>More Losses In BTC?</h2>
<p>If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $66,000 resistance zone, it could continue to move down. Immediate support on the downside is near the $64,500 level.</p>
<p>The first major support is $63,500. The next support sits at $62,000. If there is a close below $62,000, the price could start a drop toward the $61,200 level. Any more losses might send the price toward the $60,500 support zone in the near term.</p>
<p>Technical indicators:</p>
<p>Hourly MACD – The MACD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone.</p>
<p>Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now below the 60 level.</p>
<p>Major Support Levels – $64,500, followed by $63,500.</p>
<p>Major Resistance Levels – $66,000, $67,000, and $68,000.</p>

<title>Beyond Bitcoin ETFs: ‘There Are Other Players Controlling This Market’ – Says Analyst</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/beyond-bitcoin-etfs-there-are-other-players/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/beyond-bitcoin-etfs-there-are-other-players/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章指出比特币价格的波动受到ETF外部因素的影响，而非仅仅受到现货比特币交易所交易基金（ETF）的流动影响。尽管Grayscale的GBTC报告显示记录流出，比特币的市场表现仍然表现出韧性。联邦储备主席Jerome Powell的讲话提振了各类风险资产的投资，包括加密货币。此外，比特币供应在交易所的持续减少显示出投资者倾向于持有资产以期待未来价值增长。CryptoQuant的数据表明比特币需求自2020年以来一直超过供应，这有望在未来价格上涨。最后，即将到来的比特币减半事件可能进一步提高比特币价格。 <div>
<p>Recent observations by Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg, <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1770794190844129755?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">suggest</a> that the movements in Bitcoin&#8217;s price are influenced by factors beyond just the flows of spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs).</p>
<p>According to Balchunas, who shared his insights on X, &#8220;bigger forces at work&#8221; shape the largest <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/profit-taking-panic-short-term-bitcoin-holders/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">cryptocurrency&#8217;s valuation</a>. This indicates that the correlation between spot ETF flows and Bitcoin&#8217;s price action is less direct than some assume.</p>

<h2>The ETF Influence And Market Movements</h2>
<p>This analysis emerges amid a period of significant financial activity for Grayscale, which has seen substantial outflows, described by Balchunas as experiencing a &#8220;second wind&#8221; of departures.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Grayscale reported outflows of $281.57 million, marking a notable decrease in its Bitcoin holdings by more than 40% since the inception of spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 11.</p>
<p>This scenario highlights a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/planbs-bitcoin-forecast-a-journey-to-5-million/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">broader narrative</a> within the cryptocurrency investment sphere, where the relationship between ETF activities and Bitcoin&#8217;s market performance is complex and multifaceted.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Interesting is price of bitcoin still went up yesterday and yet it went down second half of last week when Ten saw net inflows = there are other players controlling this market. ETFs def a factor but bigger forces at work here.</p>
<p>— Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1770794190844129755?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">March 21, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Despite the record outflows from Grayscale&#8217;s GBTC, Bitcoin&#8217;s market behavior has shown resilience. The cryptocurrency recently exceeded the $67,000 mark before experiencing a slight retracement, currently trading at a price of $66,106.</p>
<img alt="Bitcoin price chart on TradingView.com" class="size-medium" height="1496" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/Qjfi0xXD/" width="2770" />
<p>This movement coincides with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/live-blog/2024-03-20/fomc-rate-decision-and-fed-chair-news-conference" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">comments</a> from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, which seemingly spurred a rally across various risk assets, including cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Powell&#8217;s reassurances regarding the outlook on rate cuts prompted a slight recovery in Bitcoin&#8217;s price, demonstrating how external economic factors and sentiments can impact cryptocurrency markets. It is worth noting that Bitcoin traded below $65,000 before the announcement.</p>
<h2>On-Chain Insights And Bitcoin Future Prospects</h2>
<p>Further deepening the analysis, Charles Edwards, a crypto analyst, recently suggested that pullbacks are common in Bitcoin&#8217;s bull runs, with corrections of around 30% within the realm of possibility.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">A normal Bitcoin bullrun pullback is 30%. Back in December, we were already in the longest winning streak in Bitcoin&#8217;s history. A 20% pullback here takes us to $59K. A 30% pullback would be $51K. These are all levels we should be comfortable expecting as possibilities.</p>
<p>— Charles Edwards (@caprioleio) <a href="https://twitter.com/caprioleio/status/1770049266532466783?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">March 19, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>In related news, data from the on-chain analysis platform CryptoQuant has recently indicated a nearly 40% reduction in Bitcoin&#8217;s supply on exchanges over the past four years.</p>
<p>This trend points towards a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/hold-your-horses-buying-the-crypto-dip-is-still-too-early-warns-top-analyst-heres-why/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">bullish sentiment</a> within the Bitcoin ecosystem, suggesting that investors are inclined to hold onto their assets in anticipation of future value increases.</p>
<p>Moreover, CryptoQuant&#8217;s <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/65f9a82a0d84564c5d5ce1b0-After-Selloff-Next-Steps-for-Traders-Review-of-Popular-On-Chain-Data" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">data</a> reveals that Bitcoin&#8217;s demand has consistently outstripped its supply since 2020, a trend that supports the asset&#8217;s value on the premise that scarcity enhances perceived value.</p>

<p>This dynamic is expected to intensify following the upcoming Bitcoin halving event, which will reduce the miners&#8217; supply by half, potentially leading to further increases in Bitcoin&#8217;s price.</p>

<title>MakerDAO Stakeholder-Focused Updates Drive MKR Price Up By 10%</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/maker-mkr/makerdao-stakeholder-focused-updates-drive-mkr-price-up-by-10/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/maker-mkr/makerdao-stakeholder-focused-updates-drive-mkr-price-up-by-10/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。MakerDAO的Blockchain协议(MKR)持续看到显著增长，市场表现良好。协议计划进行利率系统变更，包括降低稳定费率和DAI储蓄率。市值激增，显示强劲增长和积极表现。近期价格行动显示短期支撑点和阻力点。 <div>
<p>Blockchain protocol MakerDAO (MKR) continues to see significant gains, maintaining a strong <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/mkr/makerdao-secures-6-billion-for-treasury-bill-investments-as-mkr-dominates-2023/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">upward trend </a>throughout the year. MKR has seen significant growth of over 358%, accompanied by positive metrics reflecting increased adoption and usage of the protocol. </p>
<p>In addition, upcoming voting initiatives aim to further increase the platform&#8217;s benefits for its stakeholders.</p>
<h2>MakerDAO Announces Plans For Rate System Changes</h2>
<p>In a recent <a href="https://forum.makerdao.com/t/stability-scope-parameter-changes-11-under-sta-article-3-3/23910" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>, MakerDAO stated that it closely monitors developments in the cryptocurrency market and has gained a better understanding of the impact of recent proposals. </p>
<p>As a result, the protocol is recommending the next set of changes to its rate system. MakerDAO emphasized that further adjustments will likely be introduced shortly, contingent upon <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/makerdao-co-founder-cashes-out-sends-mkr-wobbling-after-4-5-million-sell/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">market dynamics</a>, such as prices, leverage demand, and the external rate environment encompassing centralized finance (CeFi) funding rates and decentralized (DeFi) effective borrowing rates. </p>

<p>The protocol further noted that the Maker rate system will be adjusted accordingly if the external rate environment continues to exhibit signs of decline.</p>
<p>Efforts are underway to update the rate system language within the Stability Scope, including developing a new iteration of the Exposure model. These updates aim to ensure that the system can adjust rates more gradually and effectively in the future.</p>
<p>Based on recommendations from BA Labs, a blockchain infrastructure provider, the Stability Facilitator proposes various <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/all/makerdao-mkr-recent-rally-signals-potential-for-new-highs-1700-on-the-horizon/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">parameter changes</a> to the Maker Rate system, which will be subject to an upcoming Executive vote. </p>
<img alt="MakerDAO" class="size-large wp-image-599117" height="373" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot_84.jpg?w=768&#038;resize=768%2C373" width="768" />
<p>As shown in the table above, the proposed changes include reducing the Stability Fee by 2 percentage points for various collateral types such as ETH-A, ETH-B, ETH-C, WSTETH-A, WSTETH-B, WBTC-A, WBTC-B, WBTC-C. In addition, the Dai Savings Rate (DSR) and the Effective DAI Borrowing Rate for Spark will also be reduced by 2 percentage points.</p>
<p>However, one active protocol user offered an alternative viewpoint, suggesting using the demand shock opportunity to expand the net interest margin. While agreeing with the proposed 2% interest <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/mkr/makerdao-explores-tokenized-t-bills-with-100-million-allocation-plan/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">rate reduction</a> for borrowers, the user advocates for a larger 4% reduction in the DSR, which he believes will further benefit MakerDAO&#8217;s net interest margin.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the outcome of the voting process will determine whether these proposed changes are implemented and benefit the stakeholders of MakerDAO. Further decisions regarding rates and fees will be made based on the results. </p>
<h2>Market Cap Skyrockets</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://tokenterminal.com/terminal/projects/makerdao" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">data </a>from Token Terminal, MakerDAO has demonstrated significant growth and positive performance across various key metrics over the past 30 days. </p>
<p>In terms of market capitalization, MakerDAO&#8217;s fully diluted market cap has reached approximately $3.07 billion, reflecting a notable increase of 40.9% over the past 30 days. The circulating market cap is around $2.82 billion, showing a similar growth rate of 41.1%.</p>
<img alt="MakerDAO" class="size-large wp-image-599118" height="269" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot_85.jpg?w=641&#038;resize=641%2C269" width="641" />
<p>On another note, the total value locked (TVL) in MakerDAO has increased by 10.1% over the past 30 days to approximately $7.05 billion. </p>
<p>The token <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/maker-mkr/makerdao-debates-new-edsr-optimization-plan-as-mkr-bears-retain-market-control/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">trading volume</a> for MakerDAO has surged 126.6% over the past month, reaching approximately $4.35 billion. This increase in trading volume suggests heightened market activity and interest in the protocol.</p>
<p>In terms of user activity, MakerDAO has seen an increase in daily active users, with an increase of 32.2% to 193 users. On the other hand, weekly active users decreased by 22.6% to 783 users. However, monthly active users have shown a positive growth rate of 10.0%, reaching 2.88k users.</p>
Short-Term Outlook For MKR
<p>Regarding price action, MKR is currently trading at $3,158, reflecting a 4.8% growth in the past 24 hours, 10% in the past seven days, and an impressive 49% increase in the past fourteen and thirty-day time frames.</p>
<p>The token has encountered a support wall for the short term at $3,048. This support level is significant for the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/maker-mkr/makerdao-massive-upgrade-a-new-era-for-defi/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">token&#8217;s growth prospects</a>. Another key support level is at $2,884, which further contributes to the token&#8217;s short-term stability and potential growth.</p>

<img alt="MakerDAO" class="size-large" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/ihfXssr7/" width="1815" />
<p>On the other hand, the nearest resistance level is observed at its 28-month high of $3,321. This level represents the highest point reached by the token since November 2021. </p>

<title>Bitcoin Brief Bounce Back Above $67,000: Triggers Nearly $300 Million In Total Liquidations</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。最近，加密市场经历了大规模的清算浪潮，近3亿美元被清理，紧随比特币突然升破67000美元的高点。液化导致了86047个交易者损失了超过2.5亿美元，短期交易占了57.55％，长期交易占了40％。比特币的迅速回升引发了对其未来的兴趣和前景。交易活动的复苏表明投资者信心正在增强，分析师预测2024年前后会出现两次比特币价格激增。<br /> <div>
<p>The crypto market has recently experienced a wave of liquidations, amounting to nearly $300 million, closely following Bitcoin&#8217;s sharp reclaim of the $67,000 mark.</p>
<p>This surge in <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/high-stakes-week-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum-as-central-bank-decisions-approach-key-predictions/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin&#8217;s value</a>, a stark reversal from its previous downtrend, caught many traders off guard, especially those who had placed bets on the continuation of the market&#8217;s decline.</p>

<h2>Over 80,000 Traders Faces Liquidation</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">data</a> provided by Coinglass sheds light on the magnitude of the liquidations, revealing that approximately 86,047 traders suffered losses exceeding $250 million within a mere 24-hour period.</p>
<p>Major exchanges like Binance, OKX, Bybit, and Huobi were the arenas for these significant financial setbacks, with Binance traders bearing the brunt of the liquidations.</p>
<p>Particularly, Binance recorded $128.7 million in<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crash-60800-worst-over-experts/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> liquidations</a>, while other major platforms such as OKX, Bybit, and Huobi also experienced significant liquidations, amounting to $99.87 million, $33.18 million, and $17.70 million, respectively. Meanwhile, despite also facing liquidations, the smaller exchanges had a comparatively minor impact.</p>
<p>Most affected positions were short trades, reflecting a widespread anticipation of a market downturn that did not materialize as expected. Short positions recorded an estimated 57.55% of the liquidations, equivalent to $164.10 million, from traders betting against the market.</p>
<p>On the flip side, long position holders also faced their share of losses, contributing to nearly 40% of the total liquidations, amounting to $121.07 million. </p>
<img alt="Crypto market liquidations heatmap." class="wp-image-599070 size-large" height="480" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-21-at-17.15.21.png?w=860&#038;resize=860%2C480" width="860" />
<h2>Bitcoin Recovery And Future Prospects</h2>
<p>The sharp recovery of Bitcoin, momentarily reclaiming highs above $67,000, has reignited interest in its<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-turns-red-62k/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> market behavior</a> and future trajectory.</p>
<img alt="Bitcoin price chart on TradingView" class="size-medium" height="1496" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/zHdl5IZM/" width="2770" />
<p>Despite a 6.6% dip in its market capitalization over the past week, Bitcoin&#8217;s value saw a notable 6% increase in the last 24 hours, with its market cap presently sitting above $140 billion. This resurgence in trading activity, with daily volumes climbing from below $60 billion to heights above this mark, signifies renewed investor confidence and heightened <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-halving-retrace-investors/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">trading interest</a>.</p>
<p>Adding to the discourse, cryptocurrency analyst Willy Woo presents an optimistic outlook for Bitcoin, suggesting the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-might-be-poised-for-a-double-pump/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">possibility of a &#8220;double pump&#8221; cycle</a> reminiscent of the market patterns observed in 2013.</p>
<p>According to Woo, this pattern could herald two significant price surges for Bitcoin in the coming years, with the first peak anticipated by mid-2024 and a subsequent, more substantial rise in 2025.</p>

<p>While such dual surge scenarios are rare, Woo&#8217;s analysis, based on current market conditions and Bitcoin&#8217;s growth potential, offers a glimpse into the future of the world&#8217;s leading cryptocurrency.</p>

<title>Crypto Analyst Says XRP Price Is Headed For $27 As 2017 Pattern Emerges</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-headed-for-27/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-headed-for-27/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。加密货币分析师EGRAG CRYPTO预测XRP将呈现2017年的模式，并预测价格可能会增长超过4,300％。他指出20和50 Simple Moving Averages交叉，类似于历史模式。分析显示，这种交叉在XRP历史上只发生过两次，分别为‘Cycle A’和‘Cycle B’。他预测当前‘Cycle C’可能会像‘Cycle A’那样快速上涨，目标价为$27。Coinbase计划在期货合约中引入狗狗币。虽然XRP价格最近下跌，但如果突破$0.6支撑价位，可能会出现新的变化。 <div>
<p>Popular crypto analyst EGRAG CRYPTO, known for his very bullish stance on XRP, has predicted that the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/all/xrp-records-massive-80-surge-in-trading-volume-can-price-reach-a-new-ath/">XRP price is headed for $27</a> as a pattern from 2017 emerges again. The analyst made this prediction known in a recent post on social media to reflect that XRP is now mimicking a historical cross between the 20 and 50 Simple Moving Averages.</p>
<p>Interestingly, with XRP currently trading at $0.6079 amidst a lull market gain, EGRAG’s prediction represents a surge of over 4,300% from the current price levels. </p>
<h2>Analyst Points To Similarities Between 2017 And Current Market Conditions</h2>
<p>A detailed look into EGRAG&#8217;s technical analysis points to a cross between the 20 SMA and 50 SMA, with the former crossing above the latter. Interestingly, this cross dates 50 bars on the weekly candlestick time frame, around 350 days ago. </p>
<p>Now, he pointed out that this scenario has only happened twice throughout XRP&#8217;s history with two different outcomes, and XRP could now go on the path of either outcome or it could play out something new in the coming days.</p>

<p>The historical data reveals two crosses between the Yellow Line (20 SMA) and Blue Line (50 SMA).</p>
<p>A) If this resembles Cycle &#8216;A&#8217;, then we could expect a rapid and aggressive price surge, akin to a rocket… <a href="https://t.co/o8PVCqJP14" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/o8PVCqJP14</a></p>
<p>— EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) <a href="https://twitter.com/egragcrypto/status/1770029296091853054?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">March 19, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>American publicly traded company and crypto exchange, Coinbase has revealed plans to introduce Dogecoin (DOGE) in its futures contract offerings.</p>
<p>The first time this type of cross happened between the two moving averages was in 2017. However, the price of XRP continued to consolidate for 49 weekly bars before going on a rapid and aggressive price surge to reach its current all-time high of $3.84. EGRAG called this &#8216;Cycle A&#8217;, likening the price action to a &#8220;rocket ship-style pump.&#8221;</p>
<p>The second time this type of cross occurred was in 2021. In this cycle, which he called &#8216;Cycle B,&#8217; XRP went on a smaller consolidation for 32 bars before going on a lesser price surge than that of Cycle B. EGRAG believes that the current cycle, which he called &#8220;Cycle C,&#8221; mirrors that of Cycle A more than Cycle B, as there are no evident similarities in the patterns between the 20 SMA and 50 SMA. </p>
<p>EGRAG, in his continuous spirit of ultra-bullishness, forecasted that the current cycle might break out by a factor of 10 times bigger than the one that was seen in Cycle A, which would indicate a target of $27. </p>
<h2>What’s Next For XRP Price?</h2>
<p>EGRAG is one of the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/get-ready-for-liftoff-xrp-set-for-20-surge-against-bitcoin-predicts-analyst/">few crypto analysts</a> who are <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/why-xrp-price-rise-1700-to-10/">still optimistic about</a> XRP&#8217;s future. In a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-surge-crypto-analyst-predicts-various-bullish-scenarios-in-the-coming-days/">former analysis made</a> in December 2023, he noted <a href="https://x.com/egragcrypto/status/1740997422153662693?s=20" rel="nofollow">various scenarios</a> of how XRP could surge past $1 in the first quarter of 2024 amidst a bull run ushered in by Spot Bitcoin ETFs.</p>

<p> Although the introduction of these ETFs undoubtedly attracted capital to the cryptocurrency space and <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/breaking-news-ticker/breaking-bitcoin-hits-new-all-time-high-surging-past-70000-for-the-first-time-in-history/">propelled Bitcoin</a> to yet a new record high, XRP&#8217;s price hasn&#8217;t increased all that much.</p>
<p>XRP crossed over $0.73 on March 11 for the first time since November 2023 but has been on a downfall since then with the formation of lower highs and lower lows. However, things could <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-on-the-crosshair-as-trading-begins-on-us-backed-exchange/">change into a strong bullish momentum</a> very soon if XRP <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-prediction-0-5850/">bulls continue to hold</a> above the $0.6 price support. </p>

<title>Bitcoin Surging But Likely To Consolidate Before Breaking $74,000: Analyst</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-consolidate-breaking-74000/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-consolidate-breaking-74000/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章指出比特币在3月19日回升后将会继续上涨，但可能会在未来几天内巩固。分析师指出，Spent Output Profit Ratio（SOPR）达到异常高的水平，可能会导致利润回吐和价格横盘。然而，历史数据显示，比特币在前减半周期出现的20%下跌相对较轻。此外，宏观风险信号上升为正面迹象，暗示价格可能会反弹至新高。最后，分析师认为比特币巩固时，其他代币可能会上涨，并提示杠杆交易者注意预期的波动。 <div>
<p>After capitulating on March 19, Bitcoin recovered on March 20. However, while the crypto community expects more rapid gains, even above the all-time highs of around $73,800, Willy Woo, an on-chain analyst, <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1770768655078346960" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">thinks</a> the coin will likely consolidate in the days ahead.</p>
<h2>SOPR Peaked At An Unusually High Level: Profit-Taking?</h2>
<p>Taking to X, Woo listed several on-chain metrics, some of which, while supporting prices, are countered by others that might slow down the uptrend. At the top of the list, the analyst notes how the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR) reading is printed out. </p>

<p>The SOPR is used to measure the profitability of Bitcoin transactions. When it is, it suggests that more BTc being moved around are in green. While this reading has risen in the past few trading weeks, how it peaked is a concern. </p>
<img alt="Bitcoin SOPR peaking | Source: Willy Woo on X" class="size-full wp-image-599054" height="854" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GJL72GEXkAA8QmB.jpg?resize=1024%2C854" width="1024" />
<p>In Woo&#8217;s assessment, there is likely profit-taking since the SOPR peaked at an unusually &#8220;high level.&#8221; Accordingly, profit-taking translates to holders exiting, which means selling on the spot, possibly resulting in a sideways consolidation.</p>
<p>However, the analyst finds reasons for optimism. Specifically, the recent fall from the swing high, at around $73,800, was around 20%. This dip tends to be more severe compared to historical cycles and, more importantly, before halving. </p>
<p>The analyst said it fell by over 30% in the last cycle before halving in 2020. </p>
<p>Additionally, the analyst views the current rise in &#8220;Macro risk signal,&#8221; a metric that compares inflows to risky asset prices like Bitcoin and crypto, as a positive sign. Even though it is rising and bullish, it may &#8220;freak out&#8221; investors, shaking out some before prices rally to new levels. </p>
<h2>Bitcoin To Consolidate, Altcoins To Pump?</h2>
<p>What&#8217;s happening to Bitcoin might also impact altcoins and leverage traders. Specifically, the analyst thinks that altcoins will likely pump as Bitcoin consolidates in a technically bullish structure. </p>
<p>Even so, by Woo&#8217;s assessment, the fact that leverage ratios on perpetual swap bets haven&#8217;t been reset means traders should be careful because of the expected volatility tagging position adjustments.</p>

<p>While Woo is bullish, predicting possible choppy price action in April, traders are bullish. Considering the recent wave of institutional demand, Halving might drive prices higher in the coming sessions.</p>

<p>Presently, BTC bulls have reversed losses of March 19. The coin is trading above the 20-day moving average. Optimistic traders look at $73,800 as the short- to medium-term target.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Cash (BCH) Surges 15% As Coinbase Plans Futures Listing</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-cash/bitcoin-cash-bch-15-coinbase-futures-listing/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-cash/bitcoin-cash-bch-15-coinbase-futures-listing/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。Coinbase计划在4月1日推出比特币现金期货产品，并已向商品期货交易委员会提交了三种数字货币的认证：比特币现金、狗狗币和莱特币。这些数字货币在过去24小时内出现了尖锐的涨幅，特别是比特币现金，涨幅达到了15%。这一涨势可能受到Coinbase填报的新闻的影响。比特币现金在目前的市值排名中位居第17位，表现出色。 <div>
<p>Bitcoin Cash (BCH) has registered a sharp 15% rally in the past 24 hours after plans of a futures listing on Coinbase have surfaced for the asset.</p>
<h2>Coinbase Plans To Launch Bitcoin Cash Futures Product On 1 April</h2>
<p>As an X user has pointed out, the cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-ascent-to-64000-causes-coinbase-to-crash-heres-what-happened/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Coinbase</a> appears to have filed certifications with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to list futures products for three coins on its platform: Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Litecoin (LTC).</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Coinbase Derivatives LLC quietly filed certifications with CFTC to list US regulated futures for Dogecoin, Litecoin and Bitcoin Cash.</p>
<p>They filed them on March 7 and surprisingly nobody seemed to notice.</p>
<p>Futures are set to start trading on April 1 if there are no objections from… <a href="https://t.co/DYbWjuS6G2" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/DYbWjuS6G2</a></p>
<p>— Summers (@SummersThings) <a href="https://twitter.com/SummersThings/status/1770534349349240873?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">March 20, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>As per the CFTC filing, all of these products were certified on March 7, and they are set to go live on trading on the first of the month.</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Cash Futures" class="alignnone wp-image-599028 size-full aligncenter" height="475" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/data.png?resize=1023%2C475" width="1023" /></p>

<p>Interestingly, all three of these digital assets happen to be based on the original cryptocurrency: Bitcoin. Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart has hinted that this may be why Coinbase has chosen them.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">This is interesting&#8230; wonder if the SEC objects to these being classified &#8216;commodities futures&#8217; vs &#8216;securities futures&#8217;. These all forked from Bitcoin so &#8220;these are securities&#8221; claims would be hard to make after spot <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">#Bitcoin</a> ETF approvals. Might be why Coinbase chose them<img alt="🤔" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f914.png" style="height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/PRCxzQEYbi" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/PRCxzQEYbi</a></p>
<p>— James Seyffart (@JSeyff) <a href="https://twitter.com/JSeyff/status/1770539658029461834?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">March 20, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Unlike LTC and DOGE, which are based initially on BTC&#8217;s code, BCH is a direct fork of the cryptocurrency made to fulfill BTC&#8217;s original purpose as a fast and cheap form of currency that may be used for regular purposes (hence the name).</p>
<p>The filling made by Coinbase on Bitcoin Cash reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>The market position of Bitcoin Cash reflects its role as an alternative to Bitcoin that prioritizes transaction efficiency. While it has not matched Bitcoin in terms of market capitalization or price, Bitcoin Cash has established itself as a significant player in the cryptocurrency space, with a dedicated user base and ecosystem.</p></blockquote>
<h2>BCH Has Enjoyed A 14% Surge During The Last 24 Hours</h2>
<p>The cryptocurrency sector has been up in the past day, but two coins in particular have stood out among the top 20 assets by <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/1-3-trillion-bitcoin-market-cap-sets-new-record-all-time-high/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">market cap</a>: Bitcoin Cash and Dogecoin.</p>
<p>Both of these have managed more than 14% returns in this period, notably outperforming their peers. Bitcoin itself has only been able to put together a rally of about 6%.</p>
<p>Given that the Coinbase filling has been making the rounds in this window, it would appear likely that it was at least partially responsible for the extraordinary surges of these coins.</p>
<p>Even though Litecoin is also planned to see its futures contract launch on the same day as the other two, its price performance has been more or less in line with the rest of the market with its profits sitting at just 4%.</p>

<p>Following the sharp rally, Bitcoin Cash has now arrived at the $424 level. The chart below shows how the cryptocurrency&#8217;s trajectory has looked in the last few days.</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Cash Price Chart" class="alignnone size-medium aligncenter" height="854" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/tqnytLzY/" width="1534" /></p>

<p>Regarding the market cap, Bitcoin Cash is currently the 17th largest asset. While there is some distance to Polygon (MATIC) in 16th place, LTC may be able to catch it if it can keep up this rally.</p>

<title>Crypto Expert Reveals The Possibility Of Bitcoin Reaching $500,000</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/crypto-expert-bitcoin-500000/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/crypto-expert-bitcoin-500000/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章提到了多位加密货币专家对比特币价格走势的乐观预测，包括有人认为比特币可能达到50万美元，甚至100万美元的预测。专家们表示，尽管在本牛市中可能会发生重大价格调整，但这并不会影响长期投资者。此外，他们指出随着比特币减半事件的临近，供应将受到限制，价格有望获得支撑。目前比特币价格在67300美元左右交易。 <div>
<p>Crypto experts and analysts have <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-100000-cardano-dead/#:~:text=Why%20Cardano%20Is%20Dead,non%2Dexistent%E2%80%9D%20on%20it.">given their opinions</a> on how Bitcoin could rise in this bull cycle, with some opining that the flagship crypto token could rise <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-demands-exceeds-supply/">to as high as $237,000</a>. Now, this crypto expert has given a more ambitious price prediction, raising the possibility of Bitcoin hitting $500,000. </p>
<h2>Bullish Sentiment Shows Bitcoin Can Reach $500,000</h2>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-150000-40-correction/" rel="nofollow">Crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe</a> mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1760249488415879234?s=20" rel="nofollow">post</a> that the likelihood of BTC reaching $500,000 long-term is “definitely there.” He based this assertion on the “overly bullish sentiment,” which he noted is great for Bitcoin. </p>

<p>On the road to $500,000, Michaël van de Poppe noted that “corrections will happen and they will be rough.” However, he believes this shouldn’t deter investors but serve as a “giant buying opportunity,” especially when <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/goldman-sachs-remains-bullish-on-bitcoin/" rel="nofollow">BTC corrects 20% or more</a>. This has been the case with <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/microstrategy-bitcoin-bet-btc/" rel="nofollow">Michael Saylor’s MicroStrategy</a>, which has continued to buy on Bitcoin dips and now holds <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/microstrategy-1-of-all-bitcoin/" rel="nofollow">1% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply</a>.  </p>
<p>Interestingly, a pseudonymous crypto analyst (Bitcoin Munger) also <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-targets-500000-scary-dips/" rel="nofollow">recently shared</a> their Bitcoin target of $500,000. Unlike Michaël van de Poppe, who didn’t provide a specific time frame, this analyst hinted at Bitcoin hitting this price level by mid-2025. Meanwhile, Bitcoin Munger echoed Michaël van de Poppe’s sentiment, stating there will be many “scary drops along the way.”</p>
<p>Significant price corrections in this bull cycle look inevitable, and different crypto analysts have continued to emphasize this point. <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/pro-xrp-lawyer-threat-crypto/" rel="nofollow">Alex Thorn</a>, Head of Research at Galaxy Digital, also <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crash-10-69000/">mentioned</a> that corrections are expected as the market doesn&#8217;t move to the upside unfettered, even in a bull market. </p>
<h2>The Most Ambitious BTC Price Prediction Yet</h2>
<p>So far, the most ambitious Bitcoin price prediction is still from Jan3 CEO and Bitcoiner <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/expert-forecasts-bitcoin-swift-rise-to-1-million/" rel="nofollow">Samson Mow</a>. Mow <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-reach-1-million/">predicts</a> that BTC could hit $1 million this year. He alluded to the imbalance <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-demands-exceeds-supply/">between BTC&#8217;S demand and supply</a>, which is why he believes the flagship crypto token can reach such heights. </p>

<p>Mow believes that Bitcoin’s price will “react accordingly” as demand for the crypto token outpaces miners’ supply. This supply will be <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-supply-shock-57-of-btc-hasnt-moved-2-years/" rel="nofollow">cut in half</a> when the Halving event takes place in April. The aftermath of the event can create a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/major-issue-spot-bitcoin-etfs/" rel="nofollow">potential scarcity for BTC</a>, which will undoubtedly help drive its price up. However, BTC at $1 million still looks unimaginable. </p>
<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $67,300, up over 7% in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.</p>

<title>Are Arbitrum Investors Still Selling Off? Analysts Remain Bullish On ARB As Price Surges 5.2%</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章讨论了Arbitrum（ARB）的最新发展，包括1.1亿ARB代币的释放以及投资者在交易所上的抛售行为。尽管投资者出售大量ARB代币，但分析师对ARB和市场的看涨趋势持乐观态度。ARB价格经历了波动，但最近显示出反弹迹象，可能会迎来一波上涨。当前价格为$1.76，年初以来上涨了29.4%。 <div>
<p class="p1">Arbitrum (ARB), the Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) scaling solution, recently went through an <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/arbitrum/arbitrum-arb-faces-potential-selling-pressure-as-1-billion-tokens-become-unlocked-in-march/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">unlocking event</a> as part of its 2024 roadmap. However, the event raised concerns about how the token’s price would react amid the market slowdown. </p>


<p class="p1">It’s been a week since Bitcoin’s price started to dip. Despite BTC’s recovery, the market still exhibits red numbers. Crypto analysts remain optimistic about ARB and the market’s bullish run. </p>





<h2 class="p1">Are Arbitrum Whales Still Dumping On Exchanges? </h2>


<p class="p1">The event on March 16 unlocked 1.1 billion ARB tokens. These tokens were distributed among the team, advisors, and investors, who received 438.25 million ARB, approximately 40% of the total tokens unlocked. </p>


<p class="p1">Since then, Arbitrum whales have dumped millions of ARB on exchanges. As <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/arbitrum/arbitrum-token-sell-off-whales-transfer-58m-to-exchanges-following-unlock-arb-price-reacts/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">reported</a> by NewsBTC, eleven whales recently sent over $58 million worth of the token to different trading venues. </p>


<p class="p1">Yesterday, the trend continued as two ARB whales sent around $12.72 million worth of ARB to the Binance exchange. These whales are seemingly investors who received around 28.43 million ARB tokens during the unlock.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">::on-chain insights::<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ARB&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">$ARB</a> investors are selling their tokens:</p>

<p></p>


<p class="p1">As reported by an X user, the first wallet received 19.845 million ARB on March 16. This whale sent 3 ARB to Binance as a test before offloading 3.9 million tokens worth $6.9 million.</p>


<p class="p1">The second whale sent 3.424 million ARB tokens to Binance yesterday in two transactions, accounting for $5.79 million. Out of the 28 million tokens these investors received during Arbitrum’s unlock, the wallets now only hold 804,000 ARB, worth around $1.42 million. </p>


<h2 class="p1">Analysts Foresee Leg Up For ARB</h2>


<p class="p1">Arbitrum’s most recent downward trajectory started right before the unlocking event. After ARB’s price failed to maintain the $2 support level, the token dropped over 30% to trade around $1.48 on March 19. </p>


<p class="p1">Since then, ARB has started to rise and retest its resistance levels again. According to crypto analyst World Of Charts, ARB <a href="https://x.com/worldofcharts1/status/1770392700795211836?s=46" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">broke</a> a bullish flag on March 20. </p>


<p class="p1">Successfully retesting the $1.64 price range could potentially bring a “40-45% Bullish Wave,” per the analyst.</p>

<p></p>


<p class="p1">ARB’s retest above the suggested price range succeeded in the following hours. The token rose to the $1.8 mark in the early hours of today before returning to the $1.75 price range.  </p>


<p class="p1">Crypto analyst Bluntz projected a leg up for Arbitrum after the price neared the $1.8 resistance level. As the analyst highlighted, ARB’s price performance shows an a,b, and c zigzag pattern that could suggest an upward trajectory for the token. Additionally, he expressed optimism about the market’s health based on the token’s performance.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p></p>


<p class="p1" style="text-align: left;">ARB is trading at $1.76 at writing time, representing a 5.2% increase in the last 24 hours. Although it shows a 14% and 12% decrease in the weekly and monthly timeframes, its current price still represents a 29.4% <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/arbitrum/arbitrum-beats-ethereum-and-solana-with-119-surge-in-nft-sales-nft-resurgence-on-the-horizon/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">surge</a> since the year began.

<title>US Spot Bitcoin ETFs Experience Record Outflows, Losing $740 Million In Three Days</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章指出，比特币ETF经历了自1月份推出以来最大的三天资金流出，尽管投资者情绪发生了变化，但总体表现仍然值得关注。投资者从Grayscale比特币信托中撤出了巨额资金，但该信托仍然在收入排行榜中处于领先位置。尽管亚洲市场的表现与全球股市和黄金持续上涨形成对比，但著名加密货币分析师预测比特币将迎来“巨额反弹”，显示出对其上升轨迹持乐观态度。虽然ETF市场持续流出资金，但比特币持续显示出稳定的增长趋势。 <div>
<p>The 10 spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced their biggest three-day outflow since their debut in January, as <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-21/us-spot-bitcoin-btc-etfs-post-largest-three-day-outflow-since-launch" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reported </a>by Bloomberg. This shift in investor sentiment comes after heightened interest that propelled the largest cryptocurrency in the market to a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/breaking-news-ticker/breaking-bitcoin-hits-new-all-time-high-surging-past-70000-for-the-first-time-in-history/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">record high of $73,700</a>.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin ETFs See Record Outflows</h2>
<p>Between Monday and Wednesday, a net total of $742 million exited the Bitcoin ETFs, reflecting outflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and a moderation in subscriptions for similar offerings from prominent firms like BlackRock (IBIT) and Fidelity Investments (FBTC).</p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/EricBalchunas/status/1770793028631888207?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">According </a>to Bloomberg ETF expert Eric Balchunas, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust has experienced a notable outflow surge. This recent development indicates a &#8220;second wind&#8221; of investor <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-pullback-has-ended-analyst-declares-worst-is-over/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">withdrawals</a>, with a substantial $1.4 billion leaving the trust just this week. </p>
<img alt="Bitcoin ETFs " class="size-large wp-image-599066" height="323" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GJMC9d2WcAE8N2v.png?w=593&#038;resize=593%2C323" width="593" />
<p>Notably, these withdrawals have surpassed all other ETFs in year-to-date outflows and set a new record for cumulative outflows in ETF history, as shown in the chart above.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, GBTC continues to hold a prominent position in terms of revenue generation. It currently ranks third out of the 3,400 ETFs available, demonstrating its continued financial success.</p>
<p>Despite the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-hindrance-75000-high/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">recent outflows</a>, the overall performance of these funds remains noteworthy, with net inflows of $11.4 billion recorded since their launch, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. This signifies one of the most successful debuts for an ETF category.</p>
<h2>Crypto Analyst Predicts &#8220;Massive Bounce&#8221; For BTC</h2>
<p>Bitcoin experienced a significant surge of over 5% in the United States on Wednesday, propelled by signals from the Federal Reserve (Fed) hinting at potential <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-traders-capitulate-what-last-2-times/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">interest-rate cuts</a>. </p>
<p>However, the Asian market painted a different picture on Thursday, with Bitcoin losing momentum compared to continued gains in global stocks and gold. According to Bloomberg, the news of outflows from Bitcoin ETFs permeated markets, contributing to the contrasting performance.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, renowned crypto analyst Michael van de Poppe shared a bold prediction on social media platform X (formerly Twitter). In his <a href="https://x.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1770718547380974005?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, he expressed optimism about a &#8220;massive bounce&#8221; for Bitcoin, suggesting the potential for a continuation of its upward trajectory. </p>
<p>Van de Poppe also predicted that Bitcoin could consolidate in the near term before embarking on another rally towards the all-time high it reached before the halving event, which is expected to begin sometime in April.</p>
<img alt="Bitcoin ETFs" class="size-large" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/HnpcrjxY/" width="1815" />
<p>Currently, BTC is trading at $66,200, reflecting a 4% increase in the past 24 hours despite ongoing outflows in the ETF market. Over longer time frames, Bitcoin has shown consistent gains, with a 27% increase over the past thirty days and an impressive 136% gain year-to-date.</p>

<title>Don’t Panic: The Bitcoin Bull Market Is Far From Over, Quant Says</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-bull-market-far-from-over/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-bull-market-far-from-over/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的<br />
1. Ki Young Ju表示比特币牛市还未结束，展望了未来发展。
2. 据Realized Cap数据显示，比特币的四个年龄段的趋势表明潜在增长。
3. 成功的网络实施是比特币创下新高的主要动力，而不是即将到来的ETF事件。
4. 预测如果发生30%的最大回撤，比特币可能会下跌50%。
5. 零售投资者仍在逐渐涌入市场，尚未达到“比特币狂热”的高峰。<br /> <div>
<p>Amidst the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crash-60800-worst-over-experts/">recent Bitcoin pullback</a> from its previous all-time high above $73,000, Ki Young Ju, the founder and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Crypto Quant, <a href="https://x.com/ki_young_ju/status/1770284065880727681?s=46" rel="nofollow">reassures</a> the broader crypto community that the BTC<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/founder-btc-bitcoin-bull-run-just-getting-started/" rel="nofollow"> bull market is far from over</a>. </p>
<h2>Bitcoin Bulls Are Not Done</h2>
<p>In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, Ju expressed strong bullish sentiment regarding Bitcoin, highlighting factors that suggest that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bull-market-huge-bubble/" rel="nofollow">Bitcoin’s upward trajectory is likely to continue</a>. The Crypto Quant CEO shared a crucial indicator depicted in a price chart, showcasing the percentage of Realized Cap across four age bands for BTC. </p>

<p>According to data from the price chart, the observed trends from the Realized Cap of four age bands from 6 months to three years indicate a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/coinbase-bitcoin-bull-run-2024/" rel="nofollow">positive outlook for BTC in 2024. </a></p>
<p>Additionally, the CEO has <a href="https://x.com/ki_young_ju/status/1770074028134580527?s=46" rel="nofollow">stated</a> that the primary catalyst behind Bitcoin’s rise to new all-time highs is the success of the<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/without-spot-bitcoin-etfs-btc-down-20-founder/" rel="nofollow"> Spot Bitcoin ETF</a>, rather than the upcoming <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-halving-and-spot-etfs-the-impending-btc-supply-shock/" rel="nofollow">Bitcoin halving</a> event in April. </p>
<p>After the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-cap-1-trillion-spot-etfs-launch-cryptoquant/">introduction of Spot Bitcoin ETFs</a>, BitcoBTCin embarked on an exponential rally, reaching heights not witnessed since its previous bull run in 2021. The cryptocurrency rose to record highs, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-whale-217-million-profit-btc-73000/">surpassing $73,000 </a>previously, but experienced a major pullback of about 8.33% over the past week. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price is below $70,000, trading at $67,225, according to CoinMarketCap.</p>
<p>Ju has revealed <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-drop-prices-remain-below-70300/" rel="nofollow">possibilities for even more declines</a>, predicting a potential price drop of 50% for the cryptocurrency if a maximum drawdown of 30% occurs. The CEO has stated that for this event to happen, new whales, particularly ETF buyers, will have to enter the Bitcoin market at $56,000 on average. </p>
<p>While this outlook may seem bleak, the Crypto Quant founder has also <a href="https://x.com/ki_young_ju/status/1767875533243847035?s=46" rel="nofollow">expressed</a> strong belief in the continuation of the BTC bull market, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-suffers-crash-to-65000/">contingent upon the sustained momentum of ETF inflows.  </a></p>
<h2>Retail Investors Still Making Their Way Into The Market</h2>
<p>Reinforcing his belief that “Bitcoin is still in the middle of the bull cycle,” Ju asserts that the cryptocurrency’s <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-top-when-bull-run-peak-past-pattern/">cyclic top</a> has not yet been breached. The CEO <a href="https://x.com/ki_young_ju/status/1770057255716868353?s=46" rel="nofollow">suggested</a> that more price upswings were still set for Bitcoin, as retail investors have not fully entered the market yet.  </p>

<p>According to the Crypto Quant founder, only 50% of retail investors have <a href="https://x.com/ki_young_ju/status/1767336678820344256?s=46" rel="nofollow">entered</a> the market, indicating the halfway point towards “Bitcoin euphoria”. This suggests that if more retail investors flood the market, BTC could potentially rise to new peaks, driven by increased demand and capital inflows. </p>
<p>Echoing Ju’s convictions about Bitcoin’s long-term price increase, Bitcoin analyst Willy Woo encourages investors to <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-pre-halving-btc-rally-us-fed-decision/">embrace the dip</a> during the present consolidation phase. The analyst confidently <a href="https://x.com/woonomic/status/1769540830329716892?s=46" rel="nofollow">asserts</a> that “this is not the top,” but rather a simple period of consolidation reminiscent of previous all-time highs. </p>

<title>Crypto Analyst Touts Base As Next Memecoin Hotspot: Top 8 Picks</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/crypto-analyst-base-next-memecoin-hotspot-top-8/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/crypto-analyst-base-next-memecoin-hotspot-top-8/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />在文章中，加密货币分析师Xremlin指出Base成为memecoin爱好者和投资者的新兴中心，预测类似Solana的暴涨。他提到Coinbase与即将推出的产品将大幅降低新投资者的准入门槛，可能在Base平台上引发memecoin的暴涨。然而，分析师也警告跟随者要谨慎投资，因为memecoin投资涉及高风险。他列出了Base上的一些顶级加密memecoin，包括TOSHI、DEGEN、DOGINME、MOCHI、PONCHO、TYBG、BRIUN和ELONRWA。最后，他强调社区和研究在导航memecoin市场中的重要性。 <div>
<p>In an analysis shared with his nearly 100,000 followers on X (formerly Twitter), the crypto analyst known by the pseudonym Xremlin (@0x_gremlin) has pinpointed Base as the burgeoning hub for memecoin enthusiasts and investors. This proclamation follows a season of unprecedented gains in the Solana memecoin market, with tokens like BOME, WIF, and SLERF achieving returns ranging from 300x to 1000x.</p>
<p>Xremlin&#8217;s insight into the crypto market dynamics suggests a potential replication of these astronomical returns on Base, underlined by a tweet stating, “Meme traders on Solana printed millions this season: <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/meme-coin/introducing-book-of-meme-bome-the-latest-1-billion-crypto-sensation/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">BOME</a>: 800x, WIF: 1000x, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/sponsored/slerf-price-prediction-the-next-200x-memecoin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">SLERF</a>: 300x. BASE season is just revving up, and might have a similar rally.”</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Meme traders on Solana printed millions this season:<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BOME&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">$BOME</a>: 800x │ <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24WIF&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">$WIF</a>: 1000x │ <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SLERF&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">$SLERF</a>: 300x<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BASE&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">$BASE</a> season is just revving up, and might have a similar rally.</p>
<p><img alt="🧵" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f9f5.png" style="height: 1em;" />List of memes on Base with 10-500x potential⭣ <a href="https://t.co/wAs5hde0N9" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/wAs5hde0N9</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Xremlin (@0x_gremlin) <a href="https://twitter.com/0x_gremlin/status/1770740023593210047?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">March 21, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>The transition of focus towards <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/optimism-2/op-is-undervalued-skyrocket-coinbase-base/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Base</a> is attributed by the analyst to its association with Coinbase and an upcoming product launch aimed at simplifying on-chain trading. Xremlin elaborates, &#8220;Why Base? Coinbase has a large user base in the US, but trading on-chain can be too complex for normies. Soon, Coinbase will launch a product that enables its CEX users [100M+] to trade on Base without requiring seed phrases or private keys.&#8221;</p>
<p>This move is anticipated to significantly lower the entry barriers for new investors, potentially catalyzing a memecoin rally on the Base platform.</p>

<p>However, amidst the excitement, Xremlin issues a word of caution to their followers: “Remember: Investing in memes is high risk. Only bet what you can afford to lose. Projects might rug, slow rug, or suddenly tank by 50%-70% when the hype fades.” This cautionary advice reflects the inherent volatility and risk associated with memecoin investments, where the line between significant gains and losses can be remarkably thin.</p>
<h2>Diving Into The Top Crypto Memecoins On Base</h2>
<p>Xremlin&#8217;s curated list of Base memecoins is not only varied but also rich with potential, highlighting projects inspired by cultural references, pets of notable figures, and even caricatures of industry leaders. Here&#8217;s a closer look at the analyst&#8217;s picks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TOSHI:</strong> Touted as a tribute to Brian Armstrong&#8217;s cat, named after the enigmatic Satoshi Nakamoto, TOSHI represents a playful investment opportunity. Xremlin notes, &#8220;TOSHI could be the flagship <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/press-releases/memecoin-mania-in-q4-2023-pepecoin-price-prediction-and-pikamoons-potential/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">memecoin</a> of Base, drawing on the crypto community&#8217;s reverence for Nakamoto and Armstrong&#8217;s influence.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>DEGEN:</strong> With its strategic distribution to Farcaster users, DEGEN taps into a community already engaged and familiar with crypto, setting a precedent for community-driven value.</li>
<li><strong>DOGINME:</strong> This memecoin capitalizes on the popular phrase &#8220;Got that dog in him,” embodying the resilience and tenacity celebrated in crypto trading circles.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>MOCHI and PONCHO:</strong> Both cat-themed coins seek to attract the attention of cat lovers, just as dog-themed memecoins such as Dogecoin, Shiba Inu and FLOKI attract that of dog lovers. MOCHI is based on Brian Armstrong&#8217;s pet.</li>
<li><strong>TYBG:</strong> Self-described as &#8220;The most based meme on Base,&#8221; it signifies the meta-culture of memes within the crypto space, where self-referential humor often garners substantial community support.</li>
<li><strong>BRIUN:</strong> A direct caricature of Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, BRIUN embodies the intersection of meme culture and crypto&#8217;s leadership, underlining the community&#8217;s penchant for satire.</li>
<li><strong>ELONRWA:</strong> Inspired by a sketch of Elon Musk, this project aims to bridge the gap between digital tokens and real-world assets, representing the innovative and often speculative nature of memecoin investments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Xremlin further emphasizes the importance of community and research in navigating the memecoin market: “For those interested in researching Base memes, I recommend joining the /base channel on Warpcaster. Community insight is invaluable, and collective due diligence can help mitigate risks associated with memecoin investments.”</p>
<p>At press time, TOSHI traded at $0.000321653, up 210% in the last three weeks.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Pullback Has Ended? Analyst Declares “Worst Is Over”</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-pullback-has-ended-analyst-declares-worst-is-over/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-pullback-has-ended-analyst-declares-worst-is-over/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章指出比特币价格已经触底，可能会出现上涨。分析师Crypto Jelle认为，比特币已经过去了最糟糕的时期，并预测价格将迅速恢复。同时，Crypto分析师Ali Martinez提出使用Dollar-Cost Averaging策略购买比特币的建议，根据特定价格水平购买不同数量的比特币。当前比特币价格为$67,299，日涨幅超过4%。市值增加4.97%，交易量下降12%。 <div>
<p>After a stunning retrace, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/why-is-bitcoin-price-up-today-key-reasons-explained/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin</a> witnessed a notable recovery as Wednesday closes rising from the $61,000 price mark to $67,000, triggering hopes within the cryptocurrency community that a bullish movement might be imminent. However, the crypto asset has not exactly returned to the point it was a week ago, especially since BTC reached a new all-time high last week when it surged beyond $73,000.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Correction Has Bottomed Out</h2>
<p>With Bitcoin surpassing its previous all-time high and rising even further to set a new peak of $73,000, March has been a momentous month for the cryptocurrency. And following the recent recovery, several cryptocurrency experts and traders believe that the recent<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crash-60800-worst-over-experts/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> price correction</a> has reached rock bottom.</p>

<p>Crypto analyst and enthusiast, Crypto Jelle has <a href="https://x.com/CryptoJelleNL/status/1770369529081627054?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">offered</a> a positive prediction regarding the price action of Bitcoin and its potential to move upward. His analysis delves into the current state of BTC&#8217;s price and the possibility of the retracement coming to an end.</p>
<p>According to Crypto Jelle, the average correction in &#8220;this bull market is almost 20%.&#8221; Meanwhile, the pullback is &#8220;roughly 18% deep&#8221; presently. As a result, Jelle believes that &#8220;we have most likely witnessed the worst of the drop,&#8221; suggesting that the price might be ready to undergo full recovery. </p>
<img alt="Bitcoin" class="size-medium wp-image-599022" height="236" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Crypto-Jelle-Bitcoin-Chart-1.jpg?w=460&#038;resize=460%2C236" width="460" />
<p>Jelle claims that the fall &#8220;should be bottoming out&#8221; any moment from now. However, this might not be happening soon, since &#8220;these things take time to form,&#8221; urging the crypto community not to rush it.</p>
<p>The post read:</p>
<blockquote><p>The average pullback in this bull market is almost 20%. Since the current downturn is just about 18% deep, the worst is most likely behind us. Although these things take time to form, the bottom should be close. Do not rust it.</p></blockquote>
<p>In another X <a href="https://x.com/CryptoJelleNL/status/1770557476183679264?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, Crypto Jelle noted that the market has once again begun to &#8220;display signs of a local bottom.&#8221; Due to this, the largest cryptocurrency asset <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/1-3-trillion-bitcoin-market-cap-sets-new-record-all-time-high/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">by market cap</a> still has &#8220;work to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Crypto Jelle anticipates Bitcoin to hold above the $65,300 threshold, in order for the price to &#8220;regain that 2021 bull cycle peak.&#8221; Additionally, when his forecast takes place, he believes that prices &#8220;will be off&#8221; in the upward direction in no time.</p>
<h2>Amount Of BTC To Buy Using DCA Strategy</h2>
<p>As Bitcoin continues to struggle, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has <a href="https://x.com/ali_charts/status/1770015684031840744?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">underlined</a> the amount of BTC to purchase within specific price levels using the Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) strategy.</p>

<p>According to Martinez, when BTC is within the range of $65,130, $64,130, $63,130, and $62,130, investors should buy 0.5 <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-whales-cashing-out/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">BTC</a>. Meanwhile, at the $61,130, $60,130, $59,130, and $58,130 levels, investors should acquire about 0.65 BTC.</p>
<p>Furthermore, around $57,130, $56,130, $55,130, and $54,130, Martinez advocates the acquisition of 0.8 BTC. Lastly, a portion of 0.95 BTC should be purchased around $53,130, $52,130, $51,130, and $50,130.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $67,299 on the daily timeframe, indicating an increase of over 4%. Its market cap has risen by 4.97% in the past day, while its trading volume is down by over 12%.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Faces One Major Hindrance To Reaching New $75,000 All-Time High</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-hindrance-75000-high/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-hindrance-75000-high/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。文章指出比特币面临一些挑战，尽管价格在过去一天出现了令人印象深刻的反弹。比特币ETF的资金流出继续增加，这是首次自1月份以来连续三天出现净流出。出现净流出的主要原因是投资者逃离由于高费用而不受欢迎的Grayscale基金。这种情况类似于1月份，当时SEC批准了比特币期货交易后，比特币价格也出现了下跌。当资金流出放缓时，比特币价格有望获得增长空间。当前比特币价格为67320美元，过去24小时增长了5.51%。 <div>
<p class="p2"><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-pre-halving-btc-rally-us-fed-decision/">Bitcoin is still struggling to reclaim its all-time high</a> even after staging an impressive recovery in the last day. The bounce up from $60,000 to $68,000 has no doubt reignited confidence in the market, but the cryptocurrency continues to face some challenges in its bid for a new all-time high.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Outflows Continue To Rock Bitcoin ETFs</h2>
<p class="p2">Over the last few months, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-etf-floodgates-just-opening-bitwise-cio/">Spot Bitcoin ETFs</a> have done very well when it comes to inflows, hitting record after record. This saw issues such as BlackRock garner a large number of coins in a short time, which contributed to the Bitcoin run to new all-time highs.</p>

<p class="p2">However, as the market gets used to the Spot Bitcoin ETFs being a part of daily investing, outflows have begun to rise. Mainly, these outflows have been from the Grayscale <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-etf-frenzy-blackrock-smashes-expectations-with-788-million-inflows-in-one-day/">Spot Bitcoin ETF</a> as investors flee from the fund due to their high fees. The same was the case back in January which triggered a crash in the market.</p>
<p class="p2">In the last few days, outflows have been dominating the ETF net flows. Data from Coinglass shows that net flows first turned negative at the start of the week on March 18, with $154.3 million flowing out of the funds. The next day, March 19, another $326.2 million left the funds, leading to higher negative flows than the previous day. Then, on March 20, net flows were negative once more, with $261.5 million leaving the funds.</p>
<p class="p2">This trend marks the first time since January that Spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen three consecutive days of outflows, which is in stark contrast to the previous week, which saw daily inflows hit a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-etfs-see-record-1-billion-inflows/">new all-time high of $1.04 billion on March 12</a>.</p>
<h2 class="p2">BTC Price Buckles Under Sell Pressure</h2>
<p class="p2">The sell pressure Bitcoin is shouldering right now is similar to the one seen in January right after the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had given the green light to <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-etf-frenzy-blackrock-smashes-expectations-with-788-million-inflows-in-one-day/">Spot Bitcoin ETFs</a> for trading. The <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-pre-halving-btc-rally-us-fed-decision/">BTC price</a> also suffered crashes during this time, dropping as low as $38,000.</p>

<p class="p2">However, the Bitcoin price had begun to pick up right after the Grayscale outflows slowed down, giving demand enough time to catch up with supply. Just like before, the outflows are being led by Grayscale and until the outflows slow down, BTC could continue to decline.</p>
<p class="p2">A turn in the tide from here, nevertheless, would give Bitcoin a lot of runway. A similar surge, as recorded after the outflows ended in January, would easily put the price past $75,000, which would be a new all-time high for cryptocurrency.</p>
<p class="p2">For now, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-pre-halving-btc-rally-us-fed-decision/">BTC</a> is trading at a $67,320, with a 5.51% increase in the last 24 hours.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Traders Capitulate: Here’s What Happened Last 2 Times</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-traders-capitulate-what-last-2-times/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-traders-capitulate-what-last-2-times/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />最近的链上数据显示比特币投资者最近一直在抛售，暴露市场上的恐慌情绪。比特币持有者总数最近出现了下降，表明有些投资者已经完全抛售他们的持仓。然而，历史数据表明，在类似的抛售事件发生后，比特币的价格有望出现正回报。比特币价格自$60,600低点开始了快速的复苏，目前价格已经上涨到$66,800水平。 <div>
<p>On-chain data shows the Bitcoin investors have been capitulating recently, a sign that FUD has been gripping the market.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Total Amount Of Holders Has Seen A Drop Recently</h2>
<p>According to data from the on-chain analytics firm <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1770675644030169307" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Santiment</a>, the Bitcoin Total Amount of Holders has registered a notable decline recently. The &#8220;<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-capitulation-holders-flee-btc-post-etf-hits/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Total Amount of Holders</a>&#8221; here is an indicator that measures the total number of addresses on the BTC blockchain that are carrying some non-zero balance right now.</p>
<p>When the value of this metric trends up, it can mean that fresh hands are potentially investing into the cryptocurrency, opening new addresses and adding coins to them.</p>

<p>The indicator would naturally also increase if any investors who had left the asset before are returning back to it and filling up their wallets again. Another possible reason for the trend can also be due to holders breaking up their holdings into multiple wallets, for purposes like privacy.</p>
<p>In general, though, an increase in the Total Amount of Holders is usually a sign that net <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-demand-doge-adoption-accelerating/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">adoption</a> of the coin is taking place, which can be a bullish sign in the long term.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a decline in the indicator can signal that some investors have decided to leave the cryptocurrency behind, as they have completely liquidated their holdings.</p>
<p>Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Total Amount of Holders over the past few months:</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Total Amount of Holders" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="1754" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GJKv2EMbAAAHLKb?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096" width="2649" /></p>

<p>As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Total Amount of Holders has suffered a decrease during the past 10 days or so. In all, 311,000 addresses have completely emptied themselves inside this window.</p>
<p>&#8220;To a novice trader, this may appear to be a concern with less overall active participants. However, historically this stat has reflected FUD moments in the market, indicating small BTC wallets are typically capitulating as large wallets scoop up their coins,&#8221; explains Santiment.</p>
<p>From the chart, it&#8217;s visible that there have also been two other instances of mass <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/xrp-traders-show-capitulation-why-could-bullish/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">capitulation</a> within the past few months. More specifically, 1.1 million addresses exited between the 23rd of September and 23rd of October, while 757,000 capitulated between the 21st of January and 13th of February.</p>
<p>Interestingly, during these capitulation events, the price went up 28% and 24%, respectively. So far since the latest selloff from the small hands has started, the cryptocurrency is down about 3%.</p>

<p>&#8220;If history is any indication, Bitcoin has a strong chance of putting up positive returns before this exodus of non-0 wallets this round (due to traders thinking the top is in) finally stops,&#8221; notes the analytics firm.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>Since Bitcoin&#8217;s low at $60,600, the asset has enjoyed some sharp recovery as its price has now surged to the $66,800 level.</p>

<title>Fantom (FTM) Bull Run: Can FTM Hit $2 After 20% Price Spike?</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/fantom-ftm-bull-run-can-ftm-hit-2-after-20-price-spike/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/fantom-ftm-bull-run-can-ftm-hit-2-after-20-price-spike/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章介绍了Fantom（FTM）加密货币的最新动向，包括其市值、交易量和价格走势。最近，Fantom宣布将验证程序的最低质押要求从50万FTM降至5万FTM，以鼓励生态系统的参与。社交兴趣增加，暗示价格涨势可能启动。分析表明Fantom的价格可能在2024年涨至$1.3951，预计价格有中等增长。 <div>
<p>Fantom (FTM), a cryptocurrency known for its high-speed smart contract platform, has been making headlines recently with its price movements and market predictions. </p>
<p>As of the latest data, Fantom is ranked #43 by market cap at $2.9 billion, with a trading volume of $863 million in the last 24 hours.<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/fantom/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> The current value of Fantom</a> stands at $1.06, reflecting an increase of 6.5% in the last 24 hours.</p>

<h2 class="text-lg mt-6 mb-2 first:mt-3"><strong>Recent Developments</strong></h2>
<p>Just recently, Fantom announced a significant reduction in the minimum staking requirements for validators from 500,000 FTM to 50,000 FTM. This move aimed to enhance participation and engagement within the Fantom ecosystem. </p>
<p>Despite facing challenges like a sell-off of assets and a hacking incident in 2023, Fantom managed to recover and close the year with a notable 130% increase in value.</p>
<h2 class="text-lg mt-6 mb-2 first:mt-3"><strong>Fantom: Social Interest Up</strong></h2>
<p>The increase in Fantom&#8217;s social volume indicated that the price surge had caused the cryptocurrency market to start talking about it. As the token&#8217;s weighted sentiment surged, so did bullish emotion surrounding it.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-598958" height="410" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_a77217.png?resize=1024%2C410" width="1024" /></p>



<p>Fantom&#8217;s network activity remained high as the token&#8217;s price gained positive momentum. According to NewsBTC&#8217;s examination of Artemis data, there were comparatively more daily active addresses on the blockchain last month.</p>
<strong>Bull Run Speculation</strong>
<p>Recent reports suggest that Fantom is gearing up for a potential bull run, fueled by the overall positive sentiment in the cryptocurrency market and the increasing demand for altcoins. </p>
<p>The price trend of Fantom indicates preparations for a bullish phase, aligning with the broader market movements that have seen Bitcoin surpassing the $70,000 mark. The anticipation of a bull run is further supported by a <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65fbcb91c763624f6b612fe8/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">120% rally in Fantom&#8217;s price in the last month</a>, hinting at a strong upward momentum.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/JEBsuBDF/" width="1835" /></p>

<strong>Price Outlook</strong>
<p>While the possibility of a bull run is on the horizon, the question of whether Fantom can hit $2 after a 20% price surge remains speculative. The current trajectory of Fantom&#8217;s price movement suggests a potential for growth, but reaching the $2 mark would require sustained positive market conditions and increased investor confidence. </p>
<p>Achieving such a milestone would signify a significant milestone for Fantom and could attract further attention to its platform and ecosystem.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an analytical forecast provided by Anton Kharitonov, a Traders Union analyst, suggests a <a href="https://tradersunion.com/currencies/forecast/fantom/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">relatively optimistic outlook</a> for the price of Fantom (FTM) by the end of 2024.</p>

<p>Kharitonov anticipates FTM reaching $1.3951. However, it&#8217;s important to note that this forecast is not isolated, as it aligns with the expectations of other TU analysts, who project a range of $1.2556 to $1.5346 for FTM&#8217;s price by the end of the same year.</p>

<p>This analysis indicates a consensus among TU analysts that Fantom&#8217;s price will likely experience moderate growth throughout 2024. The range provided reflects the inherent uncertainty in predicting cryptocurrency prices, considering the volatile nature of the market and the multitude of factors that can influence price movements.</p>

<title>Why Is Bitcoin Price Up Today? Key Reasons Explained</title>

<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/why-is-bitcoin-price-up-today-key-reasons-explained/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章指出，在过去24小时内，比特币价格出现了显著的反弹，涨幅达到了10%，从每日最低的$60,805上涨到$68,250。这一价格波动的重要因素包括昨天的美联储公开市场委员会（FOMC）会议、Coinbase Premium的显著变化以及比特币从下降通道中突破的技术走势。FOMC会议上鲍威尔的鸽派言论激发了乐观情绪，Coinbase Premium从负数转为正数表明现货比特币ETF需求增加，比特币价格突破下降通道也引起交易者和分析师的关注。当前比特币价格为$67,397。 <div>
<p>Within the last 24 hours, the market witnessed a significant rally in the Bitcoin price, which soared by 10% from a daily low of $60,805 to a peak of $68,250. This remarkable price movement can be attributed to several key factors, including yesterday’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, a notable change in the Coinbase Premium, and Bitcoin&#8217;s technical breakout from a downtrend channel.</p>
<h2>#1 FOMC Meeting: Dovish Remarks By Jerome Powell Fuel Optimism</h2>
<p>As <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/fomc-preview-bitcoin-crypto-fed-rate-move/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">reported yesterday</a>, the macro environment came back into focus for Bitcoin and crypto following the hotter than expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) inflation data in the US. Investors seemed to have de-risked their positions prior to the FOMC event. However, investors got a favorable outcome.</p>
<p>The pivot point for Bitcoin&#8217;s rally can be traced back to the Federal Reserve&#8217;s latest FOMC meeting, where Chairman Jerome Powell delivered a speech that the market interpreted as dovish. The Fed&#8217;s stance, especially in light of recent inflation data, has reassured investors.</p>

<p>Crypto analyst Furkan Yildirim <a href="https://twitter.com/FurkanCCTV/status/1770512293488451628" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">provided</a> a summary of the FOMC&#8217;s key points: &#8220;The ‘Dot Plot’ projections show that the median official expects three quarter-percent cuts in 2024 [&#8230;] The FOMC voted unanimously to leave the federal funds rate unchanged [&#8230;] The median forecast for PCE inflation remains unchanged at 2.4% for 2024 [&#8230;] Officials have also raised forecasts for where they see interest rates in the long term.&#8221;</p>
<p>The reaction to these announcements was immediately bullish in the traditional finance markets as well as Bitcoin and crypto. QCP Capital, a Singapore-based crypto asset trading firm, <a href="https://t.me/QCPbroadcast/1170" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">highlighted</a> the dovish nature of the FOMC&#8217;s stance: &#8220;1. In Powell&#8217;s press conference speech, he was not concerned about the high inflation numbers in Jan and Feb. 2. In the dot plot, more members shifted their projection to 3 cuts in 2024 (9 members vs 6 in Dec).&#8221;</p>
<p>Analyst Ted (@tedtalksmacro) further <a href="https://twitter.com/tedtalksmacro/status/1770525419802186083" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">emphasized</a> the positive implications: &#8220;FOMC summary: &#8211; 3x rate cuts happening this year despite inflation remaining above 2% (Fed expects core PCE at 2.6%). Growth outlook upgraded. Send it.&#8221;</p>
#2 Coinbase Premium Turns Green: A Sign Of Spot ETF Demand
<p>The Coinbase Premium&#8217;s shift to positive territory can be identified as another critical factor influencing Bitcoin&#8217;s price movement. While yesterday&#8217;s <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-etfs-see-record-1-billion-inflows/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">ETF flows</a> were negative again for the third day in a row, the Bitcoin <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-coinbase-premium-negative-price-recovery/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Coinbase Premium</a> was a glimmer of hope that spot Bitcoin ETFs will further fuel price.</p>
<p>CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn remarked: “Coinbase Premium is positive again. It&#8217;s around +$50. Beautiful.” The Coinbase Premium is crucial for BTC price in recent months as it reflects the demand from spot Bitcoin ETFs before the actual numbers are released one day later. Coinbase <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/coinbase/coinbase-custody-accounts-for-90-of-all-bitcoin-etfs-details/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">custodies eight of 11</a> spot Bitcoin ETFs or about 90% of the Bitcoin ETF assets as a result. Thus, Coinbase premium is crucial for a continued rally.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p></p>
<p>GBTC had $386.6 million worth of outflows yesterday. Notably, Blackrock only had $49.3 million of inflows, Fidelity had $12.9 million. This was one of the weakest inflow days for the leading Bitcoin ETFs so far &#8211; a huge disappointment.</p>

<p>But renowned crypto analyst WhalePanda remarked: “We pumped after the FOMC and overall it was better than what boomers expected. Price is now dumping on the news of negative flows but I think they&#8217;ll be in for a nice surprise tomorrow.&#8221;</p>

<p></p>
#3 BTC Price Breaks Out Of Downtrend Channel
<p>On the technical front, Bitcoin&#8217;s breakout from a parallel downtrend channel has caught the attention of traders and analysts alike. Daan Crypto Trades highlighted the importance of this movement on X (formerly Twitter): “Bitcoin tested its 4H 200MA/EMA and has been holding nicely there and broke out. Still watching this channel which will dictate BTC&#8217;s next move.”</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">#Bitcoin</a> Tested its 4H 200MA/EMA and has been holding nicely there and broke out.</p>
<p>Still watching this channel which will dictate <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">$BTC</a>'s next move.</p>
<p>Bulls would want to see this consolidate above and not fall back into the channel. <a href="https://t.co/94etUo6YAR" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/94etUo6YAR</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Daan Crypto Trades (@DaanCrypto) <a href="https://twitter.com/DaanCrypto/status/1770549220526768540?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">March 20, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>The chart shared by Daan shows that BTC price has been consolidating in a parallel downtrend channel for more than a week. Yesterday’s surge catapulted the price above the channel. Currently a retest is taking place. If this is successful, the BTC price could rally further north.</p>
<p>At press time, BTC traded at $67,397.</p>

<title>Leading The Pack: Solana Captures Nearly 50% Of Global Crypto Attention</title>

<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/leading-the-pack-solana-captures-nearly-50-of-global-crypto-attention/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br /> Solana生态系统成为今年最受欢迎的区块链生态系统之一，吸引了全球近一半的加密货币投资者。Solana的本土模因代币和重要的生态项目代币取得了出色表现，显示出对网络的信心。Solana的TVL在过去两年达到最高点，交易量和交易费用也大幅增长。与此同时，以太坊仍是今年第二大流行的区块链生态系统，吸引了约13%的投资者兴趣。 <div>
<p>The Solana ecosystem has achieved a significant milestone by becoming the most popular blockchain ecosystem of the year. This is due to its ability to capture nearly half of the world&#8217;s crypto investor interest in the chain-specific theater.</p>
<p>Together with the outstanding performance of native meme coins like dogwifhat and important ecosystem project tokens like Pyth, Solana&#8217;s comeback to 2021 peaks, indicating a revived faith in the network.</p>



<h2><strong>Solana&#8217;s Dominance: Coingecko Study Insights</strong></h2>
<p>According to a study by Coingecko, as a result of<a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Solana?volume=true&amp;tvl=false&amp;currency=USD" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> Solana&#8217;s nearly 50% share of global chain-specific interest,</a> and its affiliated projects&#8217; increasing popularity and performance, the ecosystem has a significant mindshare that reinforces its leadership in the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-598943" height="758" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_57662c.png?resize=671%2C758" width="671" /></p>
<p>Currently priced at $191, Solana (SOL) has increased by 13% in value over the past 24 hours. The fifth-ranked cryptocurrency has a market capitalization of nearly $85 billion, and its 24-hour trading volume amounted to $9 billion.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/vE3EI3kS/" width="1835" /></p>

<p>The popularity of Solana&#8217;s meme coins and ecosystem initiatives are successful in attracting attention to the network&#8217;s lively and dynamic ecosystem. As long as Solana is drawing attention and capital, its ecosystem will continue to dominate the cryptocurrency investor scene, paving the way for network expansion and innovation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Ethereum,</a> on the other hand, is the second most popular blockchain ecosystem this year, having garnered nearly 13% of investor interest. Ethereum is probably not a new, hot crypto narrative anymore as its ecosystem and investors are already familiar with it. The Ethereum ecosystem is also seeing its focus spread out among the layer 2 ecosystems that are developing on top of it.</p>

<h2><strong>Factors Driving Solana&#8217;s TVL Increase</strong></h2>
<p>Meanwhile, according to DefiLlama&#8217;s data, the Solana blockchain has demonstrated a remarkable performance, with its decentralized finance (DeFi)<a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Solana?volume=true&amp;tvl=false&amp;currency=USD" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> total value locked (TVL) rising by nearly 80%</a> in the previous month alone.</p>
<p>Related Reading: <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/defi-turmoil-over-5-million-wiped-out-in-liquidations-amid-ethereum-price-drop/"> DeFi Turmoil: Over $5 Million Wiped Out In Liquidations Amid Ethereum Price Drop</a></p>
<p>This incredible ascent represented a significant turning point for the network, with the Solana TVL reaching its highest point in the previous two years. According to the most recent report, Solana is among the top five with the fastest-rising TVL in DeFi, with nearly $4 billion.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-598946" height="304" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_bf6411.png?resize=1024%2C304" width="1024" /></p>

<p>Much of Solana&#8217;s TVL is based on the increase in trade volume, which is tracked by the Defi protocols and operates across its Layer 1 (L1) network.</p>
<p>Just this past month, there was a 125% increase in the daily trading volume of these protocols; the level of trading reached a peak of nearly $3.7 billion.</p>
<p>Additionally, the network achieved an all-time high of $1.6 million in total daily fees, with fee income of $3.61 million.</p>

<title>Dogecoin Price Holds Crucial Support But Can DOGE Clear This Hurdle?</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/doge/dogecoin-price-support-0-1220/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/doge/dogecoin-price-support-0-1220/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br /> Dogecoin兑美元的价格在$0.1220附近获得支撑后正在回升。价格目前低于$0.1650关键阻力和100小时简单移动平均线。然而，价格突破$0.1600和$0.1650阻力水平可能会推动价格向$0.200迈进。MACD和RSI指标显示了积极的趋势。支撑水平分别位于$0.1450、$0.130和$0.1150，而阻力水平分别位于$0.1580、$0.160和$0.1650。 <div>
<p><em>Dogecoin is recovering higher from $0.1220 against the US Dollar. DOGE must clear the $0.1650 resistance to start another increase toward $0.200.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>DOGE declined heavily and tested the $0.1220 support against the US dollar.</li>
<li>The price is trading below the $0.1650 level and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $0.1310 on the 4-hour chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken).</li>
<li>The price could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $0.1600 and $0.1650 resistance levels.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Dogecoin Price Recovers Over 15%</h2>
<p>After a strong decline, Dogecoin price found support near the $0.1220 zone. A low was formed at $0.1228 and DOGE recently started a decent recovery wave, like <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-jumps-68k/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin</a> and <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-rallies-3550/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ethereum</a>.</p>
<p>There was a steady increase above the $0.1320 and $0.1350 resistance levels. The price cleared the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.1927 swing high to the $0.1228 low.

<li>There was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance at $3,400 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD (data feed via Kraken).</li>
<li>The pair could continue to rise if it settles above the $3,550 resistance zone.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ethereum Price Starts Recovery</h2>
<p>Ethereum price extended its decline below the $3,350 and $3,200 levels, like <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-jumps-68k/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin</a>. ETH even declined below the $3,150 support level before the bulls appeared. It tested the $3,050 zone.</p>
<p>A low was formed at $3,059 and the price is moving higher. There was a strong recovery wave above the $3,350 resistance. The price cleared the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $3,675 swing high to the $3,059 low.</p>
<p>There was also a break above a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-bears-aim-3000/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">major bearish trend line</a> with resistance at $3,400 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.

<title>Cardano (ADA) Eyes Explosive 2000% Bull Run, Targeting $12 And Quadrupling ATH</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano/cardano-ada-eyes-explosive-2000-bull-run-targeting-12-and-quadrupling-ath/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano/cardano-ada-eyes-explosive-2000-bull-run-targeting-12-and-quadrupling-ath/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章指出，虽然Cardano (ADA)在最近的加密市场下行趋势中遇到了挑战，但有迹象表明潜在的上行动力正在建立。分析师指出，ADA的市场走势从熊市转为牛市，表明可能开始一次重要的牛市。如果ADA再次经历类似于2021年4月的牛市，可能会超过1美元，并潜在达到12.6美元的目标。此外，Cardano的关键指标显示出强劲的增长，包括市值、交易量和手续费。ADA目前的价格为0.603美元。 <div>
<p>Cardano (ADA), currently positioned as the 9th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has encountered a downward trend following the prevailing bearish sentiment in the crypto market. <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/breaking-news-ticker/breaking-bitcoin-hits-new-all-time-high-surging-past-70000-for-the-first-time-in-history/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin </a>(BTC), the market leader, has led the way in price corrections for top cryptocurrencies. </p>
<p>Despite ADA&#8217;s recent retracement of nearly 20% in the past week after reaching a 22-month high of $0.810 on March 14, there are indications that a potential <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/ada/ada-price-prediction-0-75/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">trend reversal</a> is on the horizon. This shift in momentum could potentially drive ADA towards reclaiming the $1 mark, which it hasn&#8217;t reached since April 2022.</p>
<h2>Bullish Momentum Building For ADA</h2>
<p>Crypto analyst &#8220;Trend Rider,&#8221; who shares his insights on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), has highlighted ADA&#8217;s market shift from bearish to bullish trends. Looking at the two-week chart, key moving averages are realigning, signaling a transition to a bullish framework as indicators move from red to green. </p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/TrendRidersTR/status/1770441959020093907?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">According </a>to the analyst, this pattern is similar to a previous occurrence observed just before ADA embarked on a significant bull run. </p>

<img alt="Cardano " class="size-large wp-image-598926" height="484" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GJHex2WWMAAtvtp.jpeg?w=860&#038;resize=860%2C484" width="860" />
<p>If history repeats itself and mirrors the April 2021 bull run, where ADA rose from $0.133 to its current all-time high (ATH) of $3.168 in less than a year, posting gains of over 2000%, a similar uptrend could easily take ADA past the $1 mark. </p>
<p>If another 2000% price surge materializes, it could push Cardano&#8217;s native token to reach the $12.6 level, marking a significant quadrupling of its <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano/cardano-breakout-network/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">all-time high </a>milestone.</p>
<p>While the market correction continues, Trend Rider has <a href="https://x.com/TrendRidersTR/status/1770102612567691274?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">identified </a>crucial support lines that must be held back to maintain the bullish structure. According to the analyst, the trend support for ADA is anticipated to range between $0.45 and $0.52. </p>
<h2>Key Cardano Metrics Soar</h2>
<p>Cardano has shown significant progress in key metrics, as indicated by data from Token Terminal. The figures reflect a significant increase in market capitalization, trading volume, and fees, highlighting the adoption of the Cardano blockchain ecosystem. </p>
<p>According to Token Terminal <a href="https://tokenterminal.com/terminal/projects/cardano" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">data</a>, Cardano&#8217;s fully diluted market capitalization is approximately $29.80 billion, representing strong growth over the past 30 days. This figure indicates the total value of all ADA tokens, including those not yet in circulation. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the circulating market capitalization, which factors in only the tokens currently available for trading, has also experienced a notable increase, reaching around $23.35 billion. </p>
<img alt="Cardano " class="size-large wp-image-598927" height="451" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot_83.jpg?w=674&#038;resize=674%2C451" width="674" />
<p>Moreover, Cardano has witnessed a significant surge in trading volume over the past 30 days. The<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano/cardano-ada-price-rally-is-far-from-over/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> trading volume</a> has soared to approximately $27.96 billion, reflecting an increase of 117.5%. This surge indicates heightened market activity and a growing demand for ADA tokens.</p>

<p>Another noteworthy aspect revealed by Token Terminal data is the substantial growth in fees generated within the Cardano network. Over the past 30 days, fees have amounted to approximately $506.07k, demonstrating a significant increase of 36.5%. </p>
<p>When annualized, the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano-ada-price-alert-analyst-predicts-60-rally-in-next-7-days/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">fees generated</a> by the Cardano blockchain reach an estimated $6.16 million, reflecting a notable growth rate of 5.2%. This signifies the expanding usage of the Cardano network for various transactions and applications.</p>
<img alt="Cardano " class="size-large" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/MdNVogYV/" width="1815" />
<p>ADA is trading at $0.603, down 2.6% in the last 24 hours. </p>

<title>Solana Whale Makes Massive 1,000,000 SOL Deposit To Binance, Bearish Sign?</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-whale-1000000-sol-binance-bearish/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-whale-1000000-sol-binance-bearish/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。Solana的一个大户将大量SOL转移到币安交易所，可能对资产价格产生不利影响。文章介绍了六笔大额SOL交易，其中一笔价值1亿美元的交易涉及到了币安交易所。这些交易表明有可能大户开始在交易所抛售SOL，这可能会影响市场价格。当前Solana的价格已经下滑至174美元水平。 <div>
<p>On-chain data shows a Solana whale has just moved a massive SOL stack to Binance, which could prove to be bearish for the asset&#8217;s price.</p>
<h2>Solana Whale Has Deposited 1 Million SOL To Binance Today</h2>
<p>According to data from the cryptocurrency transaction tracker service <a href="https://twitter.com/whale_alert" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Whale Alert</a>, several large SOL transactions have occurred on the blockchain during the past day.</p>
<p>More specifically, six massive transfers have been spotted on the network. Out of these, two transactions were gigantic, with tokens worth $362 million and $498 million involved.</p>

<p>These extraordinary transfers, though, were both between unknown wallets. Addresses like these are those unattached to any known centralized exchange, so they are usually the users&#8217; personal, self-custodial wallets.</p>
<p>Due to this, transfers between unknown wallets are generally hard to say anything about. Often, they can be as simple as the investor moving to a fresh wallet, which is naturally of no particular consequence for the wider market.</p>
<p>The other four whale transactions from the past day, however, did involve central entities on one end, so speculation around them can have a bit more ground to stand on.</p>
<p>Out of these four, one transaction in particular stands out. In this move, a whale shifted 1 million SOL on the network, worth more than $166 million at the transfer time. Below are some additional details regarding this transfer.</p>
<p><img alt="Solana Whale Inflow" class="alignnone wp-image-598903 size-large aligncenter" height="483" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/details.png?w=860&#038;resize=860%2C483" width="860" /></p>

<p>As is visible, the receiver in the case of this transaction was a wallet affiliated with the cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/94-million-xrp-exits-binance/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Binance</a>, implying that the whale transferred coins from their address to the platform.</p>
<p>Such transactions are known as <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-whales-exchange-inflow-bad-sign-price/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">exchange inflows</a>. Users make these transfers when they want to use one of the exchange services, which can include selling.</p>
<p>As such, exchange inflows may sometimes be bearish for the cryptocurrency. In particular, massive inflows made by the whales can exert some visible fluctuations on the market.</p>
<p>Just like this huge SOL transfer, the other three transactions mentioned before were also exchange inflows. They were significantly smaller in scale, though, with their average value being $33.2 million.</p>
<p>Two of these transactions also went to Binance, while the third (and the latest) headed to <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-ascent-to-64000-causes-coinbase-to-crash-heres-what-happened/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Coinbase</a>. Interestingly, the address pairs in these two Binance transfers were the same, hinting that the same whale may have been responsible for them.</p>
<p>With the four exchange inflows, Solana, worth $265.6 million, has now found its way to exchanges. This is clearly a notable amount, so it may impact the asset&#8217;s price.</p>

<p>There is no guarantee, however, that any of the whales involved made these transactions for selling; it&#8217;s possible that they made the moves for some other purpose that&#8217;s not directly relevant to the market.</p>
<p>Although Solana has been sliding off over the past few days, the possibility of these whales deciding to exit certainly exists.</p>
<h2>SOL Price</h2>
<p>Following the recent drawdown Solana has seen, the asset&#8217;s price has come down to the $174 level.</p>

<title>Celsius Fights To Reclaim $2 Billion Withdrawn Prior To Bankruptcy Declaration</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/celsius/celsius-fights-to-reclaim-2-billion-withdrawn-prior-to-bankruptcy-declaration/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/celsius/celsius-fights-to-reclaim-2-billion-withdrawn-prior-to-bankruptcy-declaration/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的<br />根据彭博的报告，Celsius Network要求在2022年7月破产申请之前集体提取了超过20亿美元的主要客户将这些资金返还，以免潜在诉讼。破产委员会已开始联系在公司破产申请前90天内提取100,000美元以上的客户。委员会提供了和解选项，根据客户在2022年提取时的资产价值来确定可能的金额。客户可以选择和解以免遭受潜在诉讼的法律后果。目前，Celsius Network的主网币CEL正在交易中表现不佳。 <div>
<p>According to a Bloomberg report, Celsius Network, the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-bloodbath-celsius-eth/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">crypto platform</a> that filed for bankruptcy in July 2022, demands that major customers who collectively withdrew over $2 billion before the bankruptcy return those funds to avoid potential litigation. </p>
<p>An oversight committee formed during Celsius&#8217;s Chapter 11 case has begun contacting customers who withdrew more than $100,000 during the period leading up to the company&#8217;s bankruptcy filing. This recovery effort aims to repay creditors <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/celsius-seeks-repayment-creditors-urged-to-return-27-5-of-funds/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">who did not withdraw</a> funds from Celsius. </p>
<h2>Settlement Offered To Celsius Users </h2>
<p>Per the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-20/celsius-seeks-return-of-2-billion-withdrawn-before-bankruptcy" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, the oversight committee&#8217;s recovery process will impact around 2% of Celsius users who, in total, withdrew approximately 40% of the platform&#8217;s assets within the 90 days preceding the Chapter 11 filing. </p>
<p>Celsius reported $6 billion in assets, 1.7 million registered users, and 300,000 active users with account balances exceeding $100 at the time of bankruptcy. </p>

<p>Notably, the oversight committee has offered customers who may face clawback suits a settlement option, providing them with a “favorable rate” if they choose to settle. </p>
<p>Customers who opt for settlement would have their potential <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/celsius-dump-triggers-ethereum-dive-35-million-sell-off-sends-eth-price-crashing/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">liabilities </a>determined based on the value of their assets at the time of their 2022 withdrawals. This means that settling customers would retain any appreciation in the value of their digital assets resulting from the surge in crypto prices over the past year.</p>
<h2>Legal Consequences If Settlement Offer Is Declined</h2>
<p>According to Bloomberg, customers who decline to settle may be subject to significantly more liability through potential litigation. The committee&#8217;s letter warns customers about the potential consequences of not accepting the settlement offer.</p>
<p>In November, a bankruptcy judge approved Celsius&#8217; plan to distribute billions of dollars in assets and transform into a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/celsius-bitcoin-mining-plan-on-creditor-vote/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">creditor-owned Bitcoin mining firm</a>. According to a court filing by the company&#8217;s lawyers, Celsius has already distributed around $2 billion in assets.</p>

<p>Overall, Celsius Network&#8217;s oversight committee is pursuing the recovery of over $2 billion in withdrawals made by major customers shortly before the company filed for <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-faces-market-tremors-as-celsius-offloads-1-billion-in-eth/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">bankruptcy</a>. By offering settlement options based on the value of assets at the time of withdrawal, Celsius aims to alleviate potential litigation and expedite the repayment of creditors. </p>
<p>As the process unfolds, impacted customers decide to settle potential liabilities or face potential litigation with potentially higher consequences.</p>
<img alt="Celsius" class="size-large" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/eDbS48ev/" width="1815" />
<p>Currently, the network&#8217;s native token, CEL, is trading at $0.1862, reflecting a significant year-to-date decline of over 49%.</p>
<p>In shorter time frames, the token has experienced a 12% decline in the last 24 hours, a 32% decline in the last week, and a 27% decline in the last fourteen days, highlighting the limited interest and lack of confidence among investors in the CEL token.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。文章指出了10x Research首席分析师Markus Thielen对比特币和以太坊的悲观展望。Thielen认为市场尚未触底，建议不要过早购买。他警告称，比特币的关键支撑水平为63,000美元和60,000美元，破位60,000美元可能会导致跌至52,000美元到54,000美元的区间。尽管短期看涨信号不明显，Thielen对比特币未来可能的变化持乐观态度，预计一年内可能会攀升至超过100,000美元。同时，市场涨跌受美联储即将公布的决定影响，加剧了加密市场的不确定性和波动性。 <div>
<p>Amid a recent downturn in the broader crypto market, the concept of &#8220;buying the dip&#8221; has once again surfaced, tempting traders and investors with the prospect of snagging assets at lower prices. However, <a href="https://mail.10xresearch.co/p/bitcoin-turned-bearish-10-days-ago" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">caution</a> is the watchword from Markus Thielen, CEO of 10x Research, a top analyst in the crypto space.</p>
<p>Thielen&#8217;s latest advisories suggest that the current market conditions may not yet be ripe for the optimistic strategy of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/profit-taking-panic-short-term-bitcoin-holders/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">dip purchasing</a>.</p>

<h2>The Basis Of Bearish Sentiment</h2>
<p>Thielen&#8217;s recent analysis, released earlier today, underscores a bearish outlook on <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/high-stakes-week-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum-as-central-bank-decisions-approach-key-predictions/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">flagship cryptocurrencies</a> Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), advising that it may be premature to buy the dip.</p>
<p>This guidance is rooted in a comprehensive approach to <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/planbs-bitcoin-forecast-a-journey-to-5-million/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">market analysis</a>, combining analog models, data-driven predictive models, and objective analysis.</p>
<img alt="Bitcoin Analog Model. " height="358" src="https://i0.wp.com/media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/10248879-4abc-4bd1-930a-56628283e2dc/image.png?resize=642%2C358&#038;ssl=1" width="642" />
<p>At the heart of Thielen&#8217;s cautionary stance is a detailed report outlining the factors contributing to the firm, 10x Research&#8217; bearish outlook on Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>
<p>Despite a seemingly attractive price point for these cryptocurrencies, Thielen believes the market has not yet bottomed out, suggesting further declines before any significant rally.</p>
<p>The report pinpoints $63,000 and $60,000 as critical support levels for Bitcoin. A breach below $60,000, Thielen warns, could precipitate a fall into the $52,000-$54,000 range.</p>
<p>Yet, despite these short-term bearish indicators, Thielen <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-might-be-poised-for-a-double-pump/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">remains optimistic</a> about Bitcoin&#8217;s potential, envisioning a climb to heights of over $100,000 within the year. Thielen noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>Buying this dip is still too early. Technically, we still expect Bitcoin to trade below 60,000 before a more meaningful rally attempt is started. Based on the previous new high signals, we could paint a rosy picture of 83,000 and 102,000 upside targets, but for the time being, we are more focused on managing the downside.</p></blockquote>
<h2>The Crypto Market&#8217;s Critical Juncture</h2>
<p>The current state of the crypto market reflects a tense anticipation of the upcoming central bank announcements from the US Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>This decision is expected to significantly influence monetary policy and, by extension, the cryptocurrency market. Particularly, <a href="https://medium.com/@BloFin_Official/blofin-whales-view-week-11-2024-2f4ecc640093" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">insights</a> from crypto futures exchange Blofin suggest that the outcome of this announcement could sway market sentiment substantially.</p>
<img alt="Bitcoin (BTC) price chart on TradingView amid crypto news" height="1496" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/xASyEjNI/" width="2770" />
<p>Meanwhile, the market reacts in real-time, with Bitcoin slightly increasing 2.4% in the past 24 hours but still showing a notable decline over the past week. Adding to the complexity of the market dynamics are observations from Alex Krüger, a respected figure in macroeconomics and cryptoanalysis.</p>

<p>Krüger attributes the recent <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crash-60800-worst-over-experts/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">price collapse to several factors</a>, including market over-leverage, the negative sentiment ripple from Ethereum, and speculative fervor around certain altcoins. These elements combine to paint a picture of a market at a crossroads, with significant volatility and uncertainty ahead.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Reasons for the crash, in order of importance</p>
<p>(for those who need them)</p>
<p>#1 Too much leverage (funding matters)
#2 ETH driving market south (market decided ETF not passing)
#3 Negative BTC ETF inflows (careful, data is T+1)
#4 Solana shitcoin mania (it went too far)</p>
<p>— Alex Krüger (@krugermacro) <a href="https://twitter.com/krugermacro/status/1770240971223007251?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">March 20, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<title>Trezor X Account Hacked: How Much Was Taken In The Fake Crypto Presale?</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/trezor-x-account-hacked-how-much-was-taken-in-the-fake-crypto-presale/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/trezor-x-account-hacked-how-much-was-taken-in-the-fake-crypto-presale/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。Trezor的X账户被黑客攻击，用于推广虚假加密货币代币销售。社区成员快速发现可疑活动，并警告其他用户。黑客窃取了8100美元，但社区的快速反应避免了更大的损失。Trezer表示继续调查此事件，并呼吁用户保持警惕。 <div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In the late hours of Tuesday, Trezor’s X account was compromised. The hacker used the hardware wallet company account to promote a fake crypto presale with a malicious link attached.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Members of the crypto community quickly realized the suspicious activity from the company and alerted other X users about the scam. Since then, Trezor’s team has regained control of the account.</p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto Community’s Solidarity, Hackers’ New Prey</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In the now-deleted tweets, the hacker announced that Trezor was “willing to support the $SLERF Community.” Taking advantage of the ongoing efforts from crypto projects and exchanges to raise funds for the affected participants of the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana-memecoin-presale-gone-wrong-creator-accidentally-burns-10m-whale-makes-huge-profit/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Slerf presale debacle</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Community alert: Trezor X/Twitter account is currently compromised <a href="https://t.co/hNm2OUjEgE" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/hNm2OUjEgE</a></p>
<p>&mdash; ZachXBT (@zachxbt) <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1770225097552363795?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">March 19, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The unauthorized post offered the presale of a fake $TRZR token, which required interested users to send SOL to the hacker’s address. Additionally, Trezor supporters would receive a “separate bonus airdrop” if they went to a website linked in the post.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As it’s customary for phishing scams, the link would redirect to a wallet drainer that takes control of the person’s wallet after they try to “claim the airdrop tokens.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The crypto community shared their thoughts on the hack. A user <a href="https://x.com/i_am_wilf/status/1770411148271128913?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">pointed out</a> that the security breach was a &#8220;bad look&#8221; for the company as it focuses on crypto security. Others thanked the users who warned about the hack since it potentially saved them and others from falling for it.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It’s worth noting that many users have raised their concerns about the community’s reaction to the Slerf presale drama. They <a href="https://x.com/DeNomics_/status/1770061164829122893?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">consider</a> that raising funds for the participants affected sets a precedent of “bailing out” bad actors and will only “enable” similar behavior.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, scammers have been trying to prey on the community’s good faith to help potential victims and newcomers. As seen with the Trezor hack, the scammer seemingly tried to maximize its gains by utilizing the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/crypto-presale-frenzy-raises-over-122m-worth-of-sol-in-a-week/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">presale meta trend</a> and the Slerf drama.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">“Dumb” Hacker Or Smarter Community?</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Usually, the recounting of crypto hacks ends with staggering figures being stolen, but for once, the tale is different. As <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1770237007366639681" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reported</a> by ZachXBT, the hacker managed to steal $8,100 from the unauthorized post, which includes the 25% drainer fee. As part of the loot, the hacker also received a &#8220;whooping 0.96 Solana,&#8221; as another user <a href="https://twitter.com/Theft/status/1770237549547802922" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">pointed</a> out.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Many wondered if the small amount stolen was due to the community intelligently recognizing the scam or the hacker’s inability to perform a big heist. Whatever the case, this is a remarkable feat as the cold wallet company amasses over 200,000 followers that momentarily became potential victims.</p>

<p></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Despite this small victory for the community, “It’s $8.1K more than 0,” as one user said. This raises the question of whether the hack was possible due to a lack of proper security measures or an inside job taking place.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">No official explanation has been given yet. Nonetheless, Trezor acknowledged the hack in an X post earlier today.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>We experienced a security incident on our X/Twitter account overnight, despite robust protections including a strong password and 2FA. We continue to investigate.</p>
<p>Please remain vigilant and remember, Trezor will NEVER request funds or assets be sent to any address.…</p>

<p></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The company affirmed that the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/algorand/algorand-ceos-x-account-hacked-is-justin-sun-involved/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">hack happened</a> despite its “robust protections,” including two-factor authentication (2FA). At the time of writing, Trezor is continuing its investigation. The statement closed with a message for all users to “remain vigilant.”</p>

<title>Bitcoin Pre-Halving Dip Expected: Will BTC Rally Before US Fed Decision?</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-pre-halving-btc-rally-us-fed-decision/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-pre-halving-btc-rally-us-fed-decision/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章指出比特币目前处于熊市形态，与2020年减半前的走势相似。在2024年4月的减半事件前，网络准备削减矿工奖励。比特币价格历来在减半前刷新高点后下跌，之后再次攀升至新高。技术指标显示，当前价格向下的趋势较为明显。联邦储备系统将于3月20日公布利率决定，此举可能影响比特币需求及价格变动。 <div>
<p>Bitcoin remains under pressure when writing and is within a bearish formation following sharp losses on March 19. While prices tank, one analyst on X <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/rektcapital/status/1770414124087869842" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">thinks</a> this retracement aligns with historical performance, especially as the network prepares to slash miner rewards in April 2024. </p>
<h2>Bitcoin Retracement Similar To Pre-Halving Cool-Off Of 2020</h2>
<p>Based on the analyst&#8217;s assessment, BTC is currently down roughly 18% from its recent swing high. This retracement is at the same level as the ballpark 19% decline observed before the previous halving event in 2020. </p>
<img alt="Bitcoin pre-halving rally | Source: analyst on X" class="size-full wp-image-598896" height="686" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GJHFw8dWIAAGmR1.jpg?resize=1024%2C686" width="1024" />
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Bitcoin has historically corrected lower after posting fresh highs before halving. Afterward, the coin rallies to fresh all-time highs following halving, driven by a decrease in supply. In this cycle, BTC soared to a new all-time high of $73,800 in the first two weeks of March before cooling off to spot rate, a deviation from the usual trend.</p>

<p>As the Bitcoin network gears up for the halving event in mid-April 2024, it&#8217;s crucial to note the potential market implications. Some market observers speculate that the current drop could offer entries for investors looking to accumulate at a lower price in anticipation of future price gains. </p>
<p>From the Bitcoin candlestick arrangement in the daily chart, the least resistance path appears southwards. Specifically, following the dip on March 19, the coin remains in a bearish breakout pattern, finding strong rejections from the middle Bollinger Band (BB) or the 20-day moving average. The BB is a technical indicator for gauging volatility.</p>
<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/x/xxEEb9Fc/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="Bitcoin price trending downward on the daily chart | Source: BTCUSDT on Binance, TradingView" class="size-full" height="904" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/xxEEb9Fc/" width="1787" /></a>
<h2>Will The Federal Reserve Revive BTC Demand?</h2>
<p>Currently, Bitcoin is steady. Even so, only time will tell whether prices will recover, breaking above the $70,000 level in the days leading up to the halving event in less than a month. Further losses from spot rates mean the dip before halving and after the pre-halving rally was much sharper than in 2020.</p>
<p>As history clearly shows, halving is an important event in Bitcoin. It has repeatedly proven to be a major price catalyst for Bitcoin, as seen in the last bull cycle when prices rose to roughly $70,000. </p>

<p>Accordingly, the coming days will shape how Bitcoin prices evolve in the medium to long term. One key driver of crypto and BTC valuation will be fundamental events, especially pronouncements from the United States Federal Reserve (<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/fomc-preview-bitcoin-crypto-fed-rate-move/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Fed</a>). The central bank will relay its decision on interest rates on March 20. Earlier in 2022, when interest rates were hiked, prices tanked.</p>

<title>Top 3 Solana Meme Coins To Buy Amid The Bitcoin Crash That Could 10x</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/meme-coins/top-3-solana-meme-coins/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/meme-coins/top-3-solana-meme-coins/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />比特币价格暴跌使加密市场陷入困境，但也为某些潜在投资机会提供了可能。本文列出了三种可能将投资组合增长10倍的明智选择的玩梗币。首先是基于Solana的Myro，最近在交易所上市，有望超过10倍增长。其次是Popcat，近期表现不俗，市值为1.67亿美元，有潜力超过1亿美元。最后是Wen（WEN）玩梗币，市值不到2亿美元，预计有可能增长10倍。这些Solana玩梗币在加密市场中展现出巨大潜力。 <div>
<p class="p2">As the Bitcoin price crash has ravaged the crypto market and left altcoins suffering, it has presented a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/meme-coins-market-cap-soar-to-over-54-billion/">unique buying opportunity for meme coins</a> that may never come after this time. So here are the top 3 meme coins that could 10x your portfolio from here.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Solana-Based Myro Leads Meme Coins With Potential</h2>
<p class="p2">Solana-based meme coins have been all the rave over the past year and with good reason as well. These meme coins have done so well in such a short time, coming up to compete with established Ethereum-based meme coins which have been around for years.</p>

<p class="p2">With the likes of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-tokens-among-top-gainers-jup-and-wen-soar-over-12-wif-hits-new-ath/">WIF</a> and <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-avalanche-bonk-pepe/">BONK</a> already crossing the $1 billion market cap market, the hunt is on for other Solana-based meme coins that could achieve this same feat, and that is where the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/god-candle-solana-meme-coin/">Myro token</a> comes in. <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/god-candle-solana-meme-coin/">Myro</a> currently has a $200 million market cap, which makes it a prime candidate for crossing $1 billion. However, its most bullish developments have been its exchange listings.</p>
<p class="p2">Myro scored a Binance perpetual listing last month, which pushed its market cap above $400 million for the first time. It has since retraced, but this retracement is similar to what was seen with WIF, which fell back down to $180 million at a point. If <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/god-candle-solana-meme-coin/">Myro</a> follows the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-tokens-among-top-gainers-jup-and-wen-soar-over-12-wif-hits-new-ath/">WIF</a> playbook, then its next leg up could see it rise more than 5x above the $1 billion mark.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Popcat: Another Solana Meme Coin On The Rise</h2>
<p class="p2">Popcat is another <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana-meme-coin-dogwifhat-wif-hits-new-ath-market-cap-breaks-1-6-billion/">Solana meme coin</a> that has made waves in the space over the past few months. After a long stretch of consolidation, the price had eventually broken out in February to reach a new all-time high price of $0.37 in mid-March.</p>
<p class="p2">The price has since retraced a little over 50% since then and is now back to $0.17 with a market cap of $167 million. As with the majority of other meme coins, the total supply of the token is in circulation, which means there are no more unlocks coming up.</p>
<p class="p2">At the current market cap, reaching the $1 billion mark would be an over 500% increase for the meme coin. And with the bull market coming up, the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-tokens-among-top-gainers-jup-and-wen-soar-over-12-wif-hits-new-ath/">price of Popcat</a> could rally higher, bringing a more than 10x return for investors.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Wen (WEN) Meme Coin</h2>
<p class="p2"><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-tokens-among-top-gainers-jup-and-wen-soar-over-12-wif-hits-new-ath/">Wen (WEN)</a> is another Solana-based meme coin that has hit the crypto space in the last few months. Starting out as an airdrop for users of the Solana-based Jupiter decentralized exchange, it has quickly grown among meme coin investors as one of the more stable investments.</p>

<p class="p2">Just like the other meme coins on this list, the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-tokens-among-top-gainers-jup-and-wen-soar-over-12-wif-hits-new-ath/">WEN token</a> shows a lot of promise because it is still under a $200 million market cap. This puts it at an at least 5x move to $1 billion, with a possible 10x when it reaches the $2 billion market cap mark.</p>

<title>Shiba Inu Sees A Shift: Short Term Holders Take Possession Of 23 Trillion SHIB</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-short-term-holders/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-short-term-holders/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。<br />市场动态导致Shiba Inu (SHIB)在本月初出现价格飙升，但投资者现在似乎正在撤离这种模因加密货币。On-chain数据表明，过去四天里，有超过23万亿SHIB从长期持有者手中流入短期持有者的钱包，这标志着价格可能会进一步下跌至$0.000023水平。技术分析显示SHIB的整体技术指标指向价格下跌，但仍有望在短期内恢复。 <div>
<p>Current market dynamics have seen Shiba Inu (SHIB) <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/behind-the-scenes-of-shiba-inu-12-plunge-what-on-chain-analysis-tells-us/">shedding off a lot of its gains</a> earlier in the month. SHIB kickstarted a price surge on February 29th at $0.00001178 to reach $0.00004456 for the first time since December 2021, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-price-skyrockets-heres-why/">representing a surge</a> of over 278% in the space of three days. </p>
<p>However, it seems investors are now pulling away from the meme cryptocurrency, and the bull frantic earlier in the month seems to be disappearing. Interestingly, on-chain data indicates that a chunk of over 23 trillion SHIB has moved from the hands of long-term holders into the wallets of short-term holders in the past four days. This cohort of addresses is known to hold their SHIB tokens for quick returns instead of holding them long-term.</p>
<h2>Shiba Inu Price Downtrend Expected to Extend Beyond 45%</h2>
<p>SHIB has been on a general downtrend since March 5 with the formation of lower highs in <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-price-soars-10-in-reaction-to-explosive-2367-shib-burn-surge/">cases of brief uptrends</a>. Notably, the crypto has dropped by 46% since attaining this two-year high. At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.000024, down by 4.79% and 27% in the past 24 hours and seven days, respectively.</p>

<p>According to data from IntoTheBlock, Short-term Shiba Inu owners have now increased their possession by 23 trillion SHIB in the past four days, signaling lower prices ahead. According to ITB&#8217;s &#8220;Balance by Time Held&#8221; metric, the balance held by traders holding for less than a month has increased by 385% in the last 30 days. At the same time, long-term holders (more than a year) and cruisers (holding for one to 12 months) have reduced their balance by 9.27% and 11.30%, respectively. </p>
<p><img alt="Shiba Inu" class="wp-image-598842 aligncenter" height="276" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Shiba-Inu.png?w=460&#038;resize=701%2C276" width="701" />This interesting movement demonstrates the current dynamic among the various cohorts of SHIB traders. The decrease in long-term holder balance indicates they might be taking profit after holding for so long. At the same time, so much of the supply is moving into the hands of short-term traders seeking quick profits, making SHIB vulnerable to continued selloffs.</p>
<h2>Technical Analysis: What&#8217;s Next For SHIB’s Price?</h2>
<p>The overall technical indicators for SHIB point to <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-open-interest-40-crash/">short-term correction</a> unless there is a change in <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-whales-shib/">bullish sentiment</a>. The meme token has now broken below support at the $0.000026 price level and is now moving towards $0.000023, a level that has acted as a major resistance earlier in the month.</p>

<p>On the other hand, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-surge-in-interest/" rel="nofollow">several fundamental factors</a> point to a potential price recovery and <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/crypto-analyst-shiba-inu-target/">continued growth</a> for the meme coin. Despite its recent correction, the price of SHIB is still up by 144% in the past 30 days, which shows the uptrend can resume anytime soon. </p>

<title>Santiment Reveals Best Altcoins Currently In “Opportunity Zone”</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/santiment-best-altcoins-opportunity-zone/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/santiment-best-altcoins-opportunity-zone/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> 摘要：<br /><br />这些信息是积极的。Santiment的链上分析显示了一些加密货币进入了中期“机会区”。MVRV指标显示了比特币市值与实现市值之间的比率，为投资者提供了有关投资价值的信息。通过分析MVRV的偏离情况，Santiment提出了“机会与危险区模型”，以确定哪些资产目前提供了卖出或买入的潜在窗口。一些进入中期机会区的潜在优质备选货币包括Lido DAO（LDO），Synthetix（SNX），Storj（STORJ）和OMG Network（OMG）。 <br /><br /> <div>
<p>The on-chain analytics firm Santiment has revealed the altcoins that have recently surged into the mid-term &#8220;opportunity zone.&#8221;</p>
<h2>These Altcoins May Be More Likely To See Rebounds</h2>
<p>In a new <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1770249809280237856" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Santiment has discussed what the various altcoins in the market are looking like from the perspective of the MVRV. The &#8220;<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-mvrv-levels-parabolic-bull-run-2020/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Market Value To Realized Value</a>&#8221; (MVRV) refers to an indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the Bitcoin market cap and the realized cap.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-long-term-holders-own-80-realized-cap/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">realized cap</a> here is a capitalization model for BTC that measures the total sum of capital that the investors have used to purchase their coins. As such, the MVRV tells us about how the value that the investors are holding right now (the market cap) compares against this initial investment.</p>

<p>Historically, the more profits the investors have held (that is, the higher the market cap has been compared to the realized cap), the more likely tops have been to occur. This is naturally because investors become more likely to give in to the allure of profit-taking the higher their gains get.</p>
<p>On the other hand, cryptocurrencies have been probable to see rebounds when holders&#8217; returns have dropped into the negative territory. In these conditions, there aren&#8217;t many profit-takers left, so selling pressure begins to run out.</p>
<p>Based on these facts, Santiment has come up with an &#8220;Opportunity &amp; Danger Zone Model&#8221; that uses the MVRV&#8217;s divergence from the norm on various timeframes to determine if an asset is providing a potential window for selling or buying right now.</p>
<p>Below is the chart shared by the on-chain analytics firm that reveals what this model is saying for altcoins around the sector:</p>
<p><img alt="Altcoins MVRV Ratio" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="1759" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GJEt5K7awAAN654?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096" width="2962" /></p>

<p>From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that a lot of coins are still inside the overbought territory, but several altcoins have managed to sneak into the mid-term opportunity zone following the recent market downturn led by <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crash-60800-worst-over-experts/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin&#8217;s plunge</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;This zone gets breached when an asset&#8217;s 30-day, 90-day, and 365-day average wallet returns are combining to be in negative territory,&#8221; explains Santiment. It should be noted, though, that while mid-term returns are red for these coins, they are still not yet inside the buy zone proper.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a zero sum game like crypto, projects with minimal returns compared to the rest of the sector have a higher probability of a more efficient rebound for those who are willing to #buythedip on projects traders are in the most pain on,&#8221; notes the analytics firm.</p>

<p>According to Santiment, some of the best altcoin candidates who are inside the mid-term opportunity zone include Lido DAO (LDO), Synthetix (SNX), Storj (STORJ), and OMG Network (OMG).</p>
<h2>LDO Price</h2>
<p>Lido DAO has had a bad time recently as its price has gone down more than 31% over the past week. With these red returns, it&#8217;s no wonder that the coin is becoming underbought on the MVRV.</p>

<title>Shiba Inu May Rise 250% Pre-Bitcoin Halving, Predicts SHIB Team</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-rise-250-pre-bitcoin-halving/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-rise-250-pre-bitcoin-halving/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。<br />Shiba Inu生态系统的主要官员预测SHIB代币价值将在接近比特币减半前暴涨250%。尽管SHIB最近下跌了43%，但Shiba Inu团队对代币前景持乐观态度，预测SHIB有望超过其2021年最高点。此外，团队还暗示SHIB有可能在市值上超越Dogecoin，通过计划中的“Secret Wags”策略。团队表示，他们有“#ShibaArmy”、”#Shibarium”和不能透露的战略，认为SHIB有望成为新的热门加密狗。 <div>
<p>In a bold forecast that is stirring considerable attention within the SHIB community, a prominent official from the Shiba Inu ecosystem has projected a staggering 250% surge in the token&#8217;s value leading up to the upcoming Bitcoin halving. Lucie, the marketing lead for Shiba Inu, expressed her confidence in a significant rebound for SHIB, predicting that the meme coin could surpass its 2021 all-time high (ATH) in the weeks ahead.</p>
<p>This optimistic outlook comes despite the token&#8217;s recent 43% decline to $0.000026 from its recent yearly high at $0.000045. Lucie shared her personal investment move on X, revealing her purchase of SHIB during the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-open-interest-40-crash/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">recent dip</a> at around $0.000024, amounting to $989.08.</p>
<p>She dubbed this strategy &#8220;Bought the DIP, my lovely SHIB,&#8221; showcasing her belief in a strong move for the meme coin. With SHIB currently trading at $0.000026, a 70% decrease from its ATH of $0.00008845, the crypto must experience a swift and significant rally of 250% to achieve its previous peak.</p>

<p>This ambitious target is set against the backdrop of the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/when-is-the-next-btc-halving-date-bitcoin-halving-guide/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">upcoming Bitcoin halving</a>, expected to occur in 22 to 31 days based on various estimates. “Bought the DIP. My lovely $SHIB. If someone can pull [a] miracle recovery, it’s SHIB. I’m expecting ATH soon before or shortly after BTC halving. Nfa,” Lucie remarked.</p>

<p></p>
<h2>Shiba Inu Set To Overtake Dogecoin?</h2>
<p>Lucie&#8217;s confidence may be mirrored in another daring prediction by the Shiba Inu team on X, where they assert SHIB&#8217;s potential to eclipse Dogecoin in market capitalization through strategic moves referred to as &#8220;Secret Wags.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reacting to CryptoCom&#8217;s classification of SHIB as the second most valuable meme-inspired project, the Shiba Inu team hinted at a future where SHIB dethrones DOGE, stating, &#8220;[Number] 2 today, but the Doge days are numbered.&#8221;</p>
<p>The competition between SHIB and DOGE is not new; both tokens have vied for dominance in the past. DOGE currently holds the #10 spot in market cap among all cryptocurrencies, with SHIB trailing closely at #11. The market cap gap between DOGE and SHIB stands at $4.14 billion, with DOGE boasting a market cap of $19.41 billion compared to SHIB&#8217;s $15.27 billion.</p>

<p>To reach a new all-time high against its competitor, DOGE, SHIB would need to rally another 50% (SHIB/DOGE), building on the 98% gain against DOGE over the last four weeks.</p>
<img alt="SHIB vs DOGE" class="wp-image-598873 size-full" height="1673" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SHIBDOGE_2024-03-20_14-03-05.png?resize=3628%2C1673" width="3628" />
<p>Despite previous attempts to surpass Dogecoin, the Shiba Inu team remains undeterred, buoyed by the growing utility of the Shiba Inu ecosystem beyond its meme coin origins. The <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/company/shibarium-activity-skyrockets-by-30-with-shiba-inus-soaring-prices/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">development of Shibarium</a>, a blockchain platform offering various utilities for crypto development, and the rallying support of the #ShibaArmy, underline the team&#8217;s determination.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got the #ShibaArmy, #Shibarium, and secret wags we can&#8217;t reveal yet. Get ready for a new top doggo. Much wows incoming! #SHIB,&#8221; the team enthusiastically stated.</p>

<title>Crypto Expert Reveals Why XRP Price Will Rise 1,700% To $10</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/why-xrp-price-rise-1700-to-10/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/why-xrp-price-rise-1700-to-10/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。一位加密领域专家指出，尽管XRP价格在本市场周期表现不佳，但他认为这种加密标记仍有潜力。他预测XRP价格可能上升至10美元，将市值拉至5000亿美元至1万亿美元。与此同时，其他分析师也对XRP在本牛市表现乐观，认为XRP有望实现良好成绩。虽然目前XRP价格为0.58美元，但技术分析师预测其在本市场周期高峰时可能上升至27美元。 <div>
<p>Despite <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-price-action-legal-expert/" rel="nofollow">concerns</a> about the XRP price performance in this market cycle, this crypto expert has elaborated on why he believes the crypto token will still <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-is-primed-for-growth/">record significant gains</a>. He even predicts that XRP could rise to as <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-800-5-90-days/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CXRP%20To%20%245%20In%2090,of%20a%20prolonged%20bull%20market.%E2%80%9D">high as $10</a>. </p>
<h2>Why XRP Price Could Rise To As High As $10</h2>
<p>Nick, the founder of Web3Alert, mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/NCashOfficial/status/1769175168021148074?s=20" rel="nofollow">post</a> that his price range for XRP in this market cycle is between $5 and $10. According to him, this is possible considering that there are predictions that ETH will rise to between <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-to-10000-programmed/" rel="nofollow">$7,500 and $10,000</a> and Bitcoin will rise to between <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/fundstrat-exec-bitcoin-150000/">$100,000 and $150,000</a>. </p>

<p>Nick noted that the XRP price rising to between $5 and $10 would put its market cap at $500 billion and 1 trillion, respectively. That puts the crypto token’s market cap in a similar category to that of Bitcoin and Ethereum, which could be valued as high as $2.9 trillion and $1.2 trillion if their price predictions are fully actualized. </p>
<p>In other words, Nick argues that XRP hitting these prices is not farfetched since there is still much room for growth for the two largest crypto tokens by market cap, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-crypto-analyst-1900/#:~:text=If%20that%20happens%2C%20Ethereum%20could,its%20current%20price%20of%20%241%2C600.">Bitcoin and Ethereum</a>. As those two tokens continue to increase in price, he expects XRP to follow suit. Interestingly, he opined that his XRP prediction is “conservative,” suggesting XRP could go way higher. </p>
<p>Following Nick’s assertion, another X user <a href="https://x.com/Dat_Dude_Derek_/status/1769181926500204741?s=20" rel="nofollow">remarked</a> that comparing XRP to Bitcoin and Ethereum seemed out of place since BTC and ETH’s price prediction is just a 2x, unlike XRP, which will need to see a 10x in its price to hit those targets. Nick <a href="https://x.com/NCashOfficial/status/1769185024329347145?s=20" rel="nofollow">responded</a> that this simply shows that XRP is undervalued and presents a great ROI opportunity in this cycle. </p>
<h2>The Belief In XRP’s Potential</h2>
<p>Nick joins a list of crypto analysts who have expressed optimism about XRP’s potential in this market cycle <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrps-underperformance-ruffles-feathers-as-community-asks-ripple-to-do-something-about-price/" rel="nofollow">despite its underperformance</a> to start this bull run. <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-biggest-ipo-ever/" rel="nofollow">Crypto expert Zach Rector</a> also <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-is-primed-for-growth/">recently shared</a> his belief and gave reasons why XRP is still bound to perform well in this bull market. </p>

<p>Although he didn’t give any price prediction, he alluded to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-ceo-success-for-xrp/" rel="nofollow">XRP’s fundamentals</a> as one reason why he holds this belief. Meanwhile, technical analysts like Egrag Crypto have also made bullish price predictions for XRP heading into this market cycle. Egrag has even gone as far as <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/crypto-4400-xrp-price-27/#:~:text=Crypto%20Analyst%20Predicts%204400%25%20XRP%20Price%20Surge%20To%20%2427%2C%20Here's%20When,-by%20Scott%20Matherson&amp;text=Crypto%20analyst%20Egrag%20Crypto%20continues,this%20is%20a%20real%20possibility.">suggesting</a> that the XRP price could rise to as high as $27 at the peak of this bull run. </p>
<p>At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $0.58, down over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xrp/" rel="nofollow">data</a> from CoinMarketCap. </p>

<title>Altcoins Shows Buy Signals, Massive Opportunity Beckons: Analyst</title>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。当前比特币价格下跌，但市场中仍然有看涨的氛围。专家认为，这是购买另类币的良机，因为另类币市场即将进入另类币季。Michael Van De Poppe强调了另类币市场的重要机会，尤其是ARB。此外，Santiment也提到了几种另类币，如BOUNCE、LDO、OMG、STORJ和SNX，认为这些币可能有利可图。总体而言，尽管另类币市场有所波动，但未来看起来相当有利。 <div>
<p>As the price of Bitcoin (BTC) continues to demonstrate a major fall in valuation, indicating a gloomy attitude toward the crypto asset, the bulls in the market are hopeful that the market will soon enter another <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/altcoin-season-heres-what-glassnode-data/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Season for Altcoins</a>.</p>
<h2>Altcoins Showing Massive Buying Opportunity </h2>
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s recent dip signaled the beginning of the decline in the cryptocurrency market, causing several <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/press-releases/altcoins-wont-stop-pumping-scorpion-casino-vechain-and-theta-network-to-10x-next/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">altcoins</a> to drop significantly. However, many cryptocurrency analysts believe that the drop in these altcoin prices might serve as an opportunity for future gains since the alt-season is on the horizon.</p>

<p>Popular cryptocurrency expert and trader Michael Van De Poppe has <a href="https://x.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1770070969945653502?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">revealed</a> his optimism in the altcoin market, highlighting the significant opportunities of getting into these tokens before the alt-season begins.</p>
<p>According to Michael Van De Poppe, &#8220;some altcoins have now dropped by over 40%&#8221; in comparison to their past all-time high. As a result, Poppe believes that this is the right time for investors to purchase these digital assets to position themselves for future gains.</p>
<p>Poppe noted he normally invests in these tokens “during bull cycles when they are about 25% to 60% less expensive.” This demonstrates the crypto expert&#8217;s confidence in the assets to rally in the coming months.</p>
<p>While pointing out the massive opportunities in the market, Poppe has underscored <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/arbitrum-in-freefall-dips-below-2-as-experts-analyze-recovery-timelines/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Arbitrum (ARB)</a> as one of the altcoins investors should watch out for. He believes that ARB could realize substantial gains in time, as the token is down and poised for a new leg UP.</p>
<img alt="Altcoins" class="size-medium wp-image-598868" height="246" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Michael-Van-De-Poppe-Arbitrum-chart.png?w=460&#038;resize=460%2C246" width="460" />
<p>Recently, there have been notable advancements in the crypto asset&#8217;s price, demonstrating momentum for an upward movement. As of the time of writing, ARB was trading at $1.70, indicating an over 10% increase in the daily timeframe.</p>
<p>However, in the weekly and monthly timeframe, ARB is down by 22% and 15%, respectively. Meanwhile, Arbitrum&#8217;s market capitalization has increased by roughly 10% to exceed the $4.5 billion threshold.</p>
<h2>Top ALTs To Purchase After Bitcoin&#8217;s Retracement</h2>
<p>On-chain analyticS platform Santiment has also <a href="https://x.com/santimentfeed/status/1770249809280237856?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">highlighted</a> the drop in altcoins as a shot to garner profits in the upcoming months. Santiment pointed out several altcoins that offer a &#8220;possible bullish opportunity,&#8221; following <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crash-60800-worst-over-experts/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin&#8217;s crash</a> today to a two-week low of $61,700.</p>

<p>Some of the tokens listed by Santiment are BOUNCE, LDO, OMG, STORJ, and SNX. The MVRV Opportunity and Danger Zone Model, according to Santiment, shows that many altcoins have now declined to the point where mid-term trading returns are in an &#8220;opportunity zone.&#8221; However, when an asset&#8217;s 30-day, 90-day, and 365-day average wallet returns add up to be negative, “this zone is breached.”</p>
<p>Even with the recent general correction, the altcoins market appears to be headed toward a favorable long-term picture. Consequently, this presents an excellent chance for investors to purchase these digital assets at a reduced cost.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Supply On Exchanges Hit 4-Year Low, But Why Is Price Crashing?</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-supply-on-exchanges-2/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-supply-on-exchanges-2/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章强调了比特币基本面的一些关键因素，表明市场已经为进一步增长做好准备。然而，最近的价格下跌引发了对此趋势的关注。数据显示比特币交易所的供应已降至4年低点，投资者似乎无意出售持有的比特币。虽然基本面强劲，但价格下跌可能是由于过度杠杆、以太坊走低和比特币ETF审批前景不明朗等因素导致的。此外，比特币可能正在进入“最后一次减半回调”阶段，在4月的减半事件之前可能会出现价格大幅调整。 <div>
<p>Certain Bitcoin fundamentals suggest the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-price-rise-above-57000/" rel="nofollow">flagship crypto token</a> is well primed for further growth in <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bull-market-glassnode/" rel="nofollow">this bull market</a>. However, its recent price decline has sparked concerns about the reason for this downward trend despite everything pointing to a sustained upward movement. </p>
<h2>Bitcoin Supply On Exchanges Hit 4-Year Low</h2>
<p><a href="https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/65f9a82a0d84564c5d5ce1b0-After-Selloff-Next-Steps-for-Traders-Review-of-Popular-On-Chain-Data" rel="nofollow">Data</a> from the on-chain analysis platform CryptoQuant highlighted that the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-ablaze-data-reveals-robust-demand-for-etfs/" rel="nofollow">supply of Bitcoin on exchanges</a> has seen nearly a 40% drop in 4 years and is reducing ahead of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/why-bitcoin-halving-could-provide-a-big-boost-to-these-altcoins-growth/" rel="nofollow">Bitcoin halving</a>. This underscores the bullish sentiment around the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-ordinals-craze-throws-up-challenges-and-opportunities-for-the-network/" rel="nofollow">Bitcoin ecosystem</a> as the decreasing supply on supply suggests that most investors have no plans to sell their holdings anytime soon. </p>

<p>The CryptoQuant data also noted that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-ablaze-data-reveals-robust-demand-for-etfs/" rel="nofollow">Bitcoin’s demand</a> is outpacing its supply, which is said to have been the prevailing trend since 2020. This development offers a bullish narrative as it can continue to increase Bitcoin’s value since “scarcity boosts perceived value.” This trend is also expected to be sustained once the Halving occurs since miners’ supply <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-supply-shock-57-of-btc-hasnt-moved-2-years/" rel="nofollow">will be cut in half</a>. </p>
<p>Interestingly, the imbalance between Bitcoin’s demand and supply has led crypto analysts like <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-demands-exceeds-supply/">MacronautBTC to believe</a> that BTC’s price could rise to as high as $237,000. As such, there are still high expectations for Bitcoin despite the crypto token hitting a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-breaks-through-69000-setting-new-record/" rel="nofollow">new all-time high (ATH)</a> of $73,750. </p>
<h2>Why Bitcoin’s Price Is Crashing</h2>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/nobody-will-get-rich-investing-in-bitcoin/" rel="nofollow">Crypto analyst Alex Kruger</a> has <a href="https://x.com/krugermacro/status/1770240971223007251?s=20" rel="nofollow">outlined</a> different reasons why Bitcoin’s price is crashing despite its strong fundamentals. The first reason he alluded to was the fact that crypto traders in the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-derivatives-market-volumes-show-bullish-trend-after-2022-downturn/" rel="nofollow">derivatives market</a> look to be overleveraged, possibly because greed seems set to be setting in with traders deploying more capital in anticipation of further price surges. </p>
<p>Kruger mentioned that the ETH could also be dragging the market down with the hopes of the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/crypto/sec-announcement-crypto/#:~:text=What%20The%20SEC's%20Latest%20Announcement%20Means%20For%20The%20Crypto%20Industry,-by%20Scott%20Matherson&amp;text=A%20recent%20announcement%20by%20the,actions%20have%20had%20on%20it.">SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission)</a> approving the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-spot-etfs-sec-commissioner-signals-smooth/" rel="nofollow">Spot Ethereum ETFs</a> waning. Bitcoinist recently reported that the approval odds for these investment funds have plummeted immensely in the past few months, dropping to an alarming 35%. </p>

<p>The third reason that Kruger mentioned is the negative <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/evaluating-performance-bitcoin-etfs-since-launch/" rel="nofollow">Bitcoin ETF inflows</a>, which have become a trend lately. Interest in these Bitcoin funds has cooled off, with investors opting to take profit instead. On March 19, BitMEX Research <a href="https://x.com/BitMEXResearch/status/1770365847925612714?s=20" rel="nofollow">revealed</a> that these ETFs saw a record net outflow of $326m. </p>
<p>Crypto trader and analyst Rekt Capital also <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crashed-65000/#:~:text=The%20flagship%20cryptocurrency%2C%20Bitcoin%2C%20dropped,Halving%2C%20which%20is%20fast%20approaching.">suggested</a> that Bitcoin is already in the ‘Final Pre-Halving Retrace.’ Therefore, significant price corrections can be expected ahead of the Halving event, which is set to take place in April. </p>
<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $63,000, down in the last 24 hours, according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/" rel="nofollow">data</a> from CoinMarketCap. </p>

<title>High-Stakes Week For Bitcoin And Ethereum As Central Bank Decisions Approach: Key Predictions</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/high-stakes-week-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum-as-central-bank-decisions-approach-key-predictions/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/high-stakes-week-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum-as-central-bank-decisions-approach-key-predictions/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。本文讨论了2024年第一季度加密市场和两大加密货币比特币和以太坊可能面临的重要时刻。预计央行将宣布政策，导致市场波动。比特币价格预计波动范围为9.78％，而以太坊短期波动较高，但交易者对其未来表现不太乐观。市场看涨情绪较低，而市场看跌情绪占主导地位。此外，altcoin的杠杆已减少，有助于市场稳定。目前，比特币价格为62500美元，比起24小时前下跌了7.5％；以太坊价格为3276美元，比起24小时前下跌了6.8％。 <div>
<p>This week could mark a pivotal moment in the first quarter of 2024 for the entire crypto market and the two largest cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), as major central banks, led by the Bank of Japan and the US Federal Reserve (Fed), prepare to announce their <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/fomc-preview-bitcoin-crypto-fed-rate-move/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">interest rate decisions</a>. </p>
<p>According to crypto futures exchange Blofin, these announcements will set the tone for monetary policy in the coming months. The impact of safe-haven sentiment has led to a pullback in both BTC and ETH prices, with traders expressing greater optimism for BTC. </p>
<h2>Bitcoin Price Movement Range Projected At 9.78%</h2>
<p>As per a recent on-chain analysis <a href="https://medium.com/@BloFin_Official/blofin-whales-view-week-11-2024-2f4ecc640093" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">report </a>released by the exchange, crypto traders are expecting BTC&#8217;s price movement range to reach 9.78% over the next seven days, with a projected 30-day range of 20.33%. </p>
<p>However, despite the expected volatility, the report indicates that traders remain bullish on BTC in the medium to long term. </p>

<p>Skewness analysis suggests that price declines and pullbacks are expected to induce volatility, but the duration of this round of pullback is expected to be relatively short. Risk aversion to macro uncertainty is seen as the primary trigger. </p>
<p>The latest dealers&#8217; gamma distribution supports the expected wide range of BTC <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crashed-65000/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">price fluctuations</a>, with gamma peaks around $65,000 and $75,000. With the quarterly settlement approaching, market makers&#8217; influence on BTC price movement is gradually recovering, providing support during price drops but making it challenging to surpass the $75,000 level. </p>
<img alt="Bitcoin" class="size-large wp-image-598716" height="382" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot_82.jpg?w=811&#038;resize=811%2C382" width="811" />
<p>In addition, on-chain data shows a decline in spot investors&#8217; enthusiasm for buying BTC, although the number of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/shiba-inu-ecosystem-blooms-bone-jumps-26-with-3-target-in-sight/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">addresses </a>holding more than 100 BTC continues to increase, as seen in the chart above. The reduced number of addresses holding over 1,000 BTC suggests that significant holders have decided to sell at BTC&#8217;s new highs. </p>
<p>Despite caution over potential price fluctuations, the hedging effect contributes to the increasing possibility of BTC price stabilization, making holding BTC a favorable choice.</p>
<h2>Bearish Sentiment Dominates Front-Month Options For Ethereum</h2>
<p>According to the report, similar to BTC, traders expect relatively high volatility levels for ETH in the short term, with projected price movement ranges of 10% over seven days and 20.32% over 30 days. However, the report suggests that traders are less optimistic about ETH&#8217;s future performance compared to Bitcoin. </p>
<p>Furthermore, Blofin finds that bearish sentiment dominates the front-month options, while bullish sentiment remains favorable in the back-months. Blofin emphasizes that expectations of rate cuts may support the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/japans-1-5-trillion-pension-fund-assess-bitcoin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">ETH price</a>, but the pricing of Ethereum tail risk indicates &#8220;increased pessimism&#8221; regarding significant events impacting the ETH price, with spot Ethereum ETFs seen as a potential trigger. </p>

<p>Finally, Blofin explains that the high leverage of altcoins has long been a “source of risk” in the cryptocurrency market. The recent price decline has led to the liquidation of many highly leveraged altcoin positions, resulting in lower annualized funding rates for perpetual contracts. </p>
<p>This deleveraging of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-prediction-0-5850/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">altcoins</a>, coupled with their relatively small market share of less than 20%, has helped to mitigate risk and contribute to market stability, according to the report. However, despite the overall decline in altcoin leverage, speculation in meme coins continues.</p>
<img alt="Bitcoin " class="size-large" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/bMHrh3p8/" width="1815" />
<p>At present, the price of Bitcoin stands at $62,500, reflecting a significant decline of 7.5% within the last 24 hours. Similarly, Ethereum is trading at $3,276, experiencing a 6.8% drop during the same period.</p>

<title>Market Turmoil? Not For XRP: 130% Volume Spike Stuns Investors</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/market-turmoil-not-for-xrp-130-volume-spike-stuns-investors/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/market-turmoil-not-for-xrp-130-volume-spike-stuns-investors/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的<br /> XRP的交易量激增，CoinMarketCap数据显示，24小时内增长130%，达到40亿美元。XRP的价格虽略有下跌至0.605美元，但过去一个月涨幅超过8%。美国证监会与瑞波实验室的有利法院裁决为XRP带来了监管明晰，主要交易所重新列出或宣布恢复与XRP的交易，激发投资者对XRP的热情。交易所如Coinbase、Kraken、Bitstamp和Binance.US的重启或重新列出XRP在提升交易量方面发挥了关键作用。 Coinbase数据显示，XRP价格过去24小时下跌3%，过去一周下跌17%。另一方面，YCharts数据显示，XRP价格为0.6539美元，较前一天增长5.61%，较一年前增长68%。 <div>
<p>The surge in XRP trading volume has been significant, with multiple sources reporting substantial increases over a short period. On March 19, 2024, CoinMarketCap data revealed an increase in <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xrp/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">XRP&#8217;s trading volume</a> by 130% to over $4 billion within 24 hours.</p>

<p>This surge occurred amidst a general market downturn, where XRP&#8217;s trading volume increase helped offset some losses experienced by other assets. Despite a slight decrease in XRP&#8217;s price to $0.605, the asset remained in the green over the last month, showing an increase of more than 8%.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-598814" height="381" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_06adf3.png?resize=1024%2C381" width="1024" /></p>

<h2>Market Developments Trigger Spike</h2>
<p>One of the key drivers behind this <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/company/xrp-rockets-to-the-top-leading-asset-surges-with-5-billion-volume-surge/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">uptick in trading volume</a> is a favorable court ruling between the US Securities and Exchange Commission and Ripple Labs. This ruling provided much-needed regulatory clarity for XRP, leading to major exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken, Bitstamp, and Binance.US either relisting or announcing plans to resume trading with XRP.</p>
<p>The increase in trading volume also reflects an uptick in investor enthusiasm for XRP. The trading volume spike, which at one point constituted over 22% of XRP&#8217;s market capitalization, indicates <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-on-the-crosshair-as-trading-begins-on-us-backed-exchange/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">a strong wave of interest</a> and confidence among investors. Additionally, an impressive price rally in XRP, with the price soaring by nearly 100% at one point, further fueled trading activity as investors capitalized on the price movement.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/LX3TA3dD/" width="2475" /></p>

Exchange Listings Boost Trading Activity
<p>The reopening or relisting of XRP on major exchanges post-court ruling played a pivotal role in boosting trading volume. Exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken, Bitstamp, and Binance.US reopening XRP trading provided traders with increased opportunities, contributing to the boost in overall trading volume.</p>
<p>In the past week, the price of XRP has experienced notable fluctuations, reflecting a mix of ups and downs in the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p>According to Coinbase, XRP&#8217;s price has seen a 3% decrease in the last 24 hours and a significant 17% decline over the past week. This downward trend indicates a challenging week for XRP investors as the price struggled to maintain its position.</p>

Varied Price Data From Different Sources
<p>On the other hand, YCharts data presents a slightly different picture, indicating an XRP price of 0.6539 USD on March 19, 2024. This figure represents a 5.61% increase from the previous day and a significant 68% uptick from one year ago, showcasing a more <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/xrp-on-the-brink-bullish-pattern-or-profit-taking-retreat/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">positive outlook</a> for XRP in the long term.</p>
<p>Investors and traders are closely monitoring XRP&#8217;s development as it works through the uncertainty in the market. A break below the 200-day moving average at $0.57 could be the first sign of impending market decline.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Price Crashes To $60,800: Is The Worst Over? Experts Weigh In</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章讨论了比特币价格暴跌的原因，包括过度杠杆、以太坊对市场情绪的负面影响、比特币 ETF资金流出、以及有关Solana的狂热讨论。多位专家分析了此次下跌的原因，并提出了对未来走势的看法。文中还提到了比特币历史价格波动的方式，指出目前回调的幅度在正常范围内。此外，有关FOMC决策和对市场预期的影响也引起了一些猜测。最后，比特币交易价格为62,979美元。 <div>
<p>Bitcoin has experienced a sharp decline from its March 14 high of over $73,600 to today&#8217;s low of under $60,800, translating to a -17% loss in value. This significant drop has prompted a flurry of activity on social media platforms, particularly X (formerly Twitter), where crypto experts have been fervently discussing the potential reasons behind this downturn and speculating on what the future holds for the world&#8217;s leading cryptocurrency.</p>
<h2>Unpacking The Bitcoin Crash: Expert Opinions</h2>
<p>Alex Krüger, a respected figure in both macroeconomics and crypto, was quick to identify the primary factors contributing to Bitcoin&#8217;s price collapse. According to Krüger, the crash can be attributed to several key factors: excessive leverage in the market, Ethereum&#8217;s negative influence on overall market sentiment due to ETF speculations, a notable decrease in Bitcoin ETF inflows, and the irrational exuberance surrounding <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana-memecoin-presale-gone-wrong-creator-accidentally-burns-10m-whale-makes-huge-profit/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Solana memecoins</a>, which he refers to disparagingly as &#8220;shitcoin mania.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Reasons for the crash, in order of importance </p>
<p>(for those who need them)</p>
<p>#1 Too much leverage (funding matters)#2 ETH driving market south (market decided ETF not passing)#3 Negative BTC ETF inflows (careful, data is T+1)#4 Solana shitcoin mania (it went too far)</p>

<p></p>
<p>WhalePanda, another influential voice within the crypto space, pointed out the alarming rate of ETF outflows, with a record $326 million leaving the market yesterday. This movement has been particularly detrimental to GBTC, which saw outflows of $443.5 million.</p>

<p>In contrast, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-etf-frenzy-blackrock-smashes-expectations-with-788-million-inflows-in-one-day/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Blackrock&#8217;s inflows</a> stood at a mere $75.2 million, marking its second lowest to date. Also, Fidelity saw just $39.6 million in inflows. “Not much to say, this is bad for the price and we&#8217;ll probably see lower now because this news affects the sentiment as well. Let&#8217;s see what the flows are tomorrow. Positive thing is that we&#8217;re roughly 30 days from halving, and GBTC is getting rekt,” he remarked.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Charles Edwards, founder of crypto hedge fund Capriole Investments, <a href="https://twitter.com/caprioleio/status/1770049266532466783" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">provided</a> a historical perspective on Bitcoin&#8217;s recent price move, suggesting that a 20% to 30% pullback is within the norm for Bitcoin bull runs.</p>
<p>“A normal Bitcoin bullrun pullback is 30%. Back in December, we were already in the longest winning streak in Bitcoin&#8217;s history. A 20% pullback here takes us to $59K. A 30% pullback would be $51K. These are all levels we should be comfortable expecting as possibilities,” he stated.</p>
<p>Rekt Capital provided an analysis of Bitcoin&#8217;s price retracements since the 2022 bear market bottom, noting that the current pullback is only the fifth major retrace, with all previous ones exceeding a -20% depth and lasting from 14 to 63 days. In sum, there are two key takeaways about this current retracement</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>The closer Bitcoin gets to a -20% retrace, the better the opportunity becomes.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Retraces need time to fully mature (at least 2-3 weeks, at most 2-months).</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>Alex Thorn, head of research at crypto giant Galaxy Digital had previously <a href="https://twitter.com/intangiblecoins/status/1770132069986820476" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">warned</a> of the likelihood of significant corrections during bull markets, suggesting that the current retrace is relatively standard. “Two weeks ago i warned that big corrections aren’t just possible but *likely* in Bitcoin bull markets. At -15%, this is pretty standard historically. Bull markets climb a wall of worry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Macro analyst Ted (@tedtalksmacro) focused specifically on the implications of the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/fomc-preview-bitcoin-crypto-fed-rate-move/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting</a>. He <a href="https://twitter.com/tedtalksmacro" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">highlighted</a> the massive outflows from spot BTC ETFs, attributing them to traders&#8217; cautious stance ahead of the FOMC decision and the potential impact of tax season in the US.</p>
<p>However, following the drop to $60,800, Ted suggested that the market might have fully priced in the worst-case scenario, hinting at a potential bullish reversal if the FOMC&#8217;s decisions align with market expectations for interest rate cuts by the end of the year. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Time to bid. FOMC hedging done, worst case priced. Only thing that happens from here is that those protective positions unwind into or on the event today. Bulls should step up here soon. [&#8230;] The market has fully priced in another hold from the Fed at today&#8217;s meeting, and is pricing 3 rate cuts from them by the end of the year. Anything that strays away from this from today&#8217;s new economic projection / dot plot material will make the market move sharply.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>At press time, BTC traded at $62,979.</p>

<title>DeFi Turmoil: Over $5 Million Wiped Out In Liquidations Amid Ethereum Price Drop</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/defi-turmoil-over-5-million-wiped-out-in-liquidations-amid-ethereum-price-drop/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/defi-turmoil-over-5-million-wiped-out-in-liquidations-amid-ethereum-price-drop/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。DeFi生态系统在以太坊价格急剧下跌的情况下陷入了崩溃边缘，触发了超过5.4 million美元的强制清算。以太坊价格暴跌至3200美元以下，导致抵押贷款在DeFi协议中面临追加担保要求。在同一时间范围内，数字派生品触发了逾5200万美元的清算。整个加密市场也经历了高度波动，受到即将举行的美联储公开市场委员会（FOMC）会议的影响。以太坊目前正在接近10%的下跌，并且交易量为29百万美元。以太坊未来可能会避免更多下跌，因为看涨情绪在3200美元的支撑水平上巩固，为接下来的恢复奠定基础。 <div>
<p>The decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem teetered on the brink of a meltdown yesterday as cascading liquidations swept through the market following a sharp drop in Ethereum (ETH) price. Over $5.4 million in collateralized assets were forcibly sold off in a 24-hour period, raising concerns about the stability of the DeFi house of cards.</p>

<p>Ethereum, the world&#8217;s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, bore the brunt of the liquidations. Its price plummeted over 9% to below $3,200, a far cry from its recent high of $4,092.</p>
<p>This price swing triggered a domino effect, as collateralized loans used to amplify returns in DeFi protocols faced margin calls. <a href="https://parsec.fi/dashboard" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Data from Parsec</a> paints a bleak picture, with a potential $24 million liquidation event looming if ETH price dips further to $3,008.</p>

<h2><strong>On-Chain Derivatives Spark $52 Million DeFi Liquidation Blitz</strong></h2>
<p>To make matters worse, within the same time frame, major on-chain derivatives have triggered liquidations totaling more than $52 million. After selling at a high of $4,100 for Ethereum, short traders recouped their losses by repurchasing the cryptocurrency at $3,200.</p>
<p>The pain wasn&#8217;t shared equally, however. Panic selling by long position holders, those betting on an ETH price increase, resulted in a whopping $104 million in liquidations compared to a  little over $16 million for short sellers. This imbalance could exacerbate the ETH price decline, creating a negative feedback loop.</p>
<p>The situation highlights the inherent risks associated with leverage in DeFi protocols, While leverage can magnify profits, it can also amplify losses, especially during periods of high volatility.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/LqPlcqUh/" width="2475" /></p>

<p>The bloodbath wasn&#8217;t confined to the DeFi space. The broader crypto market experienced heightened volatility as investors braced for the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. The potential for a Federal Reserve interest rate hike, coupled with weak inflows into Spot Bitcoin ETFs, cast a shadow of bearish sentiment across the digital asset landscape.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-598784" height="431" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_e2ef84.png?resize=633%2C431" width="633" /></p>

<h2><strong>Ethereum Price At A Glance</strong></h2>
<p>Currently, Ethereum (ETH) is experiencing a decline of nearly 10% and is currently trading at $3,138. The 24-hour trading volume for ETH stands at $29 million.</p>
<p>Ethereum had a 20% retracement, making it the second most significant decliner among the top 10 cryptocurrencies. ETH traders maintained their sense of confidence by retaining and mitigating their positions in anticipation of an impending period of recovery.</p>

<p>Based on the prevailing market indicators, it is plausible that the price of Ethereum may evade more drops in the foreseeable future, as the bullish sentiment seeks to consolidate at the support level of $3,200, thereby establishing a foundation for a subsequent phase of recuperation.</p>

<title>BNB Price Could Restart Rally If It Is Able To Hold This Key Support</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/bnb/bnb-price-could-restart-rally-500/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/bnb/bnb-price-could-restart-rally-500/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。BNB价格在$600以上遭遇卖家压力，出现下跌修正并测试重要支撑位$500。价格目前在$515附近并且在4小时图上的100简单移动平均线附近交易。关键的熊市趋势线形成在$520附近，可能阻碍上涨。支撑位在$500、$470和$430，阻力位在$520、$550和$580。技术指标显示MACD处于熊市区间，RSI目前低于50水平。 <div>
<p><em>BNB price rallied further above $600 before it faced sellers. The price corrected gains and now testing an important support at $500.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>BNB price started a downside correction from the $645 resistance zone.</li>
<li>The price is now trading near $515 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $520 on the 4-hour chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance).</li>
<li>The pair could attempt a fresh increase if it stays above the $500 support zone.</li>
</ul>
<h2>BNB Price Holds Support</h2>
<p>In the last BNB price prediction, we discussed the chances of more gains above the $550 resistance zone. The price continued to rise and broke many hurdles near the $580 level.</p>
<p>BNB even outperformed <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-turns-red-62k/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin</a> and <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-bears-aim-3000/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ethereum</a> with a move above the $600 resistance. Finally, it faced resistance near the $645 zone. A high was formed near $645 and the price recently started a downside correction. There was a move below the $600 level.</p>
<p>The price declined below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $365 swing low to the $645 high. The price is now trading near $515 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). Immediate resistance is near the $520 level.</p>
<p>There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $520 on the 4-hour chart of the BNB/USD pair. The next resistance sits near the $550 level. A clear move above the $550 zone could send the price further higher.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Binance-Coin-BNB-2.png?resize=1024%2C461"><img alt="BNB Price" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-598761" height="461" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Binance-Coin-BNB-2.png?resize=1024%2C461" width="1024" /></a></p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BNBUSD/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">BNBUSD on TradingView.com</a></p>
<p>In the stated case, BNB price could test $580. A close above the $580 resistance might set the pace for a larger increase toward the $600 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $645 level in the coming days.</p>
<h2>More Losses?</h2>
<p>If BNB fails to clear the $520 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $500 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $365 swing low to the $645 high.</p>
<p>The next major support is near the $470 level. The main support sits at $430. If there is a downside break below the $430 support, the price could drop toward the $400 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $350 level.</p>
<p>Technical Indicators</p>
<p>4-Hours MACD – The MACD for BNB/USD is gaining pace in the bearish zone.</p>
<p>4-Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BNB/USD is currently below the 50 level.</p>
<p>Major Support Levels – $500, $470, and $430.</p>
<p>Major Resistance Levels – $520, $550, and $580.</p>

<h2>Ethereum Price Breaks Support</h2>

ETH declined below the $3,350 support level to move further in a short-term bearish zone.</p>
<p>Finally, the price traded below the $3,200 support. A low was formed at $3,162 and the price is now consolidating losses. It is showing a few bearish signs below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-extends-losses-3200/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">downward wave</a> from the $3,675 swing high to the $3,162 low.</p>

<p>The next major resistance is near $3,550, above which the price might gain bullish momentum. In the stated case, Ether could rally toward the $3,650 level. If there is a move above the $3,650 resistance, Ethereum could even rise toward the $3,800 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of $4,000.</p>
<h2>More Losses In ETH?</h2>

<title>Ether.fi (ETHFI) Sell-Off Intensifies As Arrington XRP Capital Shifts Holdings To Binance, Will $3 Support Hold?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。Ether.fi的治理代币ETHFI在币安上出现了显著价格下跌，引发了投资者的担忧。然而，最近的链上活动导致了进一步的抛售猜测，可能威胁到代币的稳定性。Arrington XRP Capital在平台上进行了一系列交易活动，引发了对代币价格的担忧。Ether.fi团队对这些猜测做出了回应，表示这些活动是提前知情的，并解释了他们的动机。Arrington Capital也对猜测进行了澄清，并强调他们的行动并未利用协议的分配方法。 <div>
<p>ETHFI, the governance token for the Ether.fi staking protocol has seen a significant drop in price <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ether-fi-210m-airdrop-sparks-market-turbulence-ethfi-value-drops-by-35/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">since its debut</a> on Binance on Monday, March 18. After initially trading at $4.13, the token has lost over 25% of its value, raising concerns among investors. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, recent on-chain activity has fueled speculation of further sell-offs, potentially threatening the token&#8217;s stability and its ability to hold the $3 mark. In particular, blockchain analytics firm Nansen has identified interesting behavior involving Arrington XRP Capital on the Ether.fi platform, highlighting some significant transactions.</p>
<h2>Price Concerns For ETHFI </h2>
<p>In a recent <a href="https://x.com/nansen_ai/status/1769778475341349347?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post </a>on social media site X (formerly Twitter), Nansen&#8217;s analysis reveals interesting activity involving venture capital fund Arrington XRP Capital on the Ether.fi platform. </p>
<p>According to the blockchain analytics firm, Arrington XRP Capital minted 5,000 units of eETH, Ether.fi&#8217;s natively reshaped liquid <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-plunges-64000-on-chain-support/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">staking token</a>. Notably, these eETH tokens were distributed to ten different wallets, each containing 500 units.</p>

<p>Following the distribution, Arrington XRP Capital proceeded to claim a total of 200,498 ETHFI tokens across the ten wallets. The funds were transferred to another address, consolidating the acquired ETHFI tokens. </p>
<p>In the final step of the observed activity, Arrington XRP Capital sent the entire balance of ETHFI tokens to the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/binance-smart-chain/bnb-price-soars-as-binance-smart-chain-implements-bep-336-upgrade-inspired-by-ethereums-dencun/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Binance </a>cryptocurrency exchange, potentially for selling purposes, which could put further pressure on ETHFI.</p>
<p>However, the Ether.fi team has responded to the speculation surrounding the on-chain movements made by Arrington XRP Capital.</p>
<h2>Ether.fi Clarifies </h2>
<p><a href="https://x.com/ether_fi/status/1769880889452872000?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">According </a>to Ether.fi, Arrington XRP Capital has been a consistent investor in the platform and has provided significant support since its inception. The statement further noted that as early adopters and active stakers, the Arrington team has actively staked its assets on Ether.fi, contributing to the platform&#8217;s growth. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-suffers-massive-drop-on-bitmex-bulls-over/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">multi-wallet distribution</a> observed in recent activity did not surprise Ether.fi, as they were reportedly informed of this approach in advance.</p>
<p>Ether.fi claimed that splitting the assets into multiple wallets did not provide additional benefits or change the distribution outcome. The protocol alleged that consolidating the assets into a single wallet would have produced the same results.</p>
<p>The protocol alleged that these assets are part of their liquid funds, which are &#8220;actively traded.&#8221; The decision to transfer the assets to the Binance cryptocurrency exchange was motivated by the nature of their trading activities and liquidity needs, the Ether.fi team concluded.</p>
Arrington Capital Addresses Speculations
<p>The Arrington Capital team also clarified the context through a social media <a href="https://x.com/Arrington_Cap/status/1769889156610609268?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>. They clarified that they had been long-term investors, staking over $50 million of ETH since February 2023. </p>
<p>The company claimed that the recent sale of a &#8220;small percentage&#8221; of its initial airdrop tokens amounted to less than $700,000, allegedly representing only 0.1% of the day&#8217;s trading volume.</p>

<p>Ultimately, Arrington Capital emphasized that their actions were not a “Sybil attack” and did not exploit the protocol&#8217;s distribution methodology. They wrapped up their response by claiming that <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/fomc-preview-bitcoin-crypto-fed-rate-move/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">airdrop </a>distribution follows a linear model that is &#8220;unaffected&#8221; by distribution across multiple wallets.</p>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。CrediBULL Crypto预测了XRP的上涨，指出了XRP/BTC交易对的积累阶段，并预测了15-20%的涨幅。他们也观察到了RSI分歧，显示XRP已经进入了一个可能发生牛市反转的关键区域。其他市场专家也看好XRP的潜力，认为其基本面牢固，有望达到更高的价格目标。尽管最近价格下跌了13%，XRP的交易价格仍然坚挺在0.6美元。 <div>
<p>Recently, a renowned figure in the crypto analysis sphere, CrediBULL Crypto, has <a href="https://twitter.com/CredibleCrypto/status/1769745357599056015?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">spotlighted</a> XRP with a bullish prediction. According to the analyst, XRP is on the verge of a significant rally that could surge its value<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-on-the-crosshair-as-trading-begins-on-us-backed-exchange/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> against Bitcoin</a> in the coming period.</p>
<h2>XRP Price: Anticipating The Surge</h2>
<p>CrediBULL Crypto has been closely monitoring XRP&#8217;s movements against Bitcoin. Through analysis, he observed an interesting trend within the XRP/BTC trading pair that suggests an upcoming uptick.</p>

<p>The key to this prediction is identifying an accumulation phase happening at a lower timeframe within a higher demand zone. This pattern is not new to the analyst, who has identified similar trends.</p>
<p>The insights provided by CrediBULL Crypto indicate a potential 15-20% rally for XRP against Bitcoin in the near term. Should the altcoin break through the next <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/ripple-behind-xrp-price-crash/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">major resistance</a>, which is pegged 35% higher, the analyst believes this could trigger a surge, rewarding investors with returns exceeding 100% against BTC.</p>

<p>A week before this bullish forecast, CrediBULL Crypto had already increased its position on the XRP/BTC pair, driven by an &#8220;RSI divergence&#8221; observed on the 3-day chart. Such divergences are often harbingers of a significant market turnaround, suggesting that the altcoin had entered a pivotal region ripe for a bullish reversal.</p>
<h2>XRP&#8217;s Foundation For Growth</h2>
<p>The potential for XRP isn&#8217;t just a matter of speculative trading. Other market experts have highlighted the cryptocurrency&#8217;s fundamentals. Zach Rector, a prominent voice within the crypto community, has also recognized the altcoin&#8217;s potential.</p>
<p>By drawing parallels with Bitcoin, Rector points out the foundation of XRP and the XRPL, setting the stage for XRP&#8217;s <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-is-primed-for-growth/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">significant impact in the next market upturn</a>.</p>

<p>Analyst Dark Defender also sees a bright future for the altcoin, predicting a<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-to-skyrockets-to-1-33-amidst-april-rally-analysts/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> climb to the $1.33 price level</a> as an immediate target. Moreover, he suggests that reaching the $1.88 and $5.85 Fibonacci targets in the forthcoming weeks is well within the realm of possibility</p>

<p>Meanwhile, despite facing a downturn with a 13% decline, followed by a further 1% drop in the last 24 hours, the altcoin&#8217;s trading price remains resilient at $0.6.</p>

<title>Record-Breaking GBTC Outflows Send Bitcoin Down 14% To $62,000</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。据《财富》杂志报道，比特币价格出现大幅波动，最近从历史最高价下跌14％至62,483美元。格雷斯卡尔公司的比特币信托基金（GBTC）出现创纪录的资金流出超过640万美元，影响了比特币表现。此外，投资者在美国联邦公开市场委员会（FOMC）会议前展现了谨慎态度，密切关注利率变化。此外，加密期货交易者也受到重创，面临超过440万美元的损失。尽管价格出现调整，比特币在过去30天和年初至今的时间段中仍保持相当大的涨幅。 <div>
<p>As <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/03/19/bitcoin-slumps-62000-gbtc-fed-rate-cut-waiting-game/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reported </a>by Fortune Magazine, the cryptocurrency market has been experiencing significant volatility as Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced a sharp decline that has had a domino impact on other cryptocurrencies. The recent drop in the price of Bitcoin, coupled with outflows from Grayscale&#8217;s GBTC, has raised concerns among investors. </p>
<h2>Bitcoin Sees 14% Correction From ATH</h2>
<p>Bitcoin suffered a 14% drop since reaching its <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/breaking-news-ticker/breaking-bitcoin-hits-new-all-time-high-surging-past-70000-for-the-first-time-in-history/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">all-time high</a> (ATH) of $73,700 last week, briefly touching $62,483 on Tuesday morning. However, it recovered and stabilized around $64,900, just below the $65,000 mark. </p>

<p>The decline was attributed to record outflows of over $640 million from Grayscale&#8217;s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). In comparison, other spot Bitcoin ETFs saw inflows of less than $500 million, resulting in a net outflow of $15 million on Monday, <a href="https://x.com/JSeyff/status/1769946247438155909?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">according </a>to Bloomberg ETF expert James Seyffart. </p>
<img alt="Bitcoin " class="size-large wp-image-598723" height="277" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GJAciI_XcAApiWN.png?w=774&#038;resize=774%2C277" width="774" />
<p>This <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-plunges-64000-on-chain-support/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">outflow </a>from GBTC, combined with the cautious sentiment surrounding the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in the US, has had a significant impact on Bitcoin&#8217;s performance.</p>
<p>As recently <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/fomc-preview-bitcoin-crypto-fed-rate-move/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">reported </a>by NewsBTC, investors exhibited caution ahead of the FOMC meeting, closely monitoring the potential changes in interest rates. Recent higher-than-expected inflation data, as indicated by the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI), dampened expectations of interest rate cuts. </p>
<p>According to Fortune, the CME FedWatch Tool projected a 99% likelihood of rates remaining unchanged, further affecting <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crashed-65000/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">market sentiment.</a> Per the report, investors were keen to gauge the Federal Reserve&#8217;s stance on monetary policy, contributing to the cautious trading environment.</p>
<p>In the same context, the Bank of Japan raised its key interest rate from -0.1% to 0% to 0.1% in response to rising consumer prices. This was the first rate increase in 17 years.</p>
<h2>Crypto Futures Traders Take A Hit</h2>
<p>The drop in Bitcoin&#8217;s price had a cascading effect on other cryptocurrencies. Major altcoins like <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-extends-losses-3200/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ethereum </a>(ETH) and Solana (SOL) experienced significant declines of 8.1% and 12.5% over the past 24 hours, respectively. </p>
<p>Meme coins, including Floki Inu (FLOKI), Bonk Inu (Bonk), and Dogecoin (DOGE), also suffered losses of 34%, 28.5%, and 24.8%, respectively, during the past week. </p>

<p>The decline in cryptocurrency prices resulted in over $440 million worth of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-etf-crypto-liquidations/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">liquidations </a>for traders of crypto futures. Traders who had leveraged positions betting on higher prices faced significant losses. Most of these liquidations occurred on Binance, totaling $212 million, followed by OKX at $170 million. </p>
<img alt="Bitcoin " class="size-large" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/s9TU7X4K/" width="1815" />
<p>Despite its price correction, BTC retains substantial gains of over 26% and 132% in the past thirty days and year-to-date timeframe, respectively.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Halving Retrace Spooks Investors: What Is It And Why Does It Matter?</title>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章介绍了加密货币市场在过去一天出现意外发生的全面下跌，但Rent Capital预测到了这种情况，指出这与比特币已建立的减半趋势相符。分析表明，比特币在减半之前的月份遵循的趋势，通常会出现价格崩盘。根据之前的数据，比特币价格在减半前的一个月内通常会下跌约20%至38%，这次可能会下跌大约25%。价格崩盘是比特币价格遵循已建立的减半趋势的证实，也预示着即将到来的牛市。这种崩盘也被认为是最后一次以最低价格入场的机会。最近，比特币价格在63,500美元附近交易，但在日图上下跌5.91％，在周图上下跌12.19％。 <div>
<p class="p2">The <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crashed-65000/">Bitcoin price crash </a>over the past day has taken crypto investors by surprise, leading to a full bleed day for the industry. However, while this may have come as a shock to many, some were able to call it out ahead of time. One of those is Rent Capital, which said the decline was in line with Bitcoin’s established halving trend.</p>
<h2 class="p2">An Expected Crash</h2>
<p class="p2">The analysis <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crashed-65000/">posted</a> by Rest Capital outlines the trends that Bitcoin has followed leading up to its halving months. In 2020, the halving fell on the month of May and in the month leading up to the rally, the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crashed-65000/">Bitcoin price</a> saw an approximately 20% decline.</p>

<p class="p2">Over the years, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-approaches-risky-territory-as-halving-event-draws-near/">Bitcoin has followed similar patterns</a> to usher in the anticipated halving and while there has been some deviation this time around, the digital asset looks to be maintain some trends. One of these trends is the price crash before the halving.</p>
<p class="p2">As Rekt Capital’s analysis shows, Bitcoin is right in region of where this crash is expected to happen. The previous trends have seen the price fall between 20% and 38% in the month before the halving. So taking this into account, the BTC price could crash around 25% on average if it sticks to this trend.</p>
<p class="p2">The crypto analyst also revealed their target for if Bitcoin follows this trend. The crash is expected to push the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-suffers-massive-drop-on-bitmex-bulls-over/">BTC price</a> below the $40,000. However, if the average plays out, then the price could bottom out above $40,000 before rebounding.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Why This Crash Is Important For Bitcoin</h2>
<p class="p2">The crash is a confirmation that the Bitcoin price is following the established pre-halving trend and also confirms the incoming bull market. Going by the previous trends, the halving takes place after the crash, following which there is some upside the is seen with the cryptocurrency.</p>

<p class="p2">Then, in the months following the halving, there is massive accumulation that serves as a precursor to the bull market. In this case, this accumulation is expected to begin sometime in April 2024 and then continue on for a few months.</p>
<p class="p2">The crash, as Rekt Capital points out, also serves as the last opportunity for <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/fomc-preview-bitcoin-crypto-fed-rate-move/">cryptocurrency investors</a> to get into position at the lowest prices. This is because once the halving is complete and the bull market begins, low prices become a thing of the past.</p>
<p class="p2">At the time of writing, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-suffers-massive-drop-on-bitmex-bulls-over/">the BTC price</a> is seeing minor recovery from its crash below $63,000. It I trading at $63,500, but with a 5.91% decline on the daily chart and a 12.19% decline on the weekly chart, according to CoinMarketCap.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Might Be Poised For A  ‘Double Pump Cycle,’ Reveals Analyst – Here’s Why</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。加密分析师Willy Woo预测比特币将迎来稀有的“双泵”周期，预计2024年中和2025年将出现两次重要价格涨幅。尽管BTC最近经历了10%的下跌，但解决下跌势头的关键需求区在61,000美元，可能会吸引机构投资者。同时，根据加密分析师Charles Edwards的观察，BTC在特许的牛市拉回幅度约为30%，因此下跌至59,000美元甚至51,000美元的水平也是可能的购买机会。 <div>
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s recent downturn has prompted renowned crypto analyst Willy Woo to offer a fresh <a href="https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1770048197584683412?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">perspective</a> on the cryptocurrency&#8217;s future trajectory. Woo&#8217;s analysis, based on the surge in Bitcoin&#8217;s Macro Index, suggests an optimistic outlook for the leading digital currency, potentially indicating a pivotal shift in market dynamics.</p>
<h2>Unveiling Bitcoin Double Pump Prediction</h2>
<p>Willy Woo, a figure well-respected in the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/planbs-bitcoin-forecast-a-journey-to-5-million/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">cryptocurrency analysis</a> sphere, has recently shared insights that paint an intriguing future for Bitcoin.</p>

<p>According to Woo, the notable increase in the Bitcoin Macro Index could signal more than just a recovery; it might be the precursor to a rare &#8220;double pump&#8221; cycle.</p>
<img alt="Bitcoin Macro Index" height="649" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GJB5LsKbkAAajAz?format=jpg&amp;name=medium" width="1200" />
<p>Drawing parallels with the market patterns 2013, Woo&#8217;s forecast points towards two significant price surges for Bitcoin in the coming years. He anticipates the first peak by mid-2024 and a second, even more substantial top in 2025.</p>
<p>This dual surge scenario, though historically uncommon, aligns with Woo&#8217;s analysis of current market conditions and Bitcoin&#8217;s intrinsic <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/japans-1-5-trillion-pension-fund-assess-bitcoin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">growth potential</a>.</p>

<h2>Navigating Through The Bearish Terrain</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, the past week has not been kind to BTC, with the asset experiencing a roughly 10% decline. This downward trend extended over the past 24 hours, seeing Bitcoin&#8217;s value <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crashed-65000/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">dip</a> by 4.9%, bringing its <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-plunges-64000-on-chain-support/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">price to around $65,000</a>—a sharp fall from its recent peak above $73,000.</p>
<img alt="Bitcoin (BTC) price chart on TradingView" class="size-medium" height="1556" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/RvnsCvxk/" width="2770" />
<p>Amid this bearish price action, IntoTheBlock, a notable crypto analytics firm, suggests the $61,000 level as a critical demand zone, highlighted by the significant volume of Bitcoin purchased at this price point.</p>
<p>This area is deemed attractive for accumulation by institutional investors and large-scale traders, suggesting a possible recovery in the near future.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Bitcoin is looking for support. But where will it find it?

<p>Additionally, as Bitcoin navigates its<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/fomc-preview-bitcoin-crypto-fed-rate-move/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> current market challenges</a>, cryptocurrency analyst Charles Edwards points out that a typical pullback during a Bitcoin bull run amounts to about 30%.</p>

<p>With BTC having experienced its longest winning streak in history, a corrective dip to $59,000 or even $51,000, as per some predictions, remains within the realm of possibility.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">A normal Bitcoin bullrun pullback is 30%. Back in December, we were already in the longest winning streak in Bitcoin&#8217;s history. A 20% pullback here takes us to $59K.

<p>These levels represent potential buying opportunities for investors looking to capitalize on Bitcoin&#8217;s cyclical nature and its anticipated ascension post-pullback.</p>

<title>Crypto Presale Frenzy Raises Over $122M Worth Of SOL In A Week</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。加密货币市场下跌，导致大多数加密货币出现红色数字。投资者转向预售狂潮，尝试从MEME代币中获利。截至3月12日以来，预售已筹集122.5万美元。27个基于Solana的MEME代币预售项目吸引了巨额资金，但许多项目在推出后迅速衰退。投资者面临损失，而欺诈者也利用这一趋势进行钓鱼诈骗。这种趋势可能导致MEME代币疲劳，对长期稳定性有害。 <div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The crypto market is down as most cryptocurrencies have registered red numbers for the past few days. Expectations of making big profits out of the bullish sentiment are momentarily halted. And while many patiently wait for the prices to rise again, others are seemingly looking for different options to make their bags.</p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto Presale Frenzy Sees Big Numbers</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The “<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solanas-biggest-memecoin-gains-681000-in-3-days-as-more-investors-bet-on-its-popularity/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">memecoin mania</a>” has been at the forefront of the market, stealing the spotlight since February. As a result, investors might see a window of opportunity to profit from these tokens.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">During the previous bull cycle, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) were at the center of the stage, with millions of dollars invested in the tokens. This time, the biggest memecoins by market cap are being outshined by some of the newer players.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Dogwifhat and other <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-tokens-among-top-gainers-jup-and-wen-soar-over-12-wif-hits-new-ath/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Solana-based tokens</a> have led the way during this leg, registering massive gains in the last month. Recently, the presale and launch of Book of MEME (BOME), which started as a small experimental project, saw its surge to a $1 billion market cap in a few days.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The memecoin surge has now turned into a memecoin presale frenzy, with presale launching left and right after becoming the “meta” of the market.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The meta term, borrowed from the gaming community, refers to the Most Effective Tactic Available. As such, investors and scammers are equally attempting to take profit off the trend.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto investigator ZachXBT revealed on X that the current “presale meta” trend has raised $122.5 million since March 12. Taking the BOME project as a starting point, the crypto detective counted 27 different presales from Solana-based memecoins since that date. These projects raised approximately 655,000 SOL, according to the crypto sleuth calculations.</p>

<p></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">To put the numbers into perspective, ZachXBT highlighted that these figures only account for the projects on the Solana chain in the last seven days. This means that the calculations are only one part of the bigger image as the presales before March 12, and chains like Ethereum, Base, and BSC are excluded.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Memecoins Raising Millions In Minutes</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest raiser on the list was the SMOLE token by visual artist Dekadente. This project received 169,982 SOL during the presale and has seen notable support from the community.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, the recently launched Slerf raised over 50,000 SOL. However, the token faced a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana-memecoin-presale-gone-wrong-creator-accidentally-burns-10m-whale-makes-huge-profit/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">dramatic launch</a> after its creator accidentally burned the tokens reserved for the presale participants airdrop.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the presales <a href="https://twitter.com/ozempicsol/status/1769885246642954430" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">raised millions</a> in a matter of minutes, which hints at impressive participation from the crypto community. However, many <a href="https://x.com/Ape848/status/1769973480731082808?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">suggest</a> that the massive figures raised come from “fabricated fomo” and “insiders sending sol that they’ll eventually get back.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Despite raising millions in SOL, the presale meta trend left investors with nothing. As the investigator highlights, many of the presales on his list have seen a “hard rug” or the tokens’ momentum quickly fading after launch. As a result, the presale participants’ investments vanished or diminished considerably.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">depends if you mean hard rug or just presale contributors down bad</p>
<p>&mdash; ZachXBT (@zachxbt) <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1769952372581626051?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">March 19, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, scammers have taken their chance to profit off the presale frenzy. Phishing scams under the presale posts have skyrocketed, with impersonating accounts trying to drain investors’ wallets or collect whatever amount people meant to send to the presale addresses.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Members of the crypto community have expressed their concerns over the presale trend. Many crypto investors consider the trend might create memecoin fatigue, which <a href="https://twitter.com/barkery91/status/1769626690538320018" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">could hurt</a> the organic projects aiming for long-term stability.</p>

<title>Injective Launches Important Token Tool As INJ Bleeds</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/injective/injective-launches-important-token-tool-as-inj-bleeds/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/injective/injective-launches-important-token-tool-as-inj-bleeds/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。Injective Protocol推出了TokenStation，允许用户在其主网上创建原生代币，降低了代币创建的门槛。此外，与Volan合作升级了INJ代币经济学，使其逐渐紧缩。此外，与Rollup Technologies的合作有望提高Injective的安全性。尽管Injective在DeFi领域的声誉有所提升，并与Ethereum等平台进行合作，但其总锁定价值（TVL）相对较低，而INJ价格受到一定压力。 <div>
<p>Injective Protocol, a decentralized finance-centric platform, has launched TokenStation. In a <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.tokenstation.app/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> on March 18, Injective said the solution, deployed on its mainnet, allows users to launch native tokens. With this tool, Injective said it would empower anyone to create their tokens in a low-fee and scalable environment.</p>
<h2>Injective Launches TokenStation, Strikes Key Partnership</h2>
<p>The tool was developed by the Injective community and aims to &#8220;remove barrier to entry for token creation.&#8221; Like the token creation tools on Solana and Ethereum, for example, using TokenStation, part of the blog post won&#8217;t require coding experience. </p>
<p>Related Reading: <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crashed-65000/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Top Reasons Why The Bitcoin Price Crashed Below $63,000</a></p>
<p>This makes it easier for individuals and projects to launch on Injective. Beyond token minting, the tool allows token management and integration of tokenomics mechanisms like burning.</p>
<p>The blockchain is launching the TokenStation days after partnering with <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://blog.injective.com/en/injective-and-altlayer-bring-restaking-security-to-evm-applications/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">AltLayer</a>, a platform backed by Binance Labs dedicated to developing roll-up technology for Ethereum. Through this collaboration, the two will build a re-staking security framework for Injective Ethereum Virtual Machine (inEVM) applications.</p>
<p>The recently launched inEVM allows developers to seamlessly build applications leveraging the high scalability and near-zero fees on Injective. Additionally, the inEVM is set to increase composability between WebAssembly (WASM) and EVM environments. Through this unique feature, Injective can bridge the interoperability of Cosmos, the developer activity of Ethereum, and the high scalability of Solana. </p>
<h2>Will Volan Help Prop Up INJ Prices?</h2>
<p>In January, Injective Protocol <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://blog.injective.com/en/a-new-era-of-injective-the-volan-mainnet-upgrade/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">activated</a> the Volan Upgrade, setting the platform&#8217;s plans to build a robust real-world tokenization infrastructure into motion. Part of this was the introduction of a Real-World Asset (RWA) module. In this way, institutions can launch regulatory-compliant security tokens. </p>
<p>Additionally, Volan modified INJ tokenomics, making the token progressively deflationary. Burning reduces INJ tokens over time, a measure adopted by other protocols, including BNB and Ethereum.</p>

<p>While the upgrade and subsequent partnerships have lifted its prominence in decentralized finance (DeFi), growth has been slower than expected. </p>
<img alt="Injective TVL | Source: DeFiLlama" class="size-full wp-image-598677" height="354" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot592.png?resize=1024%2C354" width="1024" />
<p>So far, DeFiLlama data <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://defillama.com/chain/Injective" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">shows</a> that Injective Protocol commands a total value locked (TVL) of less than $65 million. This is miles behind Solana or Ethereum, two of the world&#8217;s most active smart contract platforms where active DeFi protocols also thrive.</p>
<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/x/T5jUkfpP/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="Injective prices trending downward on the daily chart | Source: INJUSDT on Binance, TradingView" class="size-full" height="904" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/T5jUkfpP/" width="1787" /></a>
<p>Meanwhile, INJ prices, although relatively higher, are under pressure, as seen in the candlestick arrangement in the daily chart. INJ is down 30% from 2024 highs, slipping and following <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crashed-65000/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin</a>. However, the coin is within a broader consolidation. Resistance and support levels are around $44 and $30, respectively.</p>

<title>Crypto Report Says ‘Alameda Gap’ Is Gone After Bitcoin Rally, What This Means</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/crypto-alameda-gap-bitcoin-rally/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/crypto-alameda-gap-bitcoin-rally/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />最近的研究报告指出了过去影响比特币和加密市场的“阿拉米达鸿沟”，但现在该鸿沟似乎已经消失。阿拉米达鸿沟源自Alameda的倒闭，导致市场缺乏流动性。然而，市场已经恢复了，比特币的市场深度几乎已完全恢复。比特币在价值上的表现胜过黄金，吸引了更多投资者。从长期来看，人们可能将黄金视为比特币的替代品。<br /> <div>
<p>In its most recent research newsletter, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-as-one-of-the-best-performing-assets-report/" rel="nofollow">crypto research firm Kaiko</a> alluded to an ‘Alameda Gap,’ which has been massively impacting the Bitcoin and crypto market for some time now. However, that seems to be in the past, as Kaiko stated that the gap no longer exists. </p>
<h2>What The Alameda Gap Is About</h2>
<p>According to the <a href="https://research.kaiko.com/insights/eth-lags-post-upgrade" rel="nofollow">report</a>, the ‘Alameda Gap’ is the gap in liquidity that existed after the collapse of the collapse of the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/major-reveals-from-the-ftx-bankruptcy-filing-whats-the-takeaway/">defunct crypto exchange FTX</a> and its sister company <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/blockfi-resolves-dispute-with-ftx-alameda-research/" rel="nofollow">Alameda Research</a>. Alameda was one of the most prominent market makers then and provided massive liquidity to the market. </p>

<p>Following Alameda’s collapse, this liquidity gap is said to have persisted as market makers “waited on the sidelines for sentiment and trading activity to recover.” Now, the market looks to have moved past this, as Kaiko revealed that, as of last week, the market depth has almost fully recovered and is back to its <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-collapse-sam-bankman-fried-trial/" rel="nofollow">pre-FTX average</a>. </p>
<p>The research firm added that the Bitcoin 2% market depth is up 40% year-to-date (YTD) and briefly surpassed its pre-FTX average of $470 million. This increase is said to have been mainly due to the surge in Bitcoin’s price, which has risen faster than the market liquidity since the SEC approved the Spot Bitcoin ETFs in January. </p>
<p>Bitcoin is up about 50% YTD and has already hit new highs since the beginning of the year, including a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-breaks-through-69000-setting-new-record/" rel="nofollow">new all-time high (ATH)</a> of $73,750. Meanwhile, the improvement in liquidity is also evident in the fact that the cost of trading has declined on the three major US crypto exchanges: Coinbase, Kraken, and Bitstamp. </p>
<h2>How Bitcoin Is Outperforming Gold</h2>
<p>Kaiko also highlighted in its report that the Bitcoin-to-Gold ratio, which measures both assets’ relative performance, is inching closer to its ATH, which it last hit in November 2021. Interestingly, this increase means that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/spot-bitcoin-etf-flows-flip-gold-capital-rotation/" rel="nofollow">BTC is outperforming Gold</a>, even though <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-and-gold-hit-record-breaking-milestones/" rel="nofollow">both assets have recorded ATHs</a> these past few weeks. </p>

<p>Furthermore, funds linked to these assets show how Bitcoin has outperformed Gold. Kaiko noted that Bitcoin ETFs have attracted $11 billion since they launched in early January. Meanwhile, the largest <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/spot-bitcoin-etf-flows-flip-gold-capital-rotation/" rel="nofollow">physically-backed Gold ETFs</a> (SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) and iShares Gold Trust (IAU) have <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/gold-out-bitcoin-in-etf-investors-flock-to-btc/" rel="nofollow">registered outflows</a> during the same period. </p>
<p>Kaiko suggested that this could mean that investors were moving towards Bitcoin as the “new global store of value.” Interestingly, the CEO of Jan3 and Bitcoiner, Samson Mow, while giving reasons why Bitcoin will hit $1 million, also <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-reach-1-million/#:~:text=Mow%20mentioned%20during%20an%20interview,demand%20far%20exceeds%20its%20supply.">mentioned</a> that people will start demonetizing Gold and substitute it for BTC at some point.  </p>

<title>AVAX Price Soars To Highest In Nearly 2 Years, Over 80% Of Holders In Profit</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/avalanche/avax-price-soars-to-highest-in-nearly-2-years-over-80-of-holders-in-profit/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/avalanche/avax-price-soars-to-highest-in-nearly-2-years-over-80-of-holders-in-profit/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。Avalanche (AVAX)在过去一周表现出色，在数字资产中成为表现最佳的加密货币之一，并达到了近两年来的最高价格。AVAX从市场信号中获得了提振，包括持有人的利润增加，大宗交易量增加，现货市场需求增加，以及期货合约的开放利息上升。市场观察家对AVAX的未来走势持谨慎乐观态度，未来有望建立在$70附近，但可能会遇到阻力。 <div>
<p>Avalanche (AVAX), the 10th-ranked cryptocurrency, has been on a tear in the past week, not only emerging as the top performer among major digital assets but also reaching its highest price point in nearly two years.</p>

<p>According to CoinMarketCap data, AVAX surged by an impressive 20%, surpassing its previous peak in May 2022 and reaching a<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/avalanche" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> price of $60</a> at the time of writing. This remarkable rally has ignited a wave of bullish sentiment within the crypto community.</p>
<h2><strong>AVAX Gets Boost From Strong Market Signals </strong></h2>
<p>Analysts are pointing to a confluence of on-chain activity and market signals that paint a bullish picture for AVAX. NewsBTC&#8217;s analysis revealed<a href="https://app.intotheblock.com/coin/AVAX" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> a key factor:</a> 84% of AVAX holders are currently sitting on profits, signifying a wave of positive sentiment within the investor community. This profitable position fosters a more optimistic environment, potentially attracting new buyers to the market.</p>

<p>Digging deeper into on-chain data, market observers at NewsBTC noticed a significant rise in large buy orders on the Avalanche network. This trend suggests that institutional investors or whales might be accumulating AVAX, potentially fueling the upward price movement.</p>
<p>The bullish momentum isn&#8217;t confined to on-chain activity. The spot market is also exhibiting strong demand for AVAX. <a href="https://coinalyze.net/avalanche/open-interest/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Coinalyze data</a> indicates a steady rise in the token&#8217;s Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) since March 17th. CVD is a metric that gauges the difference between buying and selling volumes, and its current uptick suggests a clear dominance of buying pressure in the spot market.</p>

<h2><strong>Positive Vibes In The Air For AVAX</strong></h2>
<p>The derivatives market is echoing the optimism as well. Open Interest (OI) in AVAX futures contracts has been on an upward trajectory, reflecting a growing interest from investors looking to leverage the potential price increase.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that OI doesn&#8217;t necessarily indicate a long-biased market (where more traders are betting on a price rise), but rather highlights increased participation from both buyers and sellers.</p>
<p>However, the rising price alongside surging OI suggests that buyers are currently more aggressive, potentially leading to a breakout above resistance levels.</p>

<p>With this bullish tailwind propelling AVAX forward, analysts are cautiously optimistic about its future trajectory. Some market observers are of the opinion that AVAX has the potential to reach $70 soon.</p>
<p>However, they acknowledge the presence of a psychological hurdle at $70, where the price might encounter some resistance before continuing its climb. If the bulls can overcome this <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/avax-slips-adding-tension-to-365-million-avalanche-token-unlock-drama/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">obstacle</a> and achieve a decisive breakout, the bullish target of $75 might be within reach.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/BNhoEiw8/" width="1835" /></p>

<p>Looking at the potential downside risks, the article warns of a possible rejection at $70, which could trigger a price correction back down to $63. The report also emphasizes that the predicted upswing might not be a linear path, with potential price fluctuations along the way.</p>

<p>Avalanche (AVAX) is experiencing a period of strong momentum, buoyed by positive on-chain data, a surge in investor interest, and a bullish market sentiment. While some resistance levels and potential price corrections are to be expected, the overall outlook for AVAX appears promising in the near future.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Plunges Under $63,000, Here’s Where Next On-Chain Support Is</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-plunges-64000-on-chain-support/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-plunges-64000-on-chain-support/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。比特币价格下跌至63000美元以下，可能在61100美元、56685美元和51530美元的支撑水平处找到支持。另一方面，66990美元和72880美元的高成本基础水平可能会成为阻力。这些支撑和阻力水平基于链上数据，显示了投资者的购买活动，可能影响价格走势。BTC价格已下跌至62700美元，接近首个主要链上支撑水平。 <div>
<p>Bitcoin has deepened its decline in the past day with its price now slipping below $63,000. Here&#8217;s where the next potential support is, according to on-chain data.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Could Find Support At These Price Levels</h2>
<p>In a new <a href="https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1769979649600172220" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, analyst Ali has discussed how the Bitcoin support and resistance levels are looking like right now based on on-chain data from Glassnode.</p>
<p>The indicator of relevance here is the &#8220;<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/analyst-expect-decline-30220-bitcoin-loses-support/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">UTXO Realized Price Distribution</a>&#8221; (URPD), which, in short, tells us about the amount of coins (or more precisely, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-utxo-mid-long-term-holders-november-correction/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">UTXOs</a>) that were last purchased at any given price level that the asset has visited in its history so far.</p>

<p>Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the data for this distribution for the price levels around the recent spot value of the cryptocurrency:</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin URPD" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="1286" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GJA6duNWMAAECTA?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096" width="2404" /></p>

<p>From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that there are a few price levels not far from the current one that particularly stands out in terms of the amount of buying that took place at them.</p>
<p>In on-chain analysis, the potential for any level to act as support or resistance is based on the total number of coins that have their cost basis at the level in question.</p>
<p>Levels thick with coins that are situated under the current price would be probable to act as points of support, while those above the spot value could prove to be resistance walls.</p>
<p>As is apparent from the graph, the $61,100, $56,685, and $51,530 levels are the ones below the current price that hold the cost basis of a notable amount of the supply right now. Naturally, this means that should the decline continue further, these would be the levels to watch for a possible rebound.</p>
<p>Two levels above, however, are even larger than all three of these support levels: the cost basis centers around $66,990 and $72,880. Interestingly, the latter of these is the single largest acquisition level out of all the price levels listed in the chart, implying that a large amount of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-fomo-533330-addresses-bought-70180/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">FOMO buying</a> has occurred at the asset&#8217;s all-time high levels.</p>
<p>In the scenario that Bitcoin regains its upward momentum, these levels of high cost basis population would be where the asset could be most probable to find some trouble.</p>
<p>Now, as for why acquisition centers are considered relevant for support and resistance in on-chain analysis is the fact that investors are likely to show some kind of reaction when a retest of their cost basis takes place.</p>

<p>When such a retest is from above, the holders may decide to accumulate more, believing that the price will go up again in the future. On the other hand, they may sell instead if the retest is from below, as they may think exiting at break-even is better than risking another drop.</p>
<p>A large number of coins having their cost basis at the same level means a potentially large degree of one of these reactions happening and, hence, a strong support or resistance effect on the price.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>Bitcoin is inching closer to the first major on-chain support level as it has now dropped to $62,700.</p>

<title>Dogecoin Growth Hits Roadblock As Holder Activity Enters Dreaded Period Of Stagnancy</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-growth-holder-activity/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-growth-holder-activity/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。Dogecoin和其他主要热门炒作加密货币的地址数量增长速度已经减缓，尤其是在3月份。Dogecoin仅在本月新增了6万个地址，与2月份新增45万个地址的情况形成鲜明对比。其他热门炒作加密货币，如SHIB和PEPE，也没有看到持有者数量的增长。目前，DOGE的价格为约0.12美元，下跌近14%。这可能表明市场对炒作加密货币的关注正在减弱。 <div>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-5-3-million-holders-compares-top-coins/" rel="nofollow">The Dogecoin (DOGE) network</a> has entered a period of stagnancy, as the number of addresses holding the meme coin has slowed. This is a stark contrast to February and January, when the network experienced a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-doge-path-to-0-2/#:~:text=The%20Dogecoin%20adoption%20trend%20has,added%20in%20a%20single%20week.">significant expansion</a>. </p>
<h2>Dogecoin Has Added Only 60,000 New Addresses In March</h2>
<p><a href="https://app.santiment.net/charts/iXhlYy3R__sCl" rel="nofollow">Data</a> from the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/why-these-2-altcoins-could-witness-price-bumps/" rel="nofollow">market intelligence platform Santiment</a> shows that the total number of DOGE holders has increased by only 60,000 since the beginning of this month. At the start of the month, 6.51 million users were holding the meme coin, with this figure only increasing to 6.57 million since then.</p>

<p>This is unlike February when the total number of DOGE holders rose from 5.92 million to 6.51 million. Specifically, around this same time last month, the network had already seen an increase of 450,000 in the total number of addresses holding DOGE. Meanwhile, NewsBTC <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-doge-path-to-0-2/#:~:text=The%20Dogecoin%20adoption%20trend%20has,added%20in%20a%20single%20week.">reported</a> that over 400,000 new addresses were added in two weeks between January and February. </p>
<p>Dogecoin also set a new record in January alone when <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-doge-ready-to-pop/#:~:text=Dogecoin%20(DOGE)%20is%20getting%20ready,be%20added%20for%20it%20soon.">247,240 new DOGE addresses</a> were created on January 29. <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-analyst-predicts-1300-for-cardano/" rel="nofollow">Crypto analyst Ali Martinez</a> noted that a sustained uptrend in the network’s expansion “could soon reflect positively” on DOGE’s price. That underscores how significant the number of addresses holding the meme coin is. </p>
<p>The stagnancy in Dogecoin’s holder activity might also come as a surprise to some in the crypto community, considering the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/top-ai-meme-coins/" rel="nofollow">meme coin frenzy</a> that has taken the crypto space by storm. However, a plausible explanation is that meme coin traders aren’t necessarily invested in the prominent meme tokens but have their eyes on the undervalued gems. </p>
<h2>How Other Top Meme Coins Have Fared</h2>
<p>Data from Santiment also shows that the other two meme coins, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/big-moves-for-shiba-inu-pepe/" rel="nofollow">Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe (PEPE)</a>, which make up the top three largest meme coins by market cap, haven’t fared better. <a href="https://app.santiment.net/charts/iXhlYy3R__sCl" rel="nofollow">Shiba Inu</a> hasn’t seen its holder count increase since the beginning of the month, with the total number of users holding the meme coin still at 1.38 million. </p>

<p>On the other hand, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/similarities-dogecoin-and-pepe/" rel="nofollow">PEPE</a> still has less than 200,000 holders despite boasting a year-to-date (YTD) gain of over 370%. These figures place <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-shiba-inu-pepe-metric/" rel="nofollow">DOGE firmly ahead</a> of SHIB and PEPE in terms of the number of users they all have.

<title>Bitcoin Suffers Massive Drop On BitMEX, Is The Rally Over?</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-suffers-massive-drop-on-bitmex-bulls-over/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-suffers-massive-drop-on-bitmex-bulls-over/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要: 这些信息是消极的。本文讨论了比特币在BitMEX交易所上的急剧下跌到8,900美元的事件，导致市场普遍下滑。一位用户卖出400个比特币导致价格急剧下跌，引发了一系列价格波动。比特币价格从68,000美元下跌至8,900美元，随后恢复正常。彼得·施菲夫预测比特币可能会出现更大的崩盘。当前比特币价格为62,943美元，24小时内下跌7%。 <div>
<p>Since Bitcoin (BTC) witnessed a crash this week to $64,000, the crypto asset has not been able to reclaim its momentum, with the price falling <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-at-risk-65k/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">even lower.</a> This has led to a general market decline that has affected altcoins.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Plummets To $8,900 On BitMEX Exchange</h2>
<p>In a devastating turn of events, Bitcoin witnessed a steep decline on the Seycelles-based cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX on Monday. <a href="https://x.com/WuBlockchain/status/1769926754121232554?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Reports</a> from blockchain media, Wu Blockchain, revealed that Bitcoin fell to around $8,900, following a massive BTC sell-off on the platform.</p>

<p>Wu Blockchain reported that a user sold over 400 BTC, which led to the price of Bitcoin falling to the aforementioned figure. Over the space of two hours, the unidentified user sold the 400 BTC in groups of 10–50 BTC.</p>
<p>Consequently, BitMEX&#8217;s market stability was impacted since the user sold the assets for incredibly low prices. However, according to reports from Blockchain Daily, the event was short-lived as prices have now returned to the normal level.</p>
<p>In response to the development, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitmex-co-founder-bitcoin-forecast-btc-to-reach-1-million-amid-banking-turmoil/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">BitMEX</a> has assured the crypto community that it is &#8220;looking into odd behavior&#8221; involving users selling substantial orders on the spot market for BTC-USDT.</p>
<p>The crypto platform further stated that while the investigation is ongoing, &#8220;the derivatives market will still be operational, including the index price for its popular XBT derivatives contracts.&#8221; Furthermore, the exchange confirmed the safety of users&#8217; funds and assets, and the platform is &#8220;running as usual.&#8221;</p>
<p>Given that the price of Bitcoin was situated at $68,000 before the incident, the drop indicates an over 87% decline. After falling to $8,900, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-whales-btc-exchanges/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin</a> recovered, but the abnormal price fluctuations lasted for an additional 30 minutes before things returned completely to normal.</p>
<p>The development has since stirred quite a frenzy within the cryptocurrency landscape, leaving the community to ponder on the reason behind the drop. Several crypto enthusiasts believe that the incident was a move orchestrated by BitMEX to manipulate prices to liquidate investors and end up making a lot of money.</p>
<h2>Larger Crash Might Take Place</h2>
<p>As Bitcoin continues to move downward, Gold advocate and crypto critic Peter Schiff has <a href="https://x.com/PeterSchiff/status/1769907447420817520?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">forecasted</a> a larger crash for prices. At first, Peter Schiff drew the crypto community&#8217;s attention to the 2021 rally, in which BTC peaked at $69,000.</p>

<p>However, the largest cryptocurrency witnessed a collapse the next year, and by November 2022, it was already trading at $16,000. As a result, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/peter-schiff-spot-bitcoin-etfs/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Schiff</a> mocked Bitcoin enthusiasts, asking, &#8220;How many of them still have their laser eyes on their profiles.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus, considering that the majority are presently more optimistic about BTC, Schiff anticipates a &#8220;bigger crash&#8221; is probably on the horizon. </p>
<p>As of the time of writing, the price of Bitcoin was trading at $62,943, indicating an over 7% decline in the past 24 hours. Its market cap is down more than 7%, while its trading volume holds steady increasing by 63% in the past day.</p>

<title>FOMC Preview: Bitcoin and Crypto’s Fate Tied To Fed Rate Move</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/fomc-preview-bitcoin-crypto-fed-rate-move/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章讨论了即将召开的联邦公开市场委员会（FOMC）会议对比特币和加密货币市场的影响。文章提到了比特币和以太坊在会议前期经历了严重的下跌，与美国经济指标和通胀数据有关。文章还提到了市场对FOMC利率和未来政策方向的预期，以及各种分析师对比特币和加密货币市场如何应对的看法。高盛预测了今年只会有3次降息。总之，市场正在谨慎地等待FOMC会议结果，并密切关注未来货币政策方向。 <div>
<p>In the lead-up to the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting scheduled for Wednesday, March 20, the Bitcoin and crypto market is experiencing a severe downtrend. BTC price has plunged roughly -10% in the past two days, and Ethereum (ETH) is down -12% in the same period.</p>
<p>The anticipation surrounding the Fed&#8217;s stance on interest rates has heightened in the wake of recent economic indicators, including unexpected <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/inflationary-concerns-rise-as-us-cpi-exceeds-predictions-bitcoin-price-reacts/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">spikes in the  US Consumer Price Index</a> (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI), stirring volatility across markets, including digital assets.</p>
<p>The consensus, with a 99% probability according to the CME FedWatch tool, suggests interest rates will hold steady. Nonetheless, the spotlight turns to the Fed&#8217;s dot plot, a graphical representation of the individual members&#8217; expectations for future interest rates, which could provide crucial insights into the monetary policy outlook for the coming months and years.</p>

<p>Anna Wong, Chief US Economist for Bloomberg, remarked via X (formerly Twitter), “Another reason why FOMC [is] not ready to cut: members not yet of broad agreement of that need. Here’s visualizing the dispersion of FOMC views with the help of our new weekly NLP Fed spectrometer. “</p>

<p></p>
<h2>How Will Bitcoin And Crypto React?</h2>
<p>Macro analyst Ted, expressing his perspective on X, underscores the nuanced relationship between macroeconomic trends and the crypto market at the moment. Ted elucidated that spot <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-etfs-see-record-1-billion-inflows/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin ETF flows</a> have taken the backseat while macro factors came to the foreground.</p>
<p>He <a href="https://twitter.com/tedtalksmacro/status/1769901194435338460" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">stated</a> via X, “If BTC is to be considered digital gold, it&#8217;s expected to mirror gold&#8217;s market movements, albeit with a higher degree of volatility. In the current climate, with the market bracing for the Fed&#8217;s upcoming meeting, macroeconomic factors momentarily take precedence, driven by recent developments in PPI and CPI figures.&#8221;</p>
<p>He further speculates that &#8220;Despite the eventual remarks from [Fed Chair] Powell, the market has already adopted a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/breaking-news-ticker/powell-speaks-at-jackson-hole-bitcoin-volatility-comes-back-with-a-vengeance/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">hawkish stance</a> in anticipation of a &#8216;higher for longer&#8217; interest rate scenario.&#8221;</p>

<p>Michaël van de Poppe, a noted figure in the crypto analysis domain, <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1769996367521353898" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">provided</a> his insights on the recent downward price movement of Bitcoin via X, citing a mix of factors including the anticipation of the FOMC meeting and significant capital outflows from <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/ethereum-news/grayscale-submits-revised-application-for-ethereum-spot-etf-whats-new/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Grayscale</a>&#8216;s Bitcoin Trust. Van de Poppe advises, &#8220;It&#8217;s typically in these pre-FOMC periods, perceived as risk-off intervals, that the savvy investor finds opportunities to &#8216;buy the dip&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a reflection of market sentiment adjustments, analyst @10delta on X<a href="https://twitter.com/_10delta_/status/1770036918991913188" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> pointed out</a> the strategic positioning of investors in anticipation of the Fed&#8217;s rate decisions. &#8220;The market is currently pricing in a reversal to the November &#8217;23 interest rate levels, a clear indication that investors are adjusting their expectations based on the Fed&#8217;s potential pivot signaled in the previous dot plot,&#8221; he noted.</p>
<p>Accordingly, he argues that the FOMC &amp; dot plot will be a &#8220;buy the news&#8221; event as the market expectations are being properly adjusted. &#8220;The macro worries [&#8230;] should dissipate &amp; crypto idiosyncratic bullish factors, such as the ETF inflows [&#8230;] as well as the BTC halving take hold. All considered I think there&#8217;s a good R/R for &#8216;buying the dip&#8217; heading into the March 20 event,&#8221; the analyst added.</p>
Goldman Sachs Predicts (Only) 3 Rate Cuts This Year
<p>Goldman Sachs Research recently provided a detailed analysis in their March FOMC Preview. The report highlights the nuanced balance the Fed seeks to achieve between controlling inflation and supporting economic growth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our revised forecast now anticipates three rate cuts in 2024, a slight adjustment from our previous prediction, primarily due to a modest uptick in the inflation trajectory,&#8221; Goldman Sachs analysts elucidated. They further speculate, &#8220;While the immediate focus is on maintaining current rate levels, the trajectory for rate cuts will hinge on inflation dynamics and economic performance indicators.&#8221;</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs further predicts that the Fed will still target a first cut in June. “This combined with a default pace of one cut per quarter implies that the most natural outcome for the median dot is to remain unchanged at 3 cuts or 4.625% for 2024,” the banking giant remarked.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Goldman: Inflation has been firmer in recent months, but we think it is still on track to fall enough by the June FOMC meeting for a first cut. <a href="https://t.co/0I1BPYiU8W" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/0I1BPYiU8W</a></p>

<p></p>
<p>As the crypto market and broader financial ecosystems await the outcomes of the FOMC meeting, the prevailing sentiment is one of cautious anticipation. Market participants are closely monitoring the Fed&#8217;s commentary for indications of future monetary policy directions via the dot plot.</p>
<p>The question for the Bitcoin and crypto market is whether there will be an unpleasant surprise or whether market participants were right with their &#8220;higher for longer&#8221; policy assumption.</p>
<p>At press time, BTC found support at the $62,400 price level, trading at $63,118.</p>

<title>Top Reasons Why The Bitcoin Price Crashed Below $63,000</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crashed-65000/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crashed-65000/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要: 这些信息是消极的。<br />比特币价格在过去24小时跌破了63,000美元，目前正处于价格修正阶段，最近创下73,750美元的历史新高。导致价格下跌的原因可能包括比特币减半即将到来。分析人士表示比特币正在进入减半趋势的第二阶段，长期持有者开始获利了，导致利润回吐。当前比特币情绪偏向熊市。 <div>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/why-bitcoin-halving-could-bring-uncertainty-to-mining-industry/" rel="nofollow">The flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin</a>, dropped below the $63,000 mark in the last 24 hours and is currently on a price correction, having recently hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $73,750. This price dip is believed to be due to several factors, including the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bull-market-glassnode/" rel="nofollow">Bitcoin Halving</a>, which is fast approaching. </p>
<h2>Bitcoin Price Is In The Second Phase Of The Halving Trend</h2>
<p>Crypto trader and analyst Rekt Capital <a href="https://x.com/rektcapital/status/1769656725341163692?s=20" rel="nofollow">recently provided</a> insights into the four phases of Bitcoin Halving, which provides a plausible explanation for Bitcoin’s recent decline. He suggested that Bitcoin was entering into the ‘Final Pre-Halving Retrace,’ having just concluded with the ‘<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/history-backs-buying-bitcoin-dip-before-halving/" rel="nofollow">Pre-Halving Rally</a>.’</p>

<p>This ‘Final Pre-Halving Retrace’ is said to occur 28 to 14 days before the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/grayscale-next-bitcoin-halving-different/">Halving event</a>. However, it looks to have come earlier this time around (just like the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-59000-pre-halving-rally/">Pre-Halving Rally</a>), with the Halving still about 30 days away. Rekt Capital alluded to the Pre-Halving retrace in 2016 and 2020 when Bitcoin pulled back by 38% and 20%, respectively. </p>
<p>Bitcoin has already pulled back over 11% in the past week. Interestingly, the analyst noted that this phase of the Halving can last “multiple weeks and up to 77 days.” Rekt Capital, however, expects it to be much shorter than <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/historical-bull-run-pattern-finally-forming-bitcoin/" rel="nofollow">historical ones</a>. He added that this year’s Pre-Halving Retrace “would more likely be on the shallower side than on the deeper side.”</p>
<h2>Long-Term Bitcoin Holders Are Taking Profit</h2>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/pro-xrp-lawyer-threat-crypto/" rel="nofollow">Alex Thorn</a>, Head of Research at Galaxy Digital, highlighted in an X (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/intangiblecoins/status/1769823573370150919?s=20" rel="nofollow">post</a> that long-term Bitcoin holders are starting to sell. This is evidenced by different metrics, such as the movement in coins that had stagnated for over a year. </p>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/analyst-predicts-when-dogecoin-will-reach-1/" rel="nofollow">Crypto analyst Ali Martinez</a> previously alluded to this wave of profit-taking, noting data from market intelligence platform Glassnode, which showed that those holding over 1,000 BTC were increasingly cashing out. This has also led to a 4.83% drop in this category of BTC addresses this past few weeks. </p>
<p>Thorn, however, sounded optimistic about Bitcoin’s future trajectory in his post, noting that new whales are entering (through the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-spot-etf-100-volume/" rel="nofollow">Spot Bitcoin ETF</a> market) as some others are exiting. He also suggested that some of these whales aren’t exactly leaving the market but selling their spot BTC and investing in Bitcoin ETFs instead. </p>
Bitcoin Sentiment Is Currently Bearish
<p><a href="https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData" rel="nofollow">Data</a> from Coinglass shows that the bears currently have the upper hand, with almost $82 million in <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-volatility-causes-over-300-million-in-liquidations-as-milei-moneda-is-set-to-generate-riches-for-investors/" rel="nofollow">long positions liquidated</a> in the last 24 hours compared to just about $23 million of shorts liquidated during the same period. </p>

<p>There has also been a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-open-interest-alarming-levels-brace-impact/" rel="nofollow">decrease in open interest</a> on these exchanges, which suggests that traders are choosing to stay out of the market at the moment. Therefore, activity in the derivatives market shows that the current outlook for Bitcoin is bearish, with many still expecting further declines. </p>
<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $63,000, down over 4% in the last 24 hours according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/" rel="nofollow">data</a> from CoinMarketCap. </p>

<title>Shiba Inu Ecosystem Blooms: BONE Jumps 44% With $3 Target In Sight</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />ShibaSwap的BONE代币在市场熊市中表现出色，备受关注。SHIB骑士预测其价格可能达到3美元，目前价格上涨并处于强劲的趋势中。BONE代币在过去30天内有了惊人的涨幅，目前价格为0.84美元，预计将突破3美元。为了提高BONE的市场可见性，Shiba Inu社区成员正在努力争取其在主要交易平台上的上市，这可能会为其带来大幅上涨的催化作用。 <div>
<p>Bone ShibaSwap (BONE), a token within the Shiba Inu ecosystem, has showcased remarkable resilience amidst a predominantly bearish market. Despite the downward trend, BONE has emerged as a top performer, catching the attention of community analyst SHIB Knight, who predicts further gains and a potential price target of $3.</p>

<p>SHIB Knight, a respected analyst within the Shiba Inu community, has been closely monitoring <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bone-shibaswap" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">BONE&#8217;s performance</a> and recently shared an update on the token&#8217;s outlook. Despite a previous failed breakout attempt, SHIB Knight remains optimistic, highlighting a chart that suggests BONE is now better positioned for an anticipated bullish breakout.</p>

<p>— $SHIB KNIGHT (@army_shiba) <a href="https://twitter.com/army_shiba/status/1769693757870379212?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">March 18, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>At the time of writing, BONE has experienced an impressive surge, with its price skyrocketing from a low of $0.87 to a high of $1.09. This surge represents a significant 44% gain in the monthly timeframe, accompanied by a substantial 60% increase in trading volume compared to the previous day.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-598641" height="389" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_a3a20d.png?resize=633%2C389" width="633" /></p>

<p>A Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 65 indicates that the Shiba Inu BONE Token is in a bullish trend and is seeing increased trading volumes after a spectacular 30-day rally. BONE is currently trading at $0.84.</p>
<p>While BONE&#8217;s current price hovers around $1.09, SHIB Knight has set a target price of $3, anticipating a potential 150% rally for the token. It is worth noting that the memecoin is currently down almost 98% from its all-time high in 2021, which implies ample room for growth.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/tjAjx8iK/" width="2475" /></p>

<p>The limited exposure of BONE among major centralized crypto trading platforms may have contributed to its slower price gains compared to the ecosystem&#8217;s leading token, SHIB. Currently, BONE is listed on platforms such as OKX and Gate.io, while notable exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, KuCoin, and Bybit have yet to support its trading.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I expected <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BONE&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">$BONE</a> to breakout of the channel, but it failed last time.</p>
<p>Breakout will happen sooner or later. Target is around $3 <a href="https://t.co/YJRRyST8kE" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/YJRRyST8kE</a></p>
<p>— $SHIB KNIGHT (@army_shiba) <a href="https://twitter.com/army_shiba/status/1769428146577682449?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">March 17, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>To address this limitation, leaders of the Shiba Inu community have rallied their members to campaign for BONE&#8217;s listing on Binance, one of the largest crypto exchanges. They firmly believe that inclusion on such a prominent platform would provide the necessary catalyst for explosive price rallies, potentially propelling BONE to unprecedented levels.</p>

<p>As demand for the Shiba Inu BONE Token rises and community members work strategically to achieve its listing and increase its market visibility, this positive momentum has raised investor intrigue about the token&#8217;s ability to cross the $3 threshold before the end of March.</p>
<p>Despite the inherent risks, the recent price surge of BONE and the optimistic outlook from SHIB Knight have generated excitement within the Shiba Inu community. Traders and enthusiasts will be closely monitoring BONE&#8217;s performance in the coming days, eagerly awaiting signs of a breakout and the potential for significant gains.</p>

<title>Japan’s $1.5 Trillion Pension Fund To Assess Bitcoin For Diversification</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/japans-1-5-trillion-pension-fund-assess-bitcoin/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/japans-1-5-trillion-pension-fund-assess-bitcoin/</guid>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。日本政府养老金投资基金(GPIF)正式宣布探索包括比特币在内的资产多元化机会，这标志着该基金传统上与更保守资产类别相关联的投资策略可能发生重大转变。GPIF目前处于信息请求阶段，将研究比特币和其他非传统资产的益处和风险。此举反映了该基金致力于拓宽其投资视野的努力。此外，日本日益推动比特币和加密货币投资的相关法规变化，使得投资基金能够直接持有比特币等加密货币。如果世界上最大的养老基金将比特币纳入其投资组合，这可能对其他国家和其投资战略产生重大影响。BTC目前交易价为$64,589。 <div>
<p>The Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF) of Japan, the world’s largest pension fund with assets totaling $1.5 trillion, has officially announced its initiative to explore diversification opportunities that include Bitcoin, alongside traditional investments such as gold and more unconventional assets like forests and farmland. This exploration marks a monumental potential pivot in the investment strategy of a fund traditionally associated with more conservative asset classes.</p>
<h2>Japan GPIF Seeks Information On Bitcoin</h2>
<p>According to a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.co.jp/news/articles/2024-03-19/SAKP1VT0AFB400" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">report</a> dated March 19, 2024, GPIF is in the initial phase of this exploration, focusing on an information request stage rather than signaling an imminent expansion of its investment portfolio. The fund currently diversifies its holdings across a vast array of assets, including domestic and international stocks and bonds, infrastructure, and real estate. With assets under management valued at approximately 225 trillion yen as of the end of December 2023, the GPIF&#8217;s interest in Bitcoin and other illiquid assets underscores a notable shift towards broadening its investment aperture.</p>

<p>The GPIF stated, &#8220;In addition to basic knowledge about the assets targeted for information provision, we are also seeking information on how overseas pension funds incorporate them into their portfolios and actual investment cases.&#8221; This reflects a methodical approach to understanding the potential benefits and risks associated with diversifying into less traditional and more volatile asset classes like Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Recent years have seen the GPIF actively seeking to enhance the sophistication and diversity of its portfolio. &#8220;Since the fall of 2022, a total of 56 active funds have been selected in North American, developed country, and Japanese stocks,&#8221; the GPIF noted, highlighting its ongoing efforts to refine its investment strategies. The inclusion of Bitcoin and other non-traditional assets would represent a further step in these <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/trading-bitcoin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">diversification</a> efforts.</p>
<p>However, the GPIF has cautiously noted, &#8220;This announcement is a request for information and does not indicate that the company will expand its investment targets in the future.&#8221; This statement clarifies that any decision to incorporate Bitcoin or other proposed assets into its investment strategy will depend on the outcomes of its current research phase.</p>

<p>This move by the GPIF comes amid broader regulatory changes in Japan regarding Bitcoin and crypto investments. Just one month prior to this announcement, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/japanese-government-to-ease-30-crypto-tax-requirement-a-good-move/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Japan&#8217;s administration</a>, led by Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, moved to enable investment funds to hold Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies directly. &#8220;The bill states that &#8216;measures will be taken to add crypto assets to the list of assets that can be acquired and held by investment limited partnerships,'&#8221; according to a statement from the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry.</p>
<p>The GPIF&#8217;s exploration of Bitcoin and alternative assets not only underscores the growing <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-etfs-see-record-1-billion-inflows/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">institutional interest</a> in Bitcoin, but is also in line with Japan&#8217;s regulatory advances aimed at integrating digital assets into the country&#8217;s economic framework. The potential inclusion of Bitcoin in the world&#8217;s largest pension fund would be huge news and could have implications for other countries and their investment strategies.</p>
<p>At press time, BTC traded at $64,589.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。XRP价格从$0.7450阻力开始下跌，难以保持在$0.5850支撑区域以上。价格在$0.650以下交易，并且已经跌破了100四小时简单移动平均线。有一个关键的下行趋势线形成，阻力位于$0.640。如果价格能在$0.6650阻力区域收盘，可能会开始新的上涨。如果下跌，支撑位于$0.5980和$0.5850，更下方支撑位于$0.5200。技术指标显示MACD和RSI都偏于熊市。 <div>
<p><em>XRP price started a downside correction from the $0.7450 resistance. The bulls are now struggling to keep the price above the $0.5850 support zone.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>XRP started a fresh decline after it failed to clear the $0.7450 resistance.</li>
<li>The price is now trading below $0.650 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.640 on the 4-hour chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken).</li>
<li>The pair could start a fresh rally if there is a close above the $0.6650 resistance zone.</li>
</ul>
<h2>XRP Price Trims Gains</h2>
<p>After a steady increase, XRP price struggled to extend gains above the $0.750 resistance. The price started a downside correction from the $0.7442 high, like <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-extends-losses-3200/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ethereum</a> and <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-at-risk-65k/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin</a>.</p>
<p>There was a steady decline below the $0.700 and $0.665 support levels. The price even declined below the $0.600 support. A low was formed near $0.5874 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor increase above the $0.620 level.</p>
<p>The price spiked above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.7442 swing high to the $0.5874 low. However, the bears were active near $0.650. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.640 on the 4-hour chart of the XRP/USD pair.</p>
<p>Ripple’s token price is now trading below $0.620 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $0.640 zone. The first key resistance is near $0.6650 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.7442 swing high to the $0.5874 low, above which the price could rise toward the $0.70 resistance.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/XRP_Price_d9d9a4.png?resize=1024%2C461"><img alt="XRP Price Prediction" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-598594" height="461" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/XRP_Price_d9d9a4.png?resize=1024%2C461" width="1024" /></a></p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XRPUSD/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">XRPUSD on TradingView.com</a></p>
<p>A close above the $0.70 resistance zone could spark a strong increase. The next key resistance is near $0.7450. If the bulls remain in action above the $0.7450 resistance level, there could be a rally toward the $0.800 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.820 resistance.</p>
<h2>More Losses?</h2>
<p>If XRP fails to clear the $0.6650 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5980 zone.</p>
<p>The next major support is at $0.5850. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.5850 level, the price might accelerate lower. In the stated case, the price could retest the $0.520 support zone.</p>
<p>Technical Indicators</p>
<p>4-Hours MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone.</p>
<p>4-Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level.</p>

<title>PlanB’s Bitcoin Forecast: A Journey To $5 Million Per BTC In The Next Decade</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/planbs-bitcoin-forecast-a-journey-to-5-million/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/planbs-bitcoin-forecast-a-journey-to-5-million/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要: 这些信息是积极的。PlanB提出了关于比特币未来发展的预测，引起了加密社区的兴趣和讨论。根据S2F模型，2020-2024的减半周期预计将使比特币价格稳定在约5万美元左右。2024-2028周期将为比特币升至50万美元奠定基础，最终在2028-2032周期达到500万美元。虽然这些预测引起了争议，但PlanB指出，S2F模型虽然能指导总体趋势，但精确的未来价格预测存在较大误差。此外，文章还提到了比特币最新价格走势，显示了市场的技术分析和价格变动。 <div>
<p>PlanB, a popular name within the Bitcoin community, thanks to his Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model, has <a href="https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD/status/1769681310296035783?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">shared</a> the latest discourse on X, igniting a flurry of excitement and speculation. This discourse particularly highlights BTC&#8217;s potential journey through successive <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-sentiment-cools-price-rebound-soon/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">halving cycles</a>.</p>
<p>PlanB&#8217;s analysis, deeply rooted in the S2F model, presents a narrative for Bitcoin&#8217;s future. This model scrutinizes the correlation between an asset&#8217;s existing reserves (stock) and annual production (flow) and lays the groundwork for <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/planbs-market-cycle-analysis-bitcoin-gears-up-for-skyrocketing-beyond-100000/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">PlanB’s bold predictions</a>.</p>

<h2>Navigating Through Predictions: A Community Aweigh</h2>
<p>According to the model, the forthcoming halving cycle spanning 2020-2024 is expected to solidify Bitcoin&#8217;s price at around $50,000. But the real spectacle unfolds in the ensuing cycles, with<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-hits-support-65k/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> projections</a> setting the stage for Bitcoin to ascend to $500,000 in the 2024-2028 cycle, eventually reaching a monumental $5 million in the 2028-2032 cycle.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Stock-to-Flow 2020-2024 halving cycle: ~$50k
Stock-to-Flow 2024-2028 halving cycle: ~$500k
Stock-to-Flow 2028-2032 halving cycle: ~$5m
Yes, S2F = exponential growth, and it will continue IMO. <a href="https://t.co/rH1KmIyKSl" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/rH1KmIyKSl</a></p>
<p>— PlanB (@100trillionUSD) <a href="https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD/status/1769681310296035783?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">March 18, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The predictions made by PlanB have sparked interest and debate among the crypto community. Many are curious to see if Bitcoin will experience the forecasted substantial growth.</p>
<p>An X user responded to PlanB&#8217;s post, expressing hopefulness yet advising caution due to the limited number of data points that can&#8217;t definitively predict precise future prices, like an average of $500k from 2024 to 2028.</p>
<p>PlanB acknowledged this caution, pointing out that his predictions are based on three past halving events and the significant pre-halving period, suggesting that while the Stock-to-Flow model can guide the general trend, its accuracy comes with a considerable margin of error.</p>
<p>For instance, while the 2020-2024 period was projected to see an average of $55k, the actual figure was around $33k.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Very true. Only 3 halvings (2012, 2016 and 2020) plus the crucial pre-halving period (where BTC S2F grew from below 1 to ~4). And S2F is only for general direction, of course, and with wide error margin (for example: prediction 2020-2024 was 55k but in reality ~33k).</p>
<p>— PlanB (@100trillionUSD) <a href="https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD/status/1769684174137405648?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">March 18, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Additionally, another user in the conversation, known as Phoenix of Crypto, <a href="https://x.com/PhoenixBTC7/status/1769688309456912892?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">remarked</a> that while PlanB&#8217;s projection might seem &#8220;overly optimistic,&#8221; the true outcome remains to be seen, emphasizing the need for patience.</p>
<p>This user highlighted the uncertainty surrounding <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/planbs-triple-bitcoin-forecast-a-pre-halving-surge/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin&#8217;s future</a>, especially considering the potential impacts of ETFs and widespread adoption, signaling an open-minded but watchful approach to market developments.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Latest Price Action</h2>
<p>Bitcoin is undergoing a notable decline, having decreased by 7.5% over the last week. This downward trajectory has extended into the last 24 hours, with the cryptocurrency dropping an additional 1.5%. Despite these setbacks, Bitcoin&#8217;s trading price remains at $67,167 at the time of writing.</p>

<p>This range is seen as a possible pivot point for the market&#8217;s direction, concurrently noting the substantial selling activity on leading platforms such as Coinbase and Binance.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin Price Faces Resistance</h2>
<p>Bitcoin price attempted a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-hits-support-65k/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">fresh increase</a> above the $65,500 zone. BTC climbed above the $67,200 and $68,000 levels. However, the bears were active near the $69,000 zone.</p>
<p>A high was formed at $68,898 and the price is now moving lower. There was a move below the $67,500 support zone. The price declined below the 50% Fib retracement level of the recovery wave from the $64,555 swing low to the $68,898 high.</p>

<p>There is also a connecting bearish trend line forming with resistance at $67,800 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Immediate resistance is near the $66,750 level.

<div> <br /><br />摘要: 这些信息是积极的。文章介绍了Ether.fi的治理代币ETHFI的空投活动，吸引了约20000名参与者。虽然ETHFI的价值在空投后出现了35%的下跌，但分配策略旨在确保更广泛和更公平地分发代币。此外，Ether.fi的净存款和总锁定价值都呈现出显著增长，但活跃用户数量有所波动。总体而言，ETHFI代币的空投吸引了很多关注，而Ether.Fi生态系统中ETHFI的长期潜力和影响尚待充分实现。 <div>
<p>ETHFI, the governance token of the decentralized liquid staking protocol Ether.fi, debuted for $4.13 following its distribution through its <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-open-interest-40-crash/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">airdrop </a>on March 18. </p>
<p>However, since the $210 million airdrop, the value of ETHFI has experienced a significant decline, plummeting over 35% to its current trading price of $3.05, according to CoinGecko <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ether-fi" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">data</a>.</p>
<h2>ETHFI Airdrop Attracts 20,000 Participants</h2>
<p>Market expert Tom Wan has provided a <a href="https://x.com/tomwanhh/status/1769706615744118948?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">summary </a>of the ETHFI airdrop. Out of the total supply of 16.8 million ETHFI tokens, approximately 28% have been claimed by participants. </p>

<p>The airdrop attracted around 20,000 claimers, showcasing considerable interest in the token distribution. Notably, the top wallets, accounting for 1.67% of the total distribution, have the potential to receive between 10,000 and 25,000 <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-price-soars-10-in-reaction-to-explosive-2367-shib-burn-surge/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">ETHFI tokens</a>, reflecting substantial holdings.</p>
<img alt="Ether.fi " class="wp-image-598577 size-large" height="469" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot_80.jpg?w=860&#038;resize=860%2C469" width="860" />
<p>Most claimers, comprising approximately 67% of participants, are expected to receive a lower allocation of ETHFI tokens, ranging from 175 to 500. </p>
<p>This distribution strategy aims to ensure a broader and more equitable dispersion of the tokens among participants. However, an interesting observation is that 76% of claimers have transferred their ETHFI tokens to other wallets, indicating a potential desire for liquidity or <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-sentiment-cools-price-rebound-soon/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">trading activities</a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is noteworthy that 38% of the token receivers are new wallets, suggesting an expansion of the ETHFI user base as of May 1, 2023. This influx of new participants showcases a growing interest in the governance and utility offered by Ether.Fi&#8217;s protocol.</p>
<h2>Ether.fi Witnesses Surge In Total Value Locked</h2>
<p>Ether.fi has experienced notable growth in net deposits and Total Value Locked (TVL), as evidenced by <a href="https://tokenterminal.com/terminal/projects/etherfi" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">data </a>provided by Token Terminal. However, the platform has faced fluctuations in its active user base. </p>
<p>According to Token Terminal, net deposits on Ether.fi have significantly increased, reaching $2.99 billion over the past 30 days alone. This marks a significant growth rate of 136.9%.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the TVL on Ether.fi has mirrored the surge in <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-approaches-risky-territory-as-halving-event-draws-near/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">net deposits</a>, which also amount to $2.99 billion over the same 30-day period. This metric represents the total value of assets, predominantly cryptocurrency, locked within the protocol. </p>
<p>However, while Ether.fi has witnessed robust growth in net deposits and TVL, the platform has experienced fluctuations in its active user base. Daily active users have shown a considerable decline of 54.3% over the past 30 days, currently standing at 506. </p>
<img alt="Ether.fi " class="wp-image-598578 size-large" height="418" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot_81.jpg?w=579&#038;resize=579%2C418" width="579" />
<p>Similarly, weekly active users have experienced a more moderate decline of 3.5%, currently standing at 5,780. This suggests that while there has been a slight reduction in user engagement every week, a significant portion of the user base remains actively involved with the protocol.</p>
<p>The most substantial decline in user activity is observed in monthly active users, with a notable drop of 68.9% over the past 30 days. The figure currently stands at 14,740 users. </p>

<p>Overall, the distribution of the ETHFI token through the airdrop has garnered significant attention and participation. At the same time, the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-threatens-to-retreat-to-60000-as-bulls-seek-solid-ground/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">token&#8217;s value</a> has experienced a decline since its initial listing, the long-term potential and impact of ETHFI within the Ether.Fi ecosystems are yet to be fully realized.</p>

<title>Is Ripple Behind The XRP Price Crash? Massive Selling Spree Sparks Concern</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/ripple-behind-xrp-price-crash/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/ripple-behind-xrp-price-crash/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的<br />文章讨论了Ripple最近转移240万XRP代币到一个未知地址的行为，引发了人们对XRP价格崩溃的担忧。进行的两次交易分别发生在3月5日和3月13日，而XRP价格在3月11日曾经上涨至0.74美元后出现急剧下跌。尽管有人认为Ripple的销售行为可能导致了价格下降，但也有人表示疑问。目前XRP价格持续下跌，市场对于这一情况的讨论仍在继续。 <div>
<p>Ripple’s occasional sale of XRP tokens has always been pinpointed as one reason for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-price-action-legal-expert/" rel="nofollow">XRP’s tepid price action</a>. Once again, the crypto firm’s recent offloading of a significant amount of XRP has raised concerns <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-will-remain-flat-even-if-bitcoin-roars/" rel="nofollow">about its negative effect</a> on the crypto token. </p>
<h2>Ripple Offloads 240 Million XRP</h2>
<p><a href="https://xrpscan.com/account/rBg2FuZT91C52Nny68houguJ4vt5x1o91m" rel="nofollow">On-chain data</a> shows that Ripple transferred a total of 240 million XRP tokens to an unknown address in two separate transactions. The first transaction occurred on March 5, when it sent 100 million XRP to the address in question. Then, on March 13, the Ripple wallet again transferred 140 million XRP to this address. </p>

<p>These transactions have raised eyebrows, and members of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-cto-burn-xrp-holdings/" rel="nofollow">XRP community</a> are contemplating whether these sales might have been the reason XRP’s price crashed recently. Notably, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-is-primed-for-growth/">the crypto token rose</a> to as high as $0.74 on March 11 before seeing a sharp correction. </p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-price-to-hit-3-4-crypto-expert-reveals-when/" rel="nofollow">XRP’s price</a> crashed on March 5, the day the first transaction was carried out. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that the crypto token, which was trading as high as $0.65 on the day, dropped to as low as $0.55 on the same day. However, it remains uncertain whether or not Ripple’s action was directly responsible for this price dip.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/39000-xrp-price-to-hit-220/" rel="nofollow">XRP’s price</a> was pretty stable on the day the second transaction occurred, although it was still declining from its weekly high of $0.7, recorded on March 11. The impact of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/ripple-xrp-sales-jump-in-2023/">Ripple’s XRP sales</a> on the market continues to be heavily debated among those in the<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrps-underperformance-ruffles-feathers-as-community-asks-ripple-to-do-something-about-price/" rel="nofollow"> XRP community</a>. </p>
<p>Pro-XRP crypto YouTuber Jerry Hall <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-expert-xrp-price-suppressed/" rel="nofollow">previously claimed</a> that Ripple was suppressing XRP’s price with its monthly sales. However, there has also been a <a href="https://blockworks.co/news/ripple-xrp-sec-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">report</a> that Ripple’s sale doesn’t impact prices on crypto exchanges. </p>
<h2>If Not Ripple, Then Who?</h2>
<p>Ripple’s price action defies logic, especially considering that the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-ceo-success-for-xrp/" rel="nofollow">token’s fundamentals </a>and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/parabolic-breakout-xrp-price/" rel="nofollow">technical analysis</a> suggest it is well primed for a parabolic move. That is why talks about possible market manipulation continue to persist. It is also understandable that all fingers instantly point to Ripple since they are the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/top-10-xrp-wallets-11-supply/" rel="nofollow">largest XRP holders</a>. </p>

<p>However, if Ripple is indeed not responsible for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-will-remain-flat-even-if-bitcoin-roars/" rel="nofollow">XRP’s stagnant price action</a>, then there needs to be another explanation for why XRP has continued to underperform. Although the crypto token has continued to rank in the top 10 largest crypto tokens by market cap, it is worth mentioning that it is one of few tokens that has a negative year-to-date (YTD) gain. </p>
<p>At the time of writing, XRP is trading at around $0.61, up in the last 24 hours according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xrp/" rel="nofollow">data</a> from CoinMarketCap. </p>

<title>Bitcoin Has Undergone This Bearish Structure Change, Analyst Explains</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。最近比特币的Coinbase溢价差持续为负值，表明大型美国实体正在出售比特币。这反映在比特币价格下跌近9％至约67300美元。分析显示，美国机构交易商今年推动了价格行动，当前的熊市结构可能使价格无法积累太多上行动力。愿景不明朗。 <div>
<p>An analyst has explained that the recent trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap suggests a significant change in the asset&#8217;s structure.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap Has Continued To Be Negative</h2>
<p>In a new <a href="https://twitter.com/JA_Maartun/status/1769722321609101793" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, analyst Maartunn discussed how the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap is still negative. The &#8220;Coinbase Premium Gap&#8221; here refers to a metric that tracks the difference between the Bitcoin prices listed on cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase (USD pair) and Binance (USDT pair).</p>

<p>This indicator&#8217;s value provides hints about how the behavior of the former&#8217;s userbase currently differs from that of the latter platform.</p>
<p>Below is the chart shared by the analyst that reveals the trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap since the start of the year.</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="2580" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GI9REFQXAAA9MLp?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096" width="4096" /></p>

<p>As the graph shows, the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap had been mostly positive as Bitcoin had gone through its journey from $44,000 to beyond the $73,000 level.</p>
<p>This would imply that the price listed on the exchange was higher than on Binance during this period. Such a trend naturally suggests that the buying pressure on the former was greater than on the latter.</p>
<p>Coinbase is widely known to be the preferred platform of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/institutionals-bitcoin-fomo-coinbase-premium/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">US-based institutional investors</a>, while Binance has global traffic. Thus, the green positive premium values would imply these large American entities had been buying and supporting the rally.</p>
<p>Recently, however, the indicator&#8217;s value turned negative as these investors took to selling instead. Since then, the metric has continued to assume such values. Alongside this selloff, the BTC price has experienced a notable decline.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap followed a similar pattern during the first month or so of the year. In the first 10 days of January, the metric had been positive as buying had occurred in anticipation of the<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-etfs-see-record-1-billion-inflows/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs)</a>. Still, after the ETFs had been approved, the indicator had turned negative.</p>

<p>The red premium values had maintained for a few weeks, during which the cryptocurrency price had struggled. Based on this pattern and the recent trend, it would seem that American institutional traders have driven the price action this year.</p>
<p>As such, so long as the current bearish structure in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap exists, it&#8217;s possible that the price may not be able to amass too much upward momentum.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>At the end of the positive Coinbase Premium Gap streak, Bitcoin had been able to achieve a new all-time high above $73,800, but as traders have switched to selling on the platform, the coin has dropped almost 9%, with its price now trading around $67,300.</p>

<title>Profit-Taking Panic, Short-Term Bitcoin Holders Sell Off – What’s Next For BTC?</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/profit-taking-panic-short-term-bitcoin-holders/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。最近的区块链数据显示了一个重要趋势：持有比特币不到五个月的投资者正在大量获利。这种短期持有者为了获利而清仓的现象反映了先前牛市高峰时期的模式。此外，引入了BTC现货交易所交易基金（ETF）可能会平衡市场动态，缓解短期持有者获利行为的不良影响。预计RIAs市场的资金流入将带来积极需求冲击，增加比特币的投资。同时，BTC的供需动态显示出不断增长的需求对减少供应的压力。<br /> <div>
<p>Recent on-chain data <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptoquant_com/status/1769516442729533668?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">highlighted</a> a significant trend: a wave of profit-taking by investors who have held Bitcoin (BTC) for less than five months.</p>
<p>As detailed by CryptoQuant&#8217;s latest data, this phenomenon is not just a random market movement but an echo of patterns observed at the zeniths of previous bull markets.</p>

<h2>Profit-Taking Among Short-Term Bitcoin Holders Signals Market Shift</h2>
<p>According to CryptoQuant, the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), a key metric in evaluating the profit and loss of Bitcoin transactions over a specific period, showcases a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-sentiment-cools-price-rebound-soon/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">pronounced uptick</a> indicative of widespread profit realization.</p>
<p>This tendency among short-term holders to liquidate their holdings for gains parallels historical market peaks and suggests a critical juncture for Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Crypto Dan, a seasoned market analyst, emphasized the significance of this trend, stating, &#8220;This movement is something that only happens once every few years,&#8221; highlighting the uniqueness and possible consequences of the present market trends.</p>

<p>&#8220;In relation to this adjustment, if we look at the SOPR, there was a big movement related to profit realization by short-term holders who held <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BTC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#BTC</a> for less than 5 months.&#8221;

<h2>New Market Forces At Play: ETFs Inflow Set To Rebalance The Equation</h2>
<p>While the SOPR metric might signal alarm bells reminiscent of past <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-hits-support-65k/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">bull market peaks</a>, the crypto landscape is underpinned by factors that could mitigate the traditional outcomes of such profit-taking.</p>
<p>Among these is the recent introduction of a BTC spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). This new avenue for Bitcoin investment introduces a complex layer to the market&#8217;s dynamics, potentially cushioning any adverse effects of short-term holders&#8217; profit-taking activities.</p>
<p>Dan concluded by <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/65f6b4e4afc8f17fcb7e6924-BTC-short-term-investors-took-large-profits?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=sns&amp;utm_campaign=quicktake&amp;utm_content=crypto-dan" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">noting</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>But considering the BTC spot ETF and potential additional inflows from institutions and individuals, it is difficult to judge it as simply a signal of the peak of a bull market. After a short-term correction period, it&#8217;s very likely that we will see a strong further bull in 2024.</p></blockquote>
<p>CoinShares Head of Research, James Butterfill, <a href="https://blog.coinshares.com/the-bitcoin-demand-shock-5be12c1738b3" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">provides</a> a further layer of analysis, suggesting an imminent &#8220;positive demand shock&#8221; for Bitcoin. According to Butterfill, the delay in making spot Bitcoin ETFs accessible to the Registered Investment Advisors (RIA) market — a sector managing around $50 trillion in assets — is set to end.</p>
<p>With RIAs requiring three months of<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-threatens-to-retreat-to-60000-as-bulls-seek-solid-ground/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> trading data</a> before including new ETFs in their portfolios, the market is on the cusp of witnessing a substantial influx of new investments into Bitcoin. &#8220;If 10% of RIAs chose to invest 1% of their portfolios, this could result in approximately $50 billion in additional inflows,&#8221; Butterfill elaborated, highlighting the scale of potential market impact.</p>
<p>Moreover, the current supply-demand dynamics within the Bitcoin <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-approaches-risky-territory-as-halving-event-draws-near/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">market are skewed</a> towards increasing demand against decreasing supply.</p>

<p>The daily demand for BTC, fueled by the trade of spot BTC ETFs and the average production of new coins, underscores a growing discrepancy that ETF issuers are filling by <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-crashes-dip-to-65000-triggers-over-400-million-liquidation-avalanche/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">tapping into the secondary market</a>.</p>
<p>This scenario is evidenced by a dramatic decrease in OTC desk coin holdings, a direct consequence of ETF-driven demand, according to Butterfill.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Whales Enter Full Accumulation Mode: Here’s How Much BTC They Pulled From Exchanges</title>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章指出上周比特币价格波动，由于大量比特币从交易所撤出，大型投资者预计价格将进一步上涨。数据显示，过去一周已有21,401枚比特币从交易所转移。另外，13名新的持有超过1,000个比特币的大鲸鱼加入。此外，3月15日比特币从交易所取出的金额达到5.75亿美元，是自2023年5月以来的最高点。尽管市场信心略有下降，但通过大量比特币的撤离来看，大鲸鱼似乎在为持续的涨势做准备。 <div>
<p>The Bitcoin price movement last week revealed a series of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-crashes-dip-to-65000-triggers-over-400-million-liquidation-avalanche/">ups and downs</a>, from starting the week at a new all-time high of  $73,780 to crashing 12% in the days after to reach below $65,000. Crypto data analysts have spotted massive amounts of Bitcoin being withdrawn from major exchanges during the period of uncertainty, indicating that large investors anticipate further price appreciation. </p>
<p>According to a social media post by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, the total BTC balance on crypto exchanges fell by over 21,400 in the past week, with the creation of 13 new whales, each holding over 1,000 BTC.</p>
<h2>BTC Withdrawal From Exchanges</h2>
<p>Bitcoin crossed over $73,700 last week to register a new all-time high but has struggled to gain a footing above the price level. Interestingly, it would seem the new all-time high sparked a wave of profit-taking from some investors. However, on-chain and exchange data indicate Bitcoin is still undergoing a bullish sentiment from some investors, particularly large investors. </p>

<p>Crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted this bull accumulation pattern in a post on his social media platform X. According to a Glassnode chart shared by the analyst, the total amount of BTC on exchanges has been on a free-fall since the middle of January. Notably, the total BTC balance saw a brief increase in the first few days of March before resuming a free-fall on March 5. In the past week alone, 21,401 BTC were moved off crypto exchanges. </p>

<p>Similarly, the crypto analytics platform IntoTheBlock noted this outflow pattern during the week. According to ITB, BTC withdrawal from crypto exchanges reached its highest point this year on March 15. Interestingly, $750 million worth of Bitcoin was withdrawn on this day, the highest since May 2023.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

The majority of these withdrawals originate from Bitfinex ($524m) and Kraken ($130m) <a href="https://t.co/8d3eIJROhv" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/8d3eIJROhv</a></p>
<p>— IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) <a href="https://twitter.com/intotheblock/status/1768592828362289234?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">March 15, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<h2>What Does This Mean For Bitcoin?</h2>
<p>The Bitcoin ecosystem has witnessed serious money on the move since the beginning of the year, leading to a strong price surge for the cryptocurrency. However, this rally has since slowed down to spark a price correction, with market sentiment <a href="https://x.com/ali_charts/status/1769049306827272609?s=20" rel="nofollow">reaching the most negative sentiment</a> toward BTC since December 2023. Bitcoin is currently trading at $68,201, down by 3.44% in the past seven days. </p>

<p>After such a strong surge in price, it’s normal for the momentum to slow down as the market consolidates and decides on the next move. While momentum has slowed, the overall trend for <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-hits-support-65k/">Bitcoin remains bullish</a>. </p>
<p>Judging by the massive amounts of Bitcoin pulled from exchanges recently, it looks like whales are gearing up for a continued rally. <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-a-decades-long-investment-ceo-says-despite-recent-downturn/" rel="nofollow">Bitcoin is now showing signs</a> of a rally, and is now up by 5% in the past 24 hours. </p>

<title>Arbitrum Whales Are HODLing; Why Are ARB Prices Tanking?</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/arbitrum-whales-hodling-arb-prices-tanking/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />最近解锁的ARB触发了抛售担忧，但Lookonchain数据显示出不同的情况。仅有58百万ARB被11个大型投资者发送到交易所，显示出其他鲸鱼持有着他们的ARB，对项目的未来充满信心。尽管价格下跌，但持有者保持乐观，而Dencun升级对Arbitrum的发展也有利。 Arbitrum继续领先于第二层扩展解决方案，在总锁定价值方面胜过Optimism。 <div>
<p>While the recent unlocking of ARB triggered fears of a sell-off, Lookonchain data suggests a different story. On March 18, the analytics platform <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1769586523639562691" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">showed</a> that a mere 58 million ARB, representing only a tiny portion of the 1.1 billion tokens unlocked on March 16, were sent to exchanges by just 11 large-scale investors, commonly called &#8220;whales.&#8221;</p>
<img alt="ARB whales transferred coins to exchanges | Source: ARBUSDT on Binance, TradingView" class="size-full wp-image-598523" height="668" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GI7Vb57aAAA61XH.png?resize=1024%2C668" width="1024" />
<h2>Are Whales Bullish On ARB? </h2>
<p>This transfer indicates that despite some profit-taking, other whales are HODLing on to their ARB, reflecting continued confidence in the project&#8217;s future. </p>
<p>On March 16, Arbitrum <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://token.unlocks.app/arbitrum" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">sent</a> 1.1 billion ARB to investors, team members, and advisors in a &#8220;Cliff Unlock.&#8221; Analysts describe a &#8220;Cliff Unlock&#8221; as a situation in which all allocated tokens for that event are released simultaneously.</p>

<p>Arbitrum chose to release all tokens at once. 673.5 million were sent to advisors and the team. Meanwhile, the remainder, 438.25 million, was sent to investors. The unlocking event, as expected, was a source of concern that some receivers would choose to sell in the secondary market. </p>
<p>As expected, ARB prices have decreased, reflecting the general sentiment across the crypto market board. So far, ARB is down 24% from March 2024 highs. However, what&#8217;s clear is that the uptrend remains, and buyers remain in charge despite the selling pressure.</p>
<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/x/dsNW23i2/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="Arbitrum prices trending downward on the daily chart | Source: ARBUSDT on Binance, TradingView" class="size-full" height="904" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/dsNW23i2/" width="1787" /></a>
<p>Based purely on price action, ARB bulls have a chance if prices are above the $1.6 to $1.65 support zone. Conversely, any upswing above this level might drive prices to the upper end of the range at around $2.20. Further upswings will continue the sharp expansion from October 2023. At the time of writing, ARB is up 125% from Q4 2023 lows.</p>
<h2>Arbitrum To Benefit From Dencun, Cementing Its Layer-2 Dominance</h2>
<p>Lookonchain data shows that only a few tokens were sent to exchanges less than a week after the unlocking event, suggesting investors and whales are bullish about the project. </p>
<p>L2Beat data <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://l2beat.com/scaling/summary" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">shows</a> that Arbitrum, a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, is the largest in that category by total value locked (TVL). By March 18, Arbitrum managed $14.7 billion worth of assets, nearly 2X that of Optimism.</p>
<img alt="Arbitrum TVL | Source: L2Beat" class="size-full wp-image-598521" height="434" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot591.png?resize=893%2C434" width="893" />
<p>While ARB is under pressure, the broader Ethereum and crypto community remains bullish. Last week, the &#8220;Dencun&#8221; update was released to the mainnet. </p>

<p>This update is significant as it further slashes transaction fees, making layer-2s, including Arbitrum, more attractive for users. This upgrade is especially appealing to developers and users seeking to enjoy the high on-chain activity on Ethereum without struggling with high gas fees and low scalability. As Layer-2 solutions find adoption, Arbitrum could benefit from this influx.</p>

<title>Arbitrum Token Sell-Off: Whales Transfer $58M To Exchanges Following Unlock, ARB Price Reacts</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。Layer 2协议Arbitrum (ARB)解锁了11亿个令牌，导致其本地令牌价值下跌。11只大鲸鱼将价值5800万美元的ARB令牌存入交易所出售。Wintermute交易公司连续两天存入ARB令牌，可能用于出售。ARB令牌自其创下的2.39美元历史高点以来已经下跌了29%。解锁后，ARB的价格出现了3%的上涨，但循序渐进地下跌，21天后达到-21%的低点。然而，约在25天后，价格开始大幅恢复，超过解锁当天水平19%。过去的模式显示，虽然ARB可能面临解锁后的初期压力，但在接下来的几周内可能会出现恢复和积极的价格走势。 <div>
<p>On Saturday, March 16, the Layer 2 protocol Arbitrum (ARB) unlocked 1.1 billion <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/arbitrum/arbitrum-beats-ethereum-and-solana-with-119-surge-in-nft-sales-nft-resurgence-on-the-horizon/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">ARB tokens</a> as part of its 2024 roadmap. This event led to a significant decline in the native token&#8217;s value, with losses of up to 18% reported over the past week. </p>
<p>In the past 24 hours, more whales have been sending ARB tokens to exchanges for selling, indicating a potential further drop in the protocol&#8217;s prices. This token unlocking marks the beginning of a four-year phased process, releasing a specific number of tokens every four weeks until 2027.</p>
<h2>11 Whales Dump $58 Million Worth Of ARB Tokens</h2>
<p>Following the massive unlocking of ARB tokens, analysis firm Lookonchain <a href="https://x.com/lookonchain/status/1769586523639562691?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">revealed </a>that 11 whales deposited 34 million ARB tokens (equivalent to $58 million) into exchanges. </p>
<p>Additionally, on-chain data provider &#8220;The Data Nerd&#8221; <a href="https://x.com/OnchainDataNerd/status/1769381905244529099?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">noted </a>that trading firm Wintermute has been continuously depositing ARB tokens for the past 48 hours, potentially for selling purposes. </p>
<p>The data provider notes that digital asset trading firm Wintermute now holds only 7.22 million ARB tokens worth $12.35 million, indicating that they have already deposited or sold $18.12 million worth of ARB over the past few days.</p>

<p>The ARB token has been on a 29% downtrend since reaching its all-time high (ATH) of $2.39 on June 12, 2024. Following the unlock event, ARB traded as high as $1.96 but dipped to $1.61 within 48 hours. </p>
<p>The token has managed to reclaim the $1.68 level despite being in the red zone over the past 24 hours if the price drops further, ARB&#8217;s potential support walls are identified at $1.56, $1.46, and potentially as low as $1.32.</p>
<h2>Arbitrum Post-Unlock Journey </h2>
<p>NewsBTC <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/arbitrum/arbitrum-arb-faces-potential-selling-pressure-as-1-billion-tokens-become-unlocked-in-march/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">reported</a> that there has been only one previous unlock event for ARB tokens. On the first day after the unlock, ARB experienced a 3% increase, indicating positive market sentiment and initial demand. </p>
<p>However, the token&#8217;s price gradually declined, reaching a low of -21% approximately 21 days after the unlock event. Interestingly, around the 25-day mark, the price began significantly recovering, surging by 19% above the unlock-day level. </p>
<p>These patterns suggest that while Arbitrum may face initial downward pressure post-unlock, there is potential for recovery and positive price movement in the following weeks.</p>

<p>The future trajectory of ARB&#8217;s price action remains uncertain despite experiencing a 15% drop from its first unlock day. Drawing from the past <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/uniswap/uniswap-expands-reach-deploys-v2-protocol-on-six-new-chains-including-arbitrum-and-polygon/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">unlock event</a>, if historical patterns hold, there may be a further 6% decrease, aligning with the previous 21% drop observed 25 days after the first Arbitrum unlock event. </p>
<p>This hypothetical scenario would place Arbitrum at $1.57, indicating a favorable mid-term <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/arbitrum/buy-sell-trade-arbitrum-network/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">uptrend structure</a>.</p>
<p>However, it is crucial to note that past patterns do not guarantee identical outcomes in current price trading. Nevertheless, analyzing historical data can provide valuable insights and help understand and assess potential price movements.</p>

<title>Solana Surpasses Ethereum In Major Metric Amid Surge Above $200</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-ethereum-surge-200/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-ethereum-surge-200/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。Solana在加密货币领域变得越来越流行，网络活动超过了以太坊。3月16日，Solana的网络活动大幅增加，超过了以太坊的日交易量。网络容量达到极限，导致交易失败和ping时间增加。Solana的价格也在上涨，市值稳步接近1000亿美元。随着对Solana的兴趣和需求增加，其在市值排名上成功跻身第四位，并创下了全球谷歌搜索兴趣的新高。 <div>
<p>Solana has recently become one of the trendiest cryptocurrencies in the space, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-sol-massive-870-premium/">capturing the interest </a>of both crypto investors and enthusiasts in the space. The popular cryptocurrency has witnessed a significant <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-sol-transaction-volume-breaks-the-charts/" rel="nofollow">surge in network activity</a>, surpassing even that of Ethereum, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. </p>
<h2>Solana Outpaces Ethereum Network Activity</h2>
<p>On March 16, Solana experienced a major increase in its overall network activity, pushing its capacity to its limits amidst the growing demands. The network had surged past <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-ethereum-trading-volume-over-40-billion/" rel="nofollow">Ethereum’s total trading volume</a> and exceeded its daily trading volume by more than $1.1 billion, according to <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Solana" rel="nofollow">data</a> by DefilLama.   </p>

<p>Specifically, Solana’s 24-hour <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana-defi-landscape-thrives-with-record-11-billion-trading-volume/">trading volume</a> had recorded almost $3 billion, surging past Ethereum’s daily volume of $2.04 billion. During the surge, the network witnessed an unprecedented amount of trading activities, which resulted in failed transactions and a surge in ping times. </p>
<p>As <a href="https://explorer.solana.com/" rel="nofollow">highlighted</a> by Solana Validator, the cryptocurrency network’s ping time on March 18, had jumped to a staggering 46 seconds, causing about a 30% to 40% failed transactions. The validator’s report also revealed a steady and rapid increase in <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-transaction-volumes-700-200/" rel="nofollow">Solanan’s transaction count</a>, recording over 276 million transactions at the time of writing, with about 2,107 transactions per second. </p>
<p>This rise in <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/from-outage-to-recovery-solana-price-bounces-back-with-network-restart-in-full-swing/">Solana’s network activity</a> has been attributed to the surge in interest in <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/god-candle-solana-meme-coin/">Solana-based meme coins</a>. On Thursday, March 14, degens eagerly sought after a new meme coin called <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/meme-coin/introducing-book-of-meme-bome-the-latest-1-billion-crypto-sensation/">Book of Meme (BOME)</a>, which had experienced an unprecedented bullish spike that triggered its market capitalization to rise from almost zero to a staggering $1.45 billion. </p>
<p>During these periods, the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-price-will-climb-to-750/">price of Solana</a> also rallied alongside, witnessing an unexpected price surge that propelled it by more than 30% in the past week. The cryptocurrency has been on a steady momentum since the beginning of the year, displaying slight <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/company/solana-price-drops-as-altcoin-market-falters-is-it-too-late-to-buy-sol/">price corrections</a> before continuing on its upward trajectory. </p>
<h2>SOL Price Rides The Bullish Wave</h2>
<p>Amidst Solana’s burgeoning popularity and rising transaction volumes, the cryptocurrency saw a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/sol-price-crosses-200/">price increase to more than $200</a>, reflecting a daily surge of approximately 8.9%, at the time of writing. The cryptocurrency’s <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-market-cap-1000-crypto-fund-ceo/">market capitalization</a> is also up by 11.10%, recording over $89 billion and steadily closing towards the $100 billion mark. </p>

<p>Due to its overwhelming network activities and <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solanas-biggest-memecoin-gains-681000-in-3-days-as-more-investors-bet-on-its-popularity/">growing popularity</a>, Solana has successfully gained the position of the 4th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-chasing-bnb-chain-race-to-5-market-dominance-heats-up/">overtaking BNB Chain (BNB)</a> by more than four billion, according to CoinMarketCap. </p>
<p>Moreover, the cryptocurrency has <a href="https://x.com/solanafloor/status/1769599178013823394?s=46" rel="nofollow">reached</a> peak levels globally in terms of Google search interest,  hitting a new all-time high. This surge has been attributed to the increasing interest and demand for the popular digital asset. </p>

<title>Solana Memecoin Presale Gone Wrong: Creator Accidentally Burns $10M, Whale Makes Huge Profit</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。新的Solana基于项目Slerf (SLERF)在推出后遭遇了问题，大部分代币供应在意外中被烧毁。项目的发起人在试图烧毁流动性池中的代币时出现错误，导致预售参与者的代币也被烧毁。鲸鱼利用这一情况赚取了数百万美元，引发社区的质疑。发起人承诺寻找方式来偿还预售参与者，但SLERF的价值在发布后波动不定。 <div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A new <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-tokens-among-top-gainers-jup-and-wen-soar-over-12-wif-hits-new-ath/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Solana-based</a> memecoin launched today, becoming the talk of the town, and whales have noticed it. However, the reasons behind this might be different from what everybody expects.</p>
<p>Since its launch, Slerf (SLERF), the newest Solana-based project, has been trending for all the wrong reasons. The project successfully raised $10 million during its presale and saw most of the token supply burned by accident.</p>



<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Solana Memecoin Launch Sees Millions Gone</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Just a few hours ago, the Slerf creator and the presale investors were full of excitement and expectation as the token’s launch approached. Everything appeared normal as the project’s X account <a href="https://twitter.com/Slerfsol/status/1769620303229952445" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> it had successfully burned $10.8 million worth of SLERF.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">For context, the project’s website states that the “slerfnomics” included a total supply yet to be determined, with 50% of the tokens to be sent into the Liquidity Pool (LP) and 50% for the presale participant’s airdrop. Additionally, the tokens in the LP would be burned at launch, and ownership would be revoked.</p>
<p><img alt="slerf, memecoin, sol" class="size-large wp-image-598533 aligncenter" height="310" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Captura-de-Pantalla-2024-03-18-a-las-7.41.15-a.-m.png?w=860&#038;resize=860%2C310" width="860" /></p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">However, investors seemed confused about the amount burned and where the airdrop tokens would come from. Before realizing their mistake, the creator explained that the airdrop to the presale participants wasn’t done before the burn because “it was the safest way.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The community quickly <a href="https://x.com/devtonic_sol/status/1769620999212028259?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">realized</a> that something had gone wrong, as it seemed the project’s team had no tokens left for the airdrop. The creator realized the mistake shortly after and announced it on X while apologizing.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Guys I fucked up. I burned the LP and the tokens that were set aside for the airdrop,” the <a href="https://twitter.com/Slerfsol/status/1769628592315748403" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> read. He further explained that the mistake was a “simple mindless misclick” while burning the LP.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It was further explained that after the first attempt to <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/shiba-inu-mania-price-surges-60-as-burn-rate-heats-up-by-over-22000/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">burn</a> the tokens failed, the creator checked the Sol incinerator and couldn’t see the LP tokens. As a result, he decided to clean the wallet of the “shitcoins” sent there. This action accidentally burned the presale token’s supply alongside the other tokens.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The mistake proved irreversible as the minting authority had already been revoked. Neither the creator nor the developers could access the burned tokens or mint new ones for the presale participants.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">From Sloths To Whales: Millions Made In 12 Minutes</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Whales took the opportunity to profit big on this Solana-based memecoin drama, as reported by Lookonchain.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The blockchain research platform <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1769663277561430111" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">revealed</a> that a whale wallet with over $32 million worth of SOL spent $606,000 (3,024 SOL) to buy 1.7 million SLERF. This wallet had never bought any tokens, and its newly acquired SLERF accounted for $1.5 million in unrealized profits a couple of hours ago.</p>

<p></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A different whale wallet spent 9,894 SOL (worth $1.98 million) to buy almost 70 million SLERF immediately after opening trading. In 12 minutes, the trader sold the memecoin for 25,001 SOL (worth around $5 million) and made over $3 million <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/pepe-whale-makes-8-13m-in-profit-as-bullish-rally-continues/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">in profit</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">However, these transactions raised the alarms of the presale investor and the community. Doubts of the “accidental burn of tokens” being much more than a mistake are high, as replies to the post suggest.  Many users believe these movements to be from “insiders” and not “lucky people.”</p>

<p></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Slerf creator <a href="https://x.com/Slerfsol/status/1769710069581512822?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">guaranteed</a> it was an honest mistake during an X Space session. He also stated his principal concern was to make things right for those who saw their investment vanish.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, he committed to finding a way to refund the presale participants. As of this writing, Slerf is live on X Space, asking the community for suggestions on how to repay them.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The SLERF pumped to $1.24 after its launch, over 43.4% in an hour. The token’s price has decreased by over 52%, trading at $0.59 at writing time.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />Standard Chartered银行的最新研究对比特币（BTC）和以太坊（ETH）提供了非常看涨的展望，预计到2024年底甚至更长时间，比特币可能达到15万美元，而以太坊可能达到8000美元。银行的研究深入探讨了推动比特币可能飙升至15万美元的因素，包括比特币现货交易所交易基金（ETF）的推出和以太坊最近的Dencun升级。银行认为，这些三项关键分析为Standard Chartered对比特币估值奠定了基石。银行还预测了以太坊到2024年底可能达到8000美元的路径，这取决于Dencun升级和预计的ETH现货ETF批准。展望到2025年及以后，银行认为ETH对比BTC的价格比率将回到7%水平，预计以太坊价格将在2025年底达到14000美元。<br /> <div>
<p>Standard Chartered&#8217;s latest research <a href="https://twitter.com/FinBizJedi/status/1769667188439560483" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">notes</a> offer a very bullish outlook for the major digital assets, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), by the end of 2024 and beyond. The bank&#8217;s analysts project Bitcoin could reach $150,000, while Ethereum could hit the $8,000 mark.</p>
<p>These projections come amidst a backdrop of significant developments in the crypto space, including the launch of Bitcoin spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and Ethereum&#8217;s recent Dencun upgrade.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin&#8217;s Path To $150,000</h2>
<p>The bank&#8217;s research delves deep into the factors propelling Bitcoin&#8217;s potential surge to $150,000 by year-end. Central to this projection is the influence of Bitcoin spot ETFs, which, since their <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/breaking-news-ticker/breaking-sec-approves-all-11-spot-bitcoin-etfs-btc-price-holds-steady-at-46000/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">launch on January 11</a>, have seen rapid inflows exceeding increases in open interest.</p>

<p>According to the bank, this suggests a more robust and sustainable positioning for Bitcoin, distinct from previous speculative peaks. &#8220;Rapid inflows to the new Bitcoin (BTC) spot ETFs have dominated [&#8230;] Most of the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitwise-ceo-bitcoin-ipo-moment-what-it-means-for-price/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">inflows are likely to be sticky</a> pension-type flows,&#8221; Geoff Kendrick and Suki Cooper elucidate, highlighting the newfound stability in Bitcoin investment trends.</p>
<p>Three pivotal analyses form the cornerstone of Standard Chartered&#8217;s Bitcoin valuation:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Gold Analogy:</strong> Drawing parallels with the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/cathie-wood-bitcoin-gold/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">gold market&#8217;s response</a> to the introduction of US gold ETFs, the bank estimates Bitcoin could rise to the $200,000 level, marking a 4.3x increase from its pre-ETF price.</li>
<li><strong>Two-Asset Optimization:</strong> By optimizing a portfolio with 80% gold and 20% Bitcoin at current gold prices, the analysis suggests a Bitcoin level around $190,000.</li>
<li><strong>ETF Inflows Correlation:</strong> Linear extrapolation based on the correlation between ETF inflows and Bitcoin price points to a possible $250,000 level, assuming total ETF inflows around the bank&#8217;s midpoint estimate of $75 billion.</li>
</ol>
<p>Standard Chartered notes that these three measures suggest “that $200,000 is the &#8216;correct&#8217; end-2025 price level for BTC, [&#8230;] and that it is likely to be the new midpoint for a sideways trading range at that time.”</p>

<p>Further the research notes that an “overshoot to $250,000 is likely at some point in 2025 if ETF inflows continue apace and/or reserve managers buy BTC.” Previously, the bank only <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/mark-your-calendars-bitcoin-to-hit-100000-by-end-of-2024-standard-chartered-says/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">predicted</a> a Bitcoin price of $100,000 by the end of 2024.</p>
<h2>Ethereum&#8217;s Road To $8,000</h2>
<p>Ethereum&#8217;s expected climb to $8,000 by the end of 2024 is anchored in two transformative developments: the Dencun upgrade and the expected approval of ETH spot ETFs. The recent <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/dencun-upgrade-officially-deployed-on-ethereum-mainnet-eth-price-holds-steady-below-4000/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Dencun upgrade</a>, by significantly lowering transaction costs on layer 2 blockchains, enhances Ethereum&#8217;s competitive edge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ethereum (ETH) has just undergone the ‘Dencun’ upgrade, which dramatically lowers the cost of transactions [&#8230;] making ETH more competitive,&#8221; the research notes.</p>
<p>The forecast also hinges on the anticipation of US SEC approval for ETH ETFs by May 23, a decision poised to catalyze substantial inflows into Ethereum. Drawing from the Bitcoin ETF experience, Standard Chartered expects similar enthusiasm for Ethereum, with projected inflows of 2.39-9.15 million ETH (equivalent to roughly $15-45 billion).</p>
<p>This substantial capital infusion is seen as a crucial lever for Ethereum&#8217;s price surge. &#8220;We expect significant ETF-driven inflows to ETH [&#8230;] This could drive ETH to the $8,000 level by end-2024,&#8221; the bank elaborates, underscoring the parallel potential for growth akin to Bitcoin&#8217;s trajectory.</p>
The Prognosis For 2025 And Beyond
<p>Looking further ahead, Standard Chartered ventures into the terrain of 2025 predictions, where the bank sees the ETH-to-BTC price ratio ascending back to the 7% level, a hallmark of the 2021-22 period.</p>
<p>This adjustment forecasts an Ethereum price of $14,000 by the end of 2025, given the projected Bitcoin level of $200,000. Such a scenario underscores the bank&#8217;s optimism about the enduring value proposition and growth potential of these leading digital assets in the medium term.</p>
<p>At press time, BTC traded at $68,401.</p>

<title>Shiba Inu Open Interest Suffers 40% Crash, What Does This Mean For Price?</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-open-interest-40-crash/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-open-interest-40-crash/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。<br />Shiba Inu的开放利益经历了一次急剧下跌，下跌超过40％。这表明对该加密货币的兴趣正在减少，可能导致价格下跌。历史数据显示，开放利益的下降通常会与价格下跌相一致。然而，当前的牛市周期仍处于早期阶段，可能有更多需求来避免价格崩盘。 <div>
<p class="p2">The Shiba Inu open interest has hit a snag after a particularly good run. The open interest had <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/forget-dogecoin-shiba-inu-set-to-become-the-top-dog-expert-predicts-100-billion-market-cap/">risen quickly alongside the price</a> of the meme coin, which climbed close to its previous all-time high earlier in March. However, the cryptocurrency has been unable to maintain this uptrend, leading to a significant drop in the open interest.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Shiba Inu Open Interest Sees Over 40% Decline</h2>
<p class="p2">According to <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/BitcoinOpenInterest" rel="nofollow">data</a> from Coinglass, the Shiba Inu open interest had hit a new two-year high on March 6 when its price crossed over the $0.000032 threshold. Since then, however, it has been on a decline, seeing a near-constant decline each day since.</p>

<p class="p2">By Monday, March 18, the Shiba Inu open interest had dropped from its $135 million all-time high to just $80 million. This decline translates to an over 40% decrease in the space of two weeks. At the same time, the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/crypto-analyst-shiba-inu-target/">price of the meme coin</a> has followed the same trend and has dropped from its yearly highs above $0.00004 to $0.000028 at the time of writing.</p>
<p class="p2">Now, the open interest for any cryptocurrency is important because it serves as a measure of the total interest in that asset at any given time. It basically shows the total number of all futures and/or options contracts for a particular asset. So in this case, it shows the amount of money invested in <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-whales-shib/">SHIB</a> derivative products at any time.</p>
<p class="p2">Given this, an increase in the open interest can be bullish for a cryptocurrency such as Shiba Inu, while a decrease can be bearish. This is because, the lower the open interest, the less money is being put into that particular asset, thereby decreasing the demand. So this could negatively affect the price.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Will SHIB Price Continue To Decline?</h2>
<p class="p2">As seen historically, a decline in open interest has often coincided with a decline in price. As such, the present decline being experienced by Shiba Inu could spell bad news for its price going forward. The effect is already being felt with the price of SHIB dropping significantly over the weekend, although it has started to recover as the new week opens up.</p>

<p class="p2">To get an idea of where the price might be headed next, we can take a look at the last time that the Shiba Inu open interest was this high, back in 2021. The open interest had reached its current all-time high in October 2021, but after peaking, both the open interest and the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-whales-shib/">SHIB price</a> would suffer tremendously.</p>
<p class="p2">Over the course of the next few months, the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/forget-dogecoin-shiba-inu-set-to-become-the-top-dog-expert-predicts-100-billion-market-cap/">SHIB price</a> would fall more than 50%, following the same trend as the open interest. If this trend were to continue this time around, then the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-whales-shib/">SHIB price</a> may be headed for a price crash.</p>
<p class="p2">However, 2021 marked the end of the bull market, while the current bull cycle is only in the beginning stages. In this case, there is more demand, which would mean there is more of a cushion to mitigate a price crash.</p>

<title>Shiba Inu Price Soars 10% In Reaction To Explosive 2,367% SHIB Burn Surge</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />Shiba Inu（SHIB）是一种以太坊网络上的加密货币，最近经历了大幅上涨，吸引了全球加密货币爱好者的兴趣。这次价格上涨的原因有多方面，包括市场情绪的增长、社交媒体的影响、名人和意见领袖的背书等。Shibburn的数据显示，Shiba Inu的销毁率在过去24小时激增，社区的销毁活动和加密货币的供需动态引发了对SHIB的看涨情绪。此外，SHIB的价格也出现了显著上涨，交易量增加，并且有望突破关键价格点，恢复并超越前期最高点。 <div>
<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB), a prominent Ethereum-based cryptocurrency, witnessed a substantial rally, bolstering the interest of crypto enthusiasts worldwide. The nearly 10% surge in price on Monday has been attributed to a wave of market optimism, coinciding with a significant burn surge revealed by Shibburn, the meme coin&#8217;s burn tracker.</p>
<p>The recent rally of meme coins can be attributed to various factors. Firstly, the growing market sentiment and excitement surrounding meme coins have attracted investors seeking high-risk, high-reward opportunities.</p>
<p>Additionally, the influence of social media platforms, viral marketing, and endorsements from celebrities and influencers have played a significant role in driving up the prices of meme coins.</p>

<h2><strong>Shiba Inu Burn Surge Analysis</strong></h2>
<p>According to Shibburn&#8217;s data, the burn rate for Shiba Inu skyrocketed by a <a href="https://www.shibburn.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">staggering 2,367%</a> over the past 24 hours, resulting in the destruction of a whopping 186 million coins.</p>
<p>This surge in burning activity has further heightened market optimism surrounding the meme token, as the Shiba crypto community continues to make remarkable efforts to enhance the SHIB tokenomics.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-598478" height="334" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Shibburn.png?resize=381%2C334" width="381" /></p>

<p>The continuous depletion of SHIB&#8217;s supply through burning activities has triggered discussions about the dynamics of supply and demand, igniting a hurricane of bullish sentiments for Shiba Inu. Notably, it is the community&#8217;s concerted efforts, including significant transfers to a dead wallet, that have primarily contributed to the rise in the burn rate.</p>
<p>Shibburn&#8217;s insights shed light on two massive transactions by the Shiba crypto community, both involving transfers to a dead wallet. The first transaction saw a transfer of 168 million coins, while the second involved the transfer of 16.68 million SHIB.</p>
<p>These actions reflect the community&#8217;s determination to bolster the tokenomics of <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Shiba Inu</a> and have further contributed to the burn surge witnessed recently.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/uVSbXZKK/" width="1835" /></p>

<h2><strong>SHIB Price Climbs Amid Optimism</strong></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">positive momentum</a> extends beyond burning activity, as Shiba Inu&#8217;s price experienced a substantial uptick of 10% over the past 24 hours, reaching a current trading value of $0.0000287.</p>
<p>This surge in price has been accompanied by a surge in trading volume by nearly 23% and a market cap increase of 10%, firmly establishing a<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/shiba-inu" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> bullish stance for SHIB.</a> However, it is important to note that the recent correction in Bitcoin&#8217;s price led to a temporary dip for Shiba Inu, which reached a low of $0.0000238.</p>

<p>With the recent upward movement, there is growing optimism that SHIB may breach the $0.00003 mark, potentially paving the way for a recovery trend that could push prices above the previous swing high of $0.000045 and even surpass the $0.00005 milestone.</p>
<p>Market observers are particularly encouraged by the burning chronicles of the meme coin, which further contribute to the prevailing market optimism.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Sentiment Cools Off, Price Rebound Soon?</title>

<div> 
<br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />最近比特币恐惧与贪婪指数显示情绪有所降温，为可能的反弹铺平了道路。指数考虑波动性、交易量、社交媒体情绪、市值主导和谷歌趋势。当前，投资者持有极度贪婪的心态，但指数现在为77，显示情绪有所减缓。先前最高点与极端贪婪情绪重合，而最低点通常发生在市场处于极度恐惧区域时。比特币价格周末暴跌至64,500美元，但在过去一天中已经有所恢复，目前回升至68,000美元。 <div>
<p>The Bitcoin Fear &amp; Greed Index shows that the sentiment around the asset has cooled off a bit recently, something that could pave the way for a rebound.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Fear &amp; Greed Index Has Gone Through Some Decline Recently</h2>
<p>The &#8220;<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/crypto-fear-greed-index-drops-to-one-month-low-heres-what-it-means/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Fear &amp; Greed Index</a>&#8221; is an indicator created by <a href="https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Alternative</a> that tells us about the average sentiment present among the investors in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency market</p>
<p>To determine the trader mentality, the index takes into consideration for these five factors: volatility, trading volume, social media sentiment, market cap dominance, and Google Trends.</p>

<p>The metric uses a numeric scale that runs from zero to hundred for representing this sentiment. A score of 46 or less implies the presence of fear among the investors, while that of 54 and above suggests greed in the market.</p>
<p>The territory between these two (47 to 53) naturally corresponds to the neutral mentality. Besides these three sentiments, there are also two extreme sentiments called &#8220;extreme greed&#8221; and &#8220;extreme fear.&#8221;</p>
<p>The extreme greed occurs at values above 75, while the extreme fear takes place below 25. Historically, these two sentiments have been quite relevant for BTC&#8217;s trajectory.</p>
<p>Tops have generally tended to form when the investors have held the former sentiment, while bottoms have been probable to happen when the market has been in the latter region.</p>
<p>At present, the traders are holding a mentality of extreme greed, as the latest data of the Bitcoin Fear &amp; Greed Index shows.</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Fear &amp; Greed Index" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-598440 aligncenter" height="329" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/meter_b48137.png?w=368&#038;resize=368%2C329" width="368" /></p>

<p>As is visible, the indicator&#8217;s value is 77 right now, meaning that while it&#8217;s indeed inside extreme greed, it&#8217;s only so just. This is a fresh change from how it has been recently, as the chart below displays.</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Extreme Greed" class="alignnone wp-image-598444 size-large aligncenter" height="406" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/chart_be381d.png?w=860&#038;resize=860%2C406" width="860" /></p>

<p>From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that the Bitcoin Fear &amp; Greed Index has mostly stayed deep inside the extreme greed region recently. On the 14th of this month, the indicator hit the 88 mark, and alongside this high, the BTC price registered its current all-time high of about $73,800.</p>
<p>Since this peak, though, the asset has <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-threatens-to-retreat-to-60000-as-bulls-seek-solid-ground/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">plunged</a>, and it appears that alongside it, so has the sentiment among the traders. As mentioned earlier, tops have been more likely to occur when the market has shared a mentality of extreme greed and this probability has generally only gone up the more extreme levels the metric has hit.</p>
<p>This could perhaps explain why the recent top occurred when it did. Another top this month, the one that took place on the 5th, also coincided with high values in the Fear &amp; Greed Index (a peak of 90 this time).</p>

<p>Shortly after this earlier peak and the plummet in the cryptocurrency that had followed, the asset found its bottom as the metric briefly exited the extreme greed region.</p>
<p>As the Bitcoin Fear &amp; Greed Index is once again looking to dip outside this territory, it&#8217;s possible that a bottom may be near for the price this time as well. It now remains to be seen if the sentiment would cool down enough in the coming days so as to leave the extreme region behind, at least temporarily.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>Bitcoin had plunged towards $64,500 during the weekend, but it seems the coin has made some recovery in the past day as it&#8217;s now back at $68,000.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Approaches Risky Territory As Halving Event Draws Near</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。文章讨论了比特币价格下跌的趋势，并预测在即将到来的分叉事件之前可能会进一步下降。专家指出在历史上，比特币在距离分叉事件前14-28天经常出现大幅回撤。此外，文章还介绍了比特币分叉的4个不同阶段，包括分叉前的上涨、最终分叉前的回撤、重新积累和抛物线上涨。文章强调了在暴涨之前通常会有一个多月的重新积累阶段。 <div>
<p>The <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-hits-support-65k/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">price of Bitcoin</a> has been on a downward trend since it reached a new all-time of $73,000, ushering in a wave of speculations regarding the crypto asset&#8217;s next direction in the short term.</p>
<p>In the past few days, Bitcoin&#8217;s recent dip has triggered a general crypto market retracement. With the Bitcoin Halving event fast approaching, many crypto analysts are anticipating a further decline in BTC&#8217;s price in the near future.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Poised For &#8220;Danger Zone&#8221; Ahead Of Halving Event</h2>
<p>Popular cryptocurrency trader and analyst Rekt Capital has <a href="https://x.com/rektcapital/status/1769465412322766993?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">shared</a> a gloomy prediction for Bitcoin with the crypto community on the social media platform X. His forecast examines BTC&#8217;s potential to drop even further prior to the halving event while noting the entrance to a risky area he dubbed the &#8220;Danger Zone.&#8221;</p>

<p>The analyst&#8217;s forecast came in light of BTC experiencing a notable decline in the past few days. According to the expert, two days from now, Bitcoin will formally venture into the danger Zone (orange). </p>
<p>This is the starting area of past retracements seen ahead of the BTC Halving, which is expected to take place in April. Prior to the halving, these retracements have constantly indicated intervals of substantial market corrections for the digital asset. </p>
<img alt="Bitcoin" class="size-medium wp-image-598467" height="325" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rekt-Capital-Bitcoin-Chart-1.jpg?w=460&#038;resize=460%2C325" width="460" />
<p>Rekt Capital further pointed out that the pre-halving retracements have historically been observed in BTC 14-28 days before the event. Bitcoin&#8217;s price witnessed a pullback of about 40% in advance of the 2016 halving occurrence. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, in 2020, the crypto asset fell by over 40% before the occasion. Presently, we are less than 30 days before this year&#8217;s <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/grayscale-next-bitcoin-halving-different/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">BTC halving</a> takes place; however, the price of the coin has declined by over 11% in the past week, suggesting further correction in the coming weeks. </p>
<p>The post read:</p>
<blockquote><p>In 2 days, Bitcoin will officially enter the &#8220;Danger Zone&#8221; (orange) where historical Pre-Halving Retraces have begun. Historically, Bitcoin has performed Pre-Halving Retraces 14-28 days before the Halving. In 2020, this retrace was -20% deep, and in 2016, this retrace was -40% deep. Currently, BTC is 30 days away from the Halving and has pulled back -11% this week.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is noteworthy that the crypto analyst had previously <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/historical-trends-unveil-bitcoin-peak-timing-in-current-bull-cycle/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">pinpointed</a> the timeframe BTC is expected to top out in this bull cycle. Rekt Capital believes the asset will peak within 280-350 days. Specifically, this could occur around mid-December this year, or in mid-February of next year.</p>
<h2>4 Distinct Halving Phases</h2>
<p>So far, the crypto analyst has <a href="https://x.com/rektcapital/status/1769656725341163692?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">highlighted</a> several different phases for the upcoming Bitcoin Halving; these include the Pre-Halving Rally, Final Pre-Halving Retrace, Re-accumulation, and Parabolic uptrend.</p>

<p>According to Rekt Capital, there usually is a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/whats-ahead-for-bitcoin-expert-forecasts-pre-halving-rally-as-early-as-next-week/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">pre-halving rally</a> approximately 60 days before the event takes place. For the final pre-halving retrace, it usually develops around 14 to 28 days ahead.</p>
<p>Furthermore, after the Pre-Halving pullback, a multi-month re-accumulation period follows. Lastly, the parabolic uptrend begins once Bitcoin exits the area of re-accumulation.</p>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。比特币价格在创纪录高点后出现剧烈价格回调，导致投资者担忧可能出现更多熊市迹象。分析人士指出，投资者情绪受到影响，地址活跃度下降，市场存在卖压。然而，一些技术分析显示60,000至67,000美元之间可能是买家的支撑区域。尽管眼下形势不明朗，一些分析师看好比特币的长期前景，认为当前回调是牛市的正常和健康部分。机构资本的可能回归也被认为是潜在的反弹催化剂。 <div>
<p>After a spectacular ascent to record highs, Bitcoin (BTC) is facing a reality check. The past week has seen a dramatic price correction, leaving investors wondering if this is a temporary setback or a sign of a more bearish future.</p>
<p>The world&#8217;s most popular cryptocurrency reached an<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> intraday low of $64,620</a> on March 17th, a significant drop from its recent peak above $73,000. This pullback has triggered a wave of pessimism, with analysts pointing to declining profitability and a drop in daily active addresses on the network.</p>

<h2><strong>A Bearish Shadow Looms</strong></h2>
<p>According to analysts, investor sentiment has been hurt by a series of descending peaks and failed upturns, while selling pressure remains rampant as we approach the &#8220;weekly candle close.&#8221; This sentiment is echoed by data from IntoTheBlock, which shows a sharp decline in the number of addresses &#8220;In the Money,&#8221; signifying a decrease in overall profitability within the Bitcoin network.</p>

<h2><strong>Finding Support: A Beacon of Hope?</strong></h2>
<p>However, not everyone is hitting the panic button. Technical analysis suggests a potential support zone for buyers between $60,000 and $67,000. Popular trader Skew highlights this area as a possible turning point, while also acknowledging significant spot selling from major exchanges like Coinbase and Binance.</p>

<strong>Bulls On The Horizon: Are The Giants Awakening?</strong>
<p>While the immediate future appears uncertain, some analysts remain bullish on Bitcoin&#8217;s long-term prospects. They view the current correction as a natural and healthy part of any bull run, pointing to historical data where similar pullbacks paved the way for further growth.</p>

<p>Adding fuel to the fire of optimism is the potential return of institutional capital. The recent resumption of buying from US Bitcoin ETFs and the prospect of a significant influx of funds from hedge funds and investment advisors in the coming months are seen as potential catalysts for a rebound.</p>


<p>Thomas Fahrer, CEO of Apollo, a decentralized online cryptocurrency platform renowned for its comprehensive crypto reviews and analysis of ETF inflows, echoes sentiments regarding X.</p>
<p>Fahrer characterizes the current state as a &#8220;Bear Trap&#8221; and pinpoints the resumption of buying from US Bitcoin ETFs on March 18 as a potential catalyst for an upward surge in X&#8217;s value.</p>

<p>Emphasizing the significance of increased institutional acceptance, Fahrer anticipates a surge in liquidity within Bitcoin ETFs, suggesting that substantial capital inflows from institutional investors have yet to materialize.</p>
<strong>The Verdict: Brace For A Volatile Week</strong>
<p>This week will be crucial for Bitcoin. The coming days will be a test of the cryptocurrency&#8217;s resilience and its ability to overcome the current selling pressure. If bulls can regain control and positive sentiment prevails, a return to record highs remains a possibility. However, if the downtrend continues, Bitcoin could face a more extended period of correction.</p>

<title>Solana Market Cap Set To Skyrocket 1,000%, Says Crypto Fund CEO</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-market-cap-1000-crypto-fund-ceo/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-market-cap-1000-crypto-fund-ceo/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章指出了Asymmetric的CEO兼CIO Joe McCann对Solana市值达到1万亿美元的乐观预测。McCann认为Solana胜过以太坊，因为以太坊的L1交易慢且昂贵，L2解决方案复杂，不适合零售用户。他认为Solana成功吸引了零售用户，尤其是通过与memecoin和投机交易的联合。Solana上的memecoin数量和交易量大幅增加，成为其吸引力和实用性的证明。McCann还比较了以太坊和Solana的市值，并认为Solana有潜力实现近10倍增长。Solana目前的交易价格为201.27美元。 <div>
<p>Joe McCann, the CEO and CIO of the crypto hedge fund Asymmetric, recently made a bold <a href="https://twitter.com/joemccann/status/1769497076667404528" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">statement</a> on X (formerly Twitter), forecasting a $1 trillion market cap for Solana. McCann&#8217;s argument hinges on several key points that detail why he believes Solana has achieved product-market fit (PMF) as &#8220;The Chain for Retail,&#8221; juxtaposing it against Ethereum&#8217;s challenges and perceived shortcomings for retail users.</p>
<h2>Solana Beats Ethereum</h2>
<p>McCann critiques Ethereum for not being designed with retail in mind, pointing out its slow and expensive Layer 1 (L1) transactions, alongside the user experience (UX) nightmare posed by its numerous Layer 2 (L2) solutions. He states, &#8220;Ethereum is not a chain designed for retail &#8211; the L1 is too slow and expensive and the L2s are (currently) a UX nightmare.&#8221;</p>
<p>The friction for new users, fragmented liquidity across over “40 L2s”, and the complications with bridging are highlighted as significant barriers to Ethereum&#8217;s adoption by a broader retail audience.</p>

<p>Turning his attention to corporate-backed open-source projects like Coinbase&#8217;s L2 solution, Base, McCann acknowledges their potential to solve some <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-fees-plunge-70-following-a-yearly-high-in-may/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">UX issues</a>. However, he also notes the inherent priority of such projects to serve corporate interests, often at the expense of broader community needs.</p>
<p>Despite his critique, he admits, &#8220;Most corporate open source ultimately ends up serving corporate priorities&#8230;and it should!&#8221; This acknowledgment underscores the complexity of balancing corporate involvement in blockchain development with the ecosystem&#8217;s decentralized ethos.</p>
<p>McCann attributes Solana&#8217;s rise to its ability to serve the retail segment effectively, particularly through its association with memecoins and speculative trading. Describing Solana as originally being &#8220;Blockchain at Nasdaq speed&#8221; for its high throughput and low latency, he notes a pivotal shift in its narrative towards retail.</p>

<p>He observes, &#8220;Not once has the concept of being The Chain for Retail<img alt="™" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" style="height: 1em;" /> ever surfaced. Until now.&#8221; This shift is largely credited to Solana&#8217;s embrace by the memecoin community and the speculative trading that follows, marking a clear PMF with retail users.</p>
<p>Highlighting the explosion of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/why-shiba-inu-pepe-dogecoin-are-far-from-done/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">memecoin speculation</a> on Solana, especially post-NFL season, McCann points out, &#8220;Since the NFL season ended, speculation on memecoins has exploded&#8230;<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/sponsored/bonk-price-prediction-next-big-altcoin-set-to-explode/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">BONK</a> and WIF are on Solana. [&#8230;] Thousands of them are being created everyday and trading volumes are exploding.”</p>
<img alt="Meme coins go parabolic" class="wp-image-598412 size-full" height="766" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GI6BLhYaIAApe5v.jpg?resize=1314%2C766" width="1314" />
<p>The extensive creation and trading volumes of these coins on Solana are seen as a testament to its appeal and utility for retail speculators. Notably, the majority of memecoins is on Solana, not Ethereum.</p>
<p>”Trading Bots aka the ‘<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bonk-price-jumps-over-30-as-robinhood-revolut-listing-speculations-gain-traction/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Robinhood</a>-ification of crypto’ has been driving the majority of the trading due to its&#8230;great UX. [&#8230;] And the majority of those bots are trading memecoins on Solana. Solana is now consistently flipping Ethereum in DEX volumes yet for some reason, SOL is still 1/4th the value of Ethereum, it was 1/8th just a few days ago,” McCann noted.</p>
<img alt="Trading bots " class="wp-image-598411 size-full" height="830" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GI6B9VAbAAAJc57.jpg?resize=1488%2C830" width="1488" />
<p>He contrasts Solana&#8217;s market cap with Ethereum&#8217;s, using their relative valuations to argue for Solana&#8217;s growth potential. With Ethereum valued at just under $500 billion and Solana at about $115 billion, he suggests that Solana&#8217;s path to a $1 trillion market cap represents a nearly 10x growth opportunity, far outpacing the potential for Ethereum.</p>
<p>&#8220;ETH to $1T is a double. SOL to $1T is nearly a 10x. Which horse are you gonna bet on? The fastest one, obviously,&#8221; McCann concludes, encapsulating his bullish outlook for Solana based on its retail-friendly ecosystem and the vibrant activity around memecoins.</p>
<p>At press time, Solana traded at $201.27.</p>
<img alt="Solana price " class="wp-image-598413 size-full" height="1673" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SOLUSD_2024-03-18_08-13-58.png?resize=3628%2C1673" width="3628" />

<title>SOL Price Crosses $200 Milestone, What’s Next For Solana?</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/sol-price-crosses-200/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/sol-price-crosses-200/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。Solana价格超过了$200关键阻力位，并显示出继续上涨的迹象。随着价格上涨，下一个重要的阻力位将是$205和$212。如果成功突破$212，可能会进一步上涨至$220水平。支撑位在$195和$175附近，以及在$165和$150水平。技术指标显示MACD朝着多头方向走高，RSI也位于50水平以上。 <div>
<p><em>Solana is gaining bullish momentum above $200. SOL price is still showing positive signs, and it could even surpass the $220 resistance in the near term.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>SOL price gained bullish momentum and cleared the $200 resistance against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>The price is now trading above $200 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $195 on the 4-hour chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken).</li>
<li>The pair could continue to rally if it clears the $205 and $212 resistance levels.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Solana Price Extends Rally</h2>
<p>Solana price remained strong above the $150 level and extended its <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/sol-price-breaks-150/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">rally</a>. There was a decent increase above the $165 and $180 levels.</p>
<p>The price is up nearly 20% and there was a move above the $200 level, outperforming Bitcoin and <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-grinds-lower-3400/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ethereum</a>. A new multi-month high was formed near $204, and the price is now consolidating gains. It is stable above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $142 swing low to the $204 high.</p>
<p>There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $195 on the 4-hour chart of the SOL/USD pair. Solana is now trading above $200 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Solana_f3319d.png?resize=1024%2C461"><img alt="SOL Price" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-598388" height="461" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Solana_f3319d.png?resize=1024%2C461" width="1024" /></a></p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/SOLUSD/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SOLUSD on TradingView.com</a></p>
<p>Immediate resistance is near the $205 level. The next major resistance is near the $212 level. A successful close above the $212 resistance could set the pace for another major increase. The next key resistance is near $220. Any more gains might send the price toward the $232 level.</p>
<h2>Are Dips Supported in SOL?</h2>
<p>If SOL fails to rally above the $205 resistance, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $195 level and the trend line.</p>
<p>The first major support is near the $175 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $142 swing low to the $204 high, below which the price could test $165. If there is a close below the $165 support, the price could decline toward the $150 support or the 100 simple moving average (4 hours) in the near term.</p>
<p>Technical Indicators</p>
<p>4-Hours MACD – The MACD for SOL/USD is gaining pace in the bullish zone.</p>
<p>4-Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for SOL/USD is above the 50 level.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的<br />MEMECOIN项目Book of Meme（BOME）在加密市场上迅速崭露头角，吸引了投资者的兴趣，并在48小时内达到了10亿美元的市值。Book of Meme由DarkFarms创立，旨在结合Meme、去中心化存储解决方案、degen shitcoin交易和赌博，为用户创造新颖的web3体验。BOME在Binance上市后价格急剧上涨243%，市值达到15.5亿美元。投资者从BOME的涨势中受益，有人在预售时以19,000美元的投资获得340倍收益。当前，BOME的价格为0.02139美元，市值为11.8亿美元，居于第85位的加密货币。 <div>
<p>Memecoin project Book of Meme (BOME) has emerged as the latest shining star in the crypto market over the last few days. Following its official launch this week, BOME has attracted much investor interest, acquiring a market cap of $1 billion within 48 hours of trading.</p>
<p>BOME’s sudden emergence can be regarded as a silver lining in the crypto space in the last week amidst Bitcoin’s 4% decline, which resulted in the maiden cryptocurrency falling to around $65,345.14. Meanwhile, Ethereum is also down by 10%, while prominent memecoins <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-influencer-scams/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Dogecoin</a> and <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/behind-the-scenes-of-shiba-inu-12-plunge-what-on-chain-analysis-tells-us/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Shiba Inu</a> also recorded losses to the tune of 24.23% and 16.69% over the last seven days. </p>

<h2>What Is The Book Of Meme?</h2>
<p>The Book of Meme was founded by DarkFarms, the creator of another popular memecoin Pepecoin. BOME functions as an experimental project aimed at incorporating memes, decentralized storage solutions, degen shitcoin trading, and gambling on a single platform in a bid to create a novel web3 experience. </p>
<p>Following a successful presale that raised 10,131 SOL, BOME debuted in the crypto market on March 14 with an initial price of $0.0000496. Over the next two days, Book of Meme swiftly rose to a price region of $0.012 while achieving a market cap value of $1 billion. </p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Due to the sudden listing by Binance, MEMECOIN BOME rose sharply by 243% in 24h, but other MEMECOINs generally fell sharply, PEPE WIF FLOKI BONK fell by more than 10%. The current market value of BOME has exceeded US$1.38 billion, ranking seventh in MEMECOIN in terms of market…</p>
<p>— Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1769015001304781183?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">March 16, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Unsurprisingly, BOME&#8217;s expeditious rise has earned the coin listings on major crypto platforms, including KuCoin, Gate.io, MEXC, HTX, Crypto.com and Binance. In particular, BOME’s listing on Binance on March 16 is believed to have spurred the token to a 243% price gain within a day, allowing the memecoin to gain a peak market cap of $1.55 billion. </p>
<p>In a similar fashion with other highly successful memecoins, some investors have benefitted the most from BOME’s rise.<a href="https://x.com/WuBlockchain/status/1769031149643501757?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> Data from LookonChain</a> reveals that a certain investor already sold all 347 million BOME for 34,647 SOL valued at $6.58 million, recording a 340x gain on 102 ($19,000) investment at the presale. Meanwhile, the largest BOME holding personal address known as sundayfunday.sol currently holds 1.242 billion BOME, valued at $29.8 million. </p>

<h2>BOME Price Overview</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, Book of Meme currently trades at $0.02139 with a 58.08% gain on the last day. Meanwhile, the coin’s daily trading volume is up by 125.05% and is valued at $5.18 billion. BOME’s current market cap stands at $1.18 billion, allowing the memecoin to rank as the 85th largest cryptocurrency. </p>

<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/forget-dogecoin-shiba-inu-set-to-become-the-top-dog-expert-predicts-100-billion-market-cap/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。Shiba Inu目标是达到1000亿美元市值，吸引了加密社区的注意。数据显示持有SHIB代币的地址数量激增，表明零售投资者对Shiba Inu的兴趣和采纳度在增加。大型交易数量也增加，显示机构投资者和鲸鱼积极参与。拥有50%总供应量的前100个地址表明拥有大金额SHIB的持有人对市场有潜在影响。尽管交易活动波动性较大，但Jake Gagain预测Shiba Inu有望超过Dogecoin，并达到1000亿美元市值。 <div>
<p>Shiba Inu, the meme coin sensation, is making headlines once again. With its sights set on a major achievement &#8211; a staggering $100 billion market cap &#8211; Shiba Inu has captured the attention of the crypto community.</p>
<p>This audacious ambition has been fueled by data from IntoTheBlock, shedding light on the coin&#8217;s potential. Additionally, renowned investor Jake Gagain has made a bold prediction, further igniting excitement within the crypto community.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SHIB&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">$SHIB</a> Will Be The First 100 Billion MC Memecoin. <a href="https://t.co/YogeSb2E7q" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/YogeSb2E7q</a></p>
<p>— JAKE (@JakeGagain) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeGagain/status/1768722585221566612?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">March 15, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<h2><strong>Shiba Inu: Growing Interest, Volatile Trading</strong></h2>
<p>According to analysis from IntoTheBlock, SHIB has witnessed a surge in the number of addresses holding the token. This surge indicates a growing interest and adoption of Shiba Inu among retail investors, who are eager to partake in the meme coin revolution.</p>
<p>Moreover, there has been a notable increase in the number of large transactions involving Shiba Inu tokens, suggesting institutional investors and whales are actively engaging with the coin.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-598265" height="216" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_b80e2e.png?resize=388%2C216" width="388" /></p>

<p><a href="https://app.intotheblock.com/register" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">IntoTheBlock&#8217;s data</a> reveals a concentration of wealth among the top holders of Shiba Inu. Approximately 50% of the total supply is held by the top 100 addresses, indicating the potential influence these large holders may have on the market dynamics and price movements of Shiba Inu. This concentration of wealth can play a significant role in shaping the future trajectory of the coin.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/0YSrdCdD/" width="1835" /></p>

<p>Trading activity surrounding the memecoin has also been a focal point of the analysis. The data highlights the volatility of Shiba Inu&#8217;s trading volume, with periods of intense fluctuations followed by relative stability. This volatility can be attributed to various factors, including market sentiment, news events, and overall market conditions.</p>
<h2><strong>SHIB $100 Billion Milestone</strong></h2>
<p>In the midst of this excitement, renowned investor Jake Gagain has made a bold prediction: He firmly believes that Shiba Inu has the potential to surpass Dogecoin and reach a remarkable $100 billion market cap. This prediction has sparked both enthusiasm and skepticism, as the rivalry between Shiba Inu and Dogecoin intensifies.</p>

<p>Taking all these factors into account, the journey towards the billion-dollar market cap for <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/shiba-inu-mania-price-surges-60-as-burn-rate-heats-up-by-over-22000/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Shiba Inu</a> is not without its challenges. While the recent surge in market cap and the accumulation by large holders are positive indicators, the volatility and concentration of wealth present potential risks that need to be navigated.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the resilience and determination exhibited by the memecoin, coupled with the growing interest from retail and institutional investors, provide a strong foundation for its pursuit of the $100 billion milestone.</p>
<p>Shiba Inu&#8217;s quest for a $100 billion market cap represents a paradigm shift in the world of meme coins. Backed by data from IntoTheBlock, which highlights growing adoption, concentration of wealth, and trading activity, as well as the bold prediction from Jake Gagain, SHIB has positioned itself as a formidable contender in the cryptoverse.</p>

<title>MATIC Price Slumps 10% Amidst Market Downturn – Here Are Key Levels To Watch</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。<br />马提克（MATIC）价格出现显著下跌，过去一周下跌超过10%，不到24小时下跌8%。数据显示大约10,900个地址在价位区间$1.02至$1.05购买了6.08亿MATIC，为该区间建立了关键支撑。如果这支撑破裂，下一个重要需求区域位于约$0.91。马提克当前价格为$1.04，市值超过97亿美元，排名第18。 <div>
<p><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/polygon/polygon-matic-whale-deposit-binance-bearish/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">MATIC, the native token of the Polygon network</a>, has witnessed a significant decline in its value. It has fallen by more than 10% in the past week and 8% in less than 24 hours as the general cryptocurrency market continues to grapple with a cloud of negative sentiment.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the latest on-chain analysis has revealed the important levels that investors should look out for following the latest decline in the MATIC price.</p>
<h2>Over 10,900 Addresses Bought 600 Million Polygon Tokens At This Price</h2>
<p>According to a recent <a href="https://x.com/ali_charts/status/1769135468208119809?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post on X</a> by crypto pundit Ali Martinez, the price of MATIC has established a key support around its current price point. This evaluation is based on analytics firm IntoTheBlock’s on-chain data, which tracks the average acquisition price for any given wallet address.</p>
<p><img alt="MATIC" class="aligncenter wp-image-598220 size-large" height="292" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GI06oELX0AA8aSo-1.jpeg?w=860&#038;resize=860%2C292" width="860" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Above is the chart highlighted by <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-long-positions-surge-on-bitfinex-whales-add-4230-btc-signaling-potential-price-reversal/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Martinez</a> that shows the distribution of the Polygon token supply across various price ranges. The size of the dots in the chart represents the magnitude of coins purchased around the corresponding price range.</p>

<p>Most notably, over 10,900 wallet addresses bought a whopping 608 million MATIC around the $1.02 and $1.05 zone. According to the crypto analyst, this massive buying activity has supported the establishment of crucial support around this price region.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Polygon?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">#Polygon</a> has found crucial support between $1.02 and $1.05, supported by 10,900 addresses holding around 608 million <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MATIC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">#MATIC</a>. Should this support falter, the next essential demand zone lies near $0.91, where 35,700 addresses collectively hold 394.6 million <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MATIC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">$MATIC</a>. <a href="https://t.co/rLn4ymcQf7" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/rLn4ymcQf7</a></p>
<p>— Ali (@ali_charts) <a href="https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1769135468208119809?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">March 16, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>While the large size of the dot reflects the strength of this particular level, sustained bearish pressure could cause the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/altcoins-watchlist-market-expert-spotlights-eth-blur-matic-and-more-for-explosive-gains/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">price of MATIC to breach</a> and fall beneath this support. In this case, investors could see the cryptocurrency drop to around $0.91.</p>
<p>This makes the $0.89 and $0.92 price range another level to watch, as it represents the next vital support area, where 35,680 wallet addresses purchased nearly 400 million Polygon tokens.</p>
<h2>MATIC Price Overview</h2>
<p>As of this writing, the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/matic/polygon-vesting-matic-price-3/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">price of MATIC</a> stands at $1.04, reflecting an 8% decline in the past 24 hours. This price dip comes after the altcoin printed a multi-month high of $1.28 on Thursday, March 14.</p>
<p>According to data from CoinGecko, the Polygon coin has suffered a 9.7% price slump in the last seven days. From a broader perspective, though, the cryptocurrency has had a fairly positive performance in the past month.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">With a market capitalization of more than $9.7 billion, the MATIC token ranks as the 18th-largest cryptocurrency in the sector.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Crashes: Dip To $65,000 Triggers Over $400 Million Liquidation Avalanche</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。比特币价格急剧下跌，导致市场动荡。在过去一周内，比特币价格下跌至65,000美元，其他加密货币也受到影响。市场分析师警告进一步下行风险，市场情绪不佳。总市场清算额超过4.26亿美元，长线交易者损失最严重。市场投资者开始重新评估策略。 <div>
<p>In a tumultuous turn of events, the cryptocurrency market has been rattled by a sharp decline in Bitcoin prices. After a sustained period of remarkable gains and record highs, Bitcoin has plunged to a weekly low of $65,000, marking a significant setback for investors.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bitcoin numbers were all painted in red,</a> and trading at $65,710, losing value in the 24-hour and weekly timeframes by 5.6% and 4.5%, respectively, according to data from Coingecko.</p>
<p>A few days after its previous low of $68,000, Bitcoin plummeted to its present level, a figure not seen in a week, as bears persisted in their downward pressure.</p>



<h2><strong>Altcoins Also Take A Beating</strong></h2>
<p>While Bitcoin bears the brunt of the downturn, altcoins are not spared from the fallout. Ethereum (ETH) and Binance Coin (BNB) have also witnessed<a href="https://coinank.com/liqMapChart" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> substantial losses</a>, shedding 10% of their value or more.</p>
<p>Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, two popular meme coins, have experienced even steeper declines, plunging by 20% and nearly 30%, respectively. The broader altcoin market mirrors Bitcoin&#8217;s downward trajectory, amplifying the sense of unease among investors.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/ISYm1HEA/" width="2475" /></p>

<strong>Bitcoin: Impact On Market Dynamics</strong>
<p>The recent price correction in Bitcoin has reverberated across the cryptocurrency landscape, reshaping market dynamics and investor sentiment. <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">The surge in liquidations</a>, with over 151,000 traders facing margin calls in the past 24 hours, underscores the magnitude of the market upheaval. Bitcoin&#8217;s dominance in the market is evident as it accounts for the lion&#8217;s share of the total liquidations, highlighting its pivotal role in shaping overall market trends.</p>
<p>As a result of the decline in value, the total market liquidations have reached $426 million, with Bitcoin taking the worst hit.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-598210" height="384" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_562718.png?resize=724%2C384" width="724" /></p>
<strong>Liquidation Spree</strong>
<p>The amount that the price of Bitcoin has liquidated over the last 24 hours has exceeded $104 million, with long traders losing the most money—they lost $86 million compared to $18 million for short sellers. Ethereum saw a $48 million overall liquidation, with $33 million going to long traders and $15 million going to short traders, as a result of the losing run.</p>
<strong>Analyst Sounds Alarm Siren</strong>
<p>Meanwhile, market analysts such as Markus Thielen, CEO of 10x Research, have sounded the alarm bells, warning of further downside risks for Bitcoin. Thielen&#8217;s prediction of a potential drop to $63,000 sends a sobering message to investors, urging caution and prudence in navigating the current market environment.</p>
<p>His insights shed light on underlying concerns about Bitcoin&#8217;s market structure, including low trading volumes and liquidity, which exacerbate the risk of sharp price corrections.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-598209" height="340" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_34d7be.png?resize=588%2C340" width="588" /></p>
<p>Amidst the market turbulence, investors are grappling with the implications of Thielen&#8217;s analysis and adjusting their strategies accordingly. The era of meme coin mania appears to be waning, prompting investors to reassess their positions and secure profits while they still can.</p>

<title>Grayscale Submits Revised Application For Ethereum Spot ETF – What’s New?</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/ethereum-news/grayscale-submits-revised-application-for-ethereum-spot-etf-whats-new/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/ethereum-news/grayscale-submits-revised-application-for-ethereum-spot-etf-whats-new/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。文章提到，Grayscale已向美国证券交易委员会更新了以太坊现货ETF的申请，但随着最近的提醒，SEC批准以太坊现货ETF的成功几率降至35%。两位民主党参议员强烈敦促SEC主席不要批准加密投资产品，并限制未来加密ETF申请。他们指出，这些产品可能给零售投资者带来巨大风险。当前以太坊代币价格为$3,731，过去一天上涨了1.2%。 <div>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-spot-etf-grayscale-outflows/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Asset management firm Grayscale</a> Investments has updated its application for an Ethereum spot ETF (exchange-traded fund) with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<h2 class="p1"><strong>Ethereum Spot ETF Case Just As Solid As Bitcoin’s, Grayscale Argues</strong></h2>
<p class="p1">According to a recent post on X by Craig Salm, Grayscale’s chief legal officer, the asset management firm has <a href="https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/nyse/markets/nyse-arca/rule-filings/filings/2024/SR-NYSEArca-2023-70_Am._1.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">revised its 19b-4 form</a> for an Ether spot ETF. Salm claimed that this move was “important” in an effort for Grayscale to list and trade shares of its Ether Trust on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Arca.</p>
<p class="p1">The chief legal officer <a href="https://x.com/CraigSalm/status/1768750794021511218?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">stated in his post</a> that investors “want and deserve access” to Ethereum via a spot exchange-traded product, likening the situation to the Bitcoin ETF story. “We believe the case is just as strong as it was for spot Bitcoin ETFs,” Salm said.</p>

<p class="p1">The asset manager is amongst the numerous firms <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/approval-denial-ethereum-etf-sell-the-news-event/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">looking to issue the first Ethereum spot ETF</a> in the United States, having filed an application with the SEC on October 10, 2023. However, these ETF applications have faced delays multiple times, with the most recent coming against BlackRock’s filing on March 4, 2024.</p>
<p class="p1">As a result, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-etfs-approval-odds-drop-to-35/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the likelihood</a> of the SEC approving an Ethereum spot ETF has taken a nosedive in recent weeks. Once-optimistic Bloomberg ETF expert Balchunas even revealed in his latest analysis that the ETH funds now have only a 35% chance of approval.</p>












<h2><strong>SEC Chairman Faces Pressure Over Crypto Approval</strong></h2>













<p class="p1">Two US senators of the Democrat party, Sens. Laphonza Butler of California and Jack Reed of Rhode Island, have urged the SEC chairman to avoid approving crypto investment products. In a letter dated March 11, the lawmakers, who are also members of the Senate Banking Committee, asked the Commission to limit future crypto ETF applications.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The success of the BTC spot products clearly ruffling some feathers on the Hill. <a href="https://twitter.com/SenatorJackReed?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">@SenatorJackReed</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Senlaphonza?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">@Senlaphonza</a> write to the <a href="https://twitter.com/SECGov?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">@SECGov</a> urging:-no further ETPs for other tokens-make life difficult (i.e. examinations/reviews) for brokers and advisers that recommend BTC ETPs <a href="https://t.co/enxdumC02N" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/enxdumC02N</a></p>

<p></p>
<p class="p1">Following the approval of 11 Bitcoin spot ETFs in January, the attention of the crypto public has somewhat turned to whether the SEC will do the same for the Ethereum versions. However, this latest letter from the senate seems to further <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-etfs-approval-outlook-fades-ahead-may-23/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">hurt the chances of an ETH ETF approval</a>.</p>

<p class="p1">A part of the letter read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">Retail investors would face enormous risks from ETPs referencing thinly traded cryptocurrencies or cryptocurrencies whose prices are especially susceptible to pump-and-dump or other fraudulent schemes,&#8221; they said. &#8220;The Commission is under no obligation to approve such products, and given the risk, it should not do so.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">As of this writing, the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-takes-hit-3680/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">price of the Ethereum</a> token stands at $3,731, reflecting a 1.2% increase in the past day.</p>
