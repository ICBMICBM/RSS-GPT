<div> <br><br>摘要：这些信息是积极的<br>
1. Ki Young Ju表示比特币牛市还未结束，展望了未来发展。
2. 据Realized Cap数据显示，比特币的四个年龄段的趋势表明潜在增长。
3. 成功的网络实施是比特币创下新高的主要动力，而不是即将到来的ETF事件。
4. 预测如果发生30%的最大回撤，比特币可能会下跌50%。
5. 零售投资者仍在逐渐涌入市场，尚未达到“比特币狂热”的高峰。<br> <div>
<p>Amidst the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crash-60800-worst-over-experts/">recent Bitcoin pullback</a> from its previous all-time high above $73,000, Ki Young Ju, the founder and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Crypto Quant, <a href="https://x.com/ki_young_ju/status/1770284065880727681?s=46" rel="nofollow">reassures</a> the broader crypto community that the BTC<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/founder-btc-bitcoin-bull-run-just-getting-started/" rel="nofollow"> bull market is far from over</a>. </p>
<h2>Bitcoin Bulls Are Not Done</h2>
<p>In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, Ju expressed strong bullish sentiment regarding Bitcoin, highlighting factors that suggest that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bull-market-huge-bubble/" rel="nofollow">Bitcoin’s upward trajectory is likely to continue</a>. The Crypto Quant CEO shared a crucial indicator depicted in a price chart, showcasing the percentage of Realized Cap across four age bands for BTC. </p>

<p>According to data from the price chart, the observed trends from the Realized Cap of four age bands from 6 months to three years indicate a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/coinbase-bitcoin-bull-run-2024/" rel="nofollow">positive outlook for BTC in 2024. </a></p>
<p>Additionally, the CEO has <a href="https://x.com/ki_young_ju/status/1770074028134580527?s=46" rel="nofollow">stated</a> that the primary catalyst behind Bitcoin’s rise to new all-time highs is the success of the<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/without-spot-bitcoin-etfs-btc-down-20-founder/" rel="nofollow"> Spot Bitcoin ETF</a>, rather than the upcoming <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-halving-and-spot-etfs-the-impending-btc-supply-shock/" rel="nofollow">Bitcoin halving</a> event in April. </p>
<p>After the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-cap-1-trillion-spot-etfs-launch-cryptoquant/">introduction of Spot Bitcoin ETFs</a>, BitcoBTCin embarked on an exponential rally, reaching heights not witnessed since its previous bull run in 2021. The cryptocurrency rose to record highs, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-whale-217-million-profit-btc-73000/">surpassing $73,000 </a>previously, but experienced a major pullback of about 8.33% over the past week. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s price is below $70,000, trading at $67,225, according to CoinMarketCap.</p>
<p>Ju has revealed <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-drop-prices-remain-below-70300/" rel="nofollow">possibilities for even more declines</a>, predicting a potential price drop of 50% for the cryptocurrency if a maximum drawdown of 30% occurs. The CEO has stated that for this event to happen, new whales, particularly ETF buyers, will have to enter the Bitcoin market at $56,000 on average. </p>
<p>While this outlook may seem bleak, the Crypto Quant founder has also <a href="https://x.com/ki_young_ju/status/1767875533243847035?s=46" rel="nofollow">expressed</a> strong belief in the continuation of the BTC bull market, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-suffers-crash-to-65000/">contingent upon the sustained momentum of ETF inflows.  </a></p>
<h2>Retail Investors Still Making Their Way Into The Market</h2>
<p>Reinforcing his belief that “Bitcoin is still in the middle of the bull cycle,” Ju asserts that the cryptocurrency’s <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-top-when-bull-run-peak-past-pattern/">cyclic top</a> has not yet been breached. The CEO <a href="https://x.com/ki_young_ju/status/1770057255716868353?s=46" rel="nofollow">suggested</a> that more price upswings were still set for Bitcoin, as retail investors have not fully entered the market yet.  </p>

<p>According to the Crypto Quant founder, only 50% of retail investors have <a href="https://x.com/ki_young_ju/status/1767336678820344256?s=46" rel="nofollow">entered</a> the market, indicating the halfway point towards “Bitcoin euphoria”. This suggests that if more retail investors flood the market, BTC could potentially rise to new peaks, driven by increased demand and capital inflows. </p>
<p>Echoing Ju’s convictions about Bitcoin’s long-term price increase, Bitcoin analyst Willy Woo encourages investors to <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-pre-halving-btc-rally-us-fed-decision/">embrace the dip</a> during the present consolidation phase. The analyst confidently <a href="https://x.com/woonomic/status/1769540830329716892?s=46" rel="nofollow">asserts</a> that “this is not the top,” but rather a simple period of consolidation reminiscent of previous all-time highs. </p>

<title>Crypto Analyst Touts Base As Next Memecoin Hotspot: Top 8 Picks</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/crypto-analyst-base-next-memecoin-hotspot-top-8/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/crypto-analyst-base-next-memecoin-hotspot-top-8/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />在文章中，加密货币分析师Xremlin指出Base成为memecoin爱好者和投资者的新兴中心，预测类似Solana的暴涨。他提到Coinbase与即将推出的产品将大幅降低新投资者的准入门槛，可能在Base平台上引发memecoin的暴涨。然而，分析师也警告跟随者要谨慎投资，因为memecoin投资涉及高风险。他列出了Base上的一些顶级加密memecoin，包括TOSHI、DEGEN、DOGINME、MOCHI、PONCHO、TYBG、BRIUN和ELONRWA。最后，他强调社区和研究在导航memecoin市场中的重要性。 <div>
<p>In an analysis shared with his nearly 100,000 followers on X (formerly Twitter), the crypto analyst known by the pseudonym Xremlin (@0x_gremlin) has pinpointed Base as the burgeoning hub for memecoin enthusiasts and investors. This proclamation follows a season of unprecedented gains in the Solana memecoin market, with tokens like BOME, WIF, and SLERF achieving returns ranging from 300x to 1000x.</p>
<p>Xremlin&#8217;s insight into the crypto market dynamics suggests a potential replication of these astronomical returns on Base, underlined by a tweet stating, “Meme traders on Solana printed millions this season: <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/meme-coin/introducing-book-of-meme-bome-the-latest-1-billion-crypto-sensation/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">BOME</a>: 800x, WIF: 1000x, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/sponsored/slerf-price-prediction-the-next-200x-memecoin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">SLERF</a>: 300x. BASE season is just revving up, and might have a similar rally.”</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Meme traders on Solana printed millions this season:<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BOME&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">$BOME</a>: 800x │ <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24WIF&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">$WIF</a>: 1000x │ <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SLERF&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">$SLERF</a>: 300x<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BASE&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">$BASE</a> season is just revving up, and might have a similar rally.</p>
<p><img alt="🧵" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f9f5.png" style="height: 1em;" />List of memes on Base with 10-500x potential⭣ <a href="https://t.co/wAs5hde0N9" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/wAs5hde0N9</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Xremlin (@0x_gremlin) <a href="https://twitter.com/0x_gremlin/status/1770740023593210047?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">March 21, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>The transition of focus towards <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/optimism-2/op-is-undervalued-skyrocket-coinbase-base/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Base</a> is attributed by the analyst to its association with Coinbase and an upcoming product launch aimed at simplifying on-chain trading. Xremlin elaborates, &#8220;Why Base? Coinbase has a large user base in the US, but trading on-chain can be too complex for normies. Soon, Coinbase will launch a product that enables its CEX users [100M+] to trade on Base without requiring seed phrases or private keys.&#8221;</p>
<p>This move is anticipated to significantly lower the entry barriers for new investors, potentially catalyzing a memecoin rally on the Base platform.</p>

<p>However, amidst the excitement, Xremlin issues a word of caution to their followers: “Remember: Investing in memes is high risk. Only bet what you can afford to lose. Projects might rug, slow rug, or suddenly tank by 50%-70% when the hype fades.” This cautionary advice reflects the inherent volatility and risk associated with memecoin investments, where the line between significant gains and losses can be remarkably thin.</p>
<h2>Diving Into The Top Crypto Memecoins On Base</h2>
<p>Xremlin&#8217;s curated list of Base memecoins is not only varied but also rich with potential, highlighting projects inspired by cultural references, pets of notable figures, and even caricatures of industry leaders. Here&#8217;s a closer look at the analyst&#8217;s picks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>TOSHI:</strong> Touted as a tribute to Brian Armstrong&#8217;s cat, named after the enigmatic Satoshi Nakamoto, TOSHI represents a playful investment opportunity. Xremlin notes, &#8220;TOSHI could be the flagship <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/press-releases/memecoin-mania-in-q4-2023-pepecoin-price-prediction-and-pikamoons-potential/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">memecoin</a> of Base, drawing on the crypto community&#8217;s reverence for Nakamoto and Armstrong&#8217;s influence.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>DEGEN:</strong> With its strategic distribution to Farcaster users, DEGEN taps into a community already engaged and familiar with crypto, setting a precedent for community-driven value.</li>
<li><strong>DOGINME:</strong> This memecoin capitalizes on the popular phrase &#8220;Got that dog in him,” embodying the resilience and tenacity celebrated in crypto trading circles.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>MOCHI and PONCHO:</strong> Both cat-themed coins seek to attract the attention of cat lovers, just as dog-themed memecoins such as Dogecoin, Shiba Inu and FLOKI attract that of dog lovers. MOCHI is based on Brian Armstrong&#8217;s pet.</li>
<li><strong>TYBG:</strong> Self-described as &#8220;The most based meme on Base,&#8221; it signifies the meta-culture of memes within the crypto space, where self-referential humor often garners substantial community support.</li>
<li><strong>BRIUN:</strong> A direct caricature of Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, BRIUN embodies the intersection of meme culture and crypto&#8217;s leadership, underlining the community&#8217;s penchant for satire.</li>
<li><strong>ELONRWA:</strong> Inspired by a sketch of Elon Musk, this project aims to bridge the gap between digital tokens and real-world assets, representing the innovative and often speculative nature of memecoin investments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Xremlin further emphasizes the importance of community and research in navigating the memecoin market: “For those interested in researching Base memes, I recommend joining the /base channel on Warpcaster. Community insight is invaluable, and collective due diligence can help mitigate risks associated with memecoin investments.”</p>
<p>At press time, TOSHI traded at $0.000321653, up 210% in the last three weeks.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Pullback Has Ended? Analyst Declares “Worst Is Over”</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-pullback-has-ended-analyst-declares-worst-is-over/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-pullback-has-ended-analyst-declares-worst-is-over/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章指出比特币价格已经触底，可能会出现上涨。分析师Crypto Jelle认为，比特币已经过去了最糟糕的时期，并预测价格将迅速恢复。同时，Crypto分析师Ali Martinez提出使用Dollar-Cost Averaging策略购买比特币的建议，根据特定价格水平购买不同数量的比特币。当前比特币价格为$67,299，日涨幅超过4%。市值增加4.97%，交易量下降12%。 <div>
<p>After a stunning retrace, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/why-is-bitcoin-price-up-today-key-reasons-explained/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin</a> witnessed a notable recovery as Wednesday closes rising from the $61,000 price mark to $67,000, triggering hopes within the cryptocurrency community that a bullish movement might be imminent. However, the crypto asset has not exactly returned to the point it was a week ago, especially since BTC reached a new all-time high last week when it surged beyond $73,000.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Correction Has Bottomed Out</h2>
<p>With Bitcoin surpassing its previous all-time high and rising even further to set a new peak of $73,000, March has been a momentous month for the cryptocurrency. And following the recent recovery, several cryptocurrency experts and traders believe that the recent<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crash-60800-worst-over-experts/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> price correction</a> has reached rock bottom.</p>

<p>Crypto analyst and enthusiast, Crypto Jelle has <a href="https://x.com/CryptoJelleNL/status/1770369529081627054?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">offered</a> a positive prediction regarding the price action of Bitcoin and its potential to move upward. His analysis delves into the current state of BTC&#8217;s price and the possibility of the retracement coming to an end.</p>
<p>According to Crypto Jelle, the average correction in &#8220;this bull market is almost 20%.&#8221; Meanwhile, the pullback is &#8220;roughly 18% deep&#8221; presently. As a result, Jelle believes that &#8220;we have most likely witnessed the worst of the drop,&#8221; suggesting that the price might be ready to undergo full recovery. </p>
<img alt="Bitcoin" class="size-medium wp-image-599022" height="236" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Crypto-Jelle-Bitcoin-Chart-1.jpg?w=460&#038;resize=460%2C236" width="460" />
<p>Jelle claims that the fall &#8220;should be bottoming out&#8221; any moment from now. However, this might not be happening soon, since &#8220;these things take time to form,&#8221; urging the crypto community not to rush it.</p>
<p>The post read:</p>
<blockquote><p>The average pullback in this bull market is almost 20%. Since the current downturn is just about 18% deep, the worst is most likely behind us. Although these things take time to form, the bottom should be close. Do not rust it.</p></blockquote>
<p>In another X <a href="https://x.com/CryptoJelleNL/status/1770557476183679264?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, Crypto Jelle noted that the market has once again begun to &#8220;display signs of a local bottom.&#8221; Due to this, the largest cryptocurrency asset <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/1-3-trillion-bitcoin-market-cap-sets-new-record-all-time-high/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">by market cap</a> still has &#8220;work to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Crypto Jelle anticipates Bitcoin to hold above the $65,300 threshold, in order for the price to &#8220;regain that 2021 bull cycle peak.&#8221; Additionally, when his forecast takes place, he believes that prices &#8220;will be off&#8221; in the upward direction in no time.</p>
<h2>Amount Of BTC To Buy Using DCA Strategy</h2>
<p>As Bitcoin continues to struggle, crypto analyst Ali Martinez has <a href="https://x.com/ali_charts/status/1770015684031840744?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">underlined</a> the amount of BTC to purchase within specific price levels using the Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) strategy.</p>

<p>According to Martinez, when BTC is within the range of $65,130, $64,130, $63,130, and $62,130, investors should buy 0.5 <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-whales-cashing-out/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">BTC</a>. Meanwhile, at the $61,130, $60,130, $59,130, and $58,130 levels, investors should acquire about 0.65 BTC.</p>
<p>Furthermore, around $57,130, $56,130, $55,130, and $54,130, Martinez advocates the acquisition of 0.8 BTC. Lastly, a portion of 0.95 BTC should be purchased around $53,130, $52,130, $51,130, and $50,130.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin was trading at $67,299 on the daily timeframe, indicating an increase of over 4%. Its market cap has risen by 4.97% in the past day, while its trading volume is down by over 12%.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Faces One Major Hindrance To Reaching New $75,000 All-Time High</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-hindrance-75000-high/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-hindrance-75000-high/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。文章指出比特币面临一些挑战，尽管价格在过去一天出现了令人印象深刻的反弹。比特币ETF的资金流出继续增加，这是首次自1月份以来连续三天出现净流出。出现净流出的主要原因是投资者逃离由于高费用而不受欢迎的Grayscale基金。这种情况类似于1月份，当时SEC批准了比特币期货交易后，比特币价格也出现了下跌。当资金流出放缓时，比特币价格有望获得增长空间。当前比特币价格为67320美元，过去24小时增长了5.51%。 <div>
<p class="p2"><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-pre-halving-btc-rally-us-fed-decision/">Bitcoin is still struggling to reclaim its all-time high</a> even after staging an impressive recovery in the last day. The bounce up from $60,000 to $68,000 has no doubt reignited confidence in the market, but the cryptocurrency continues to face some challenges in its bid for a new all-time high.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Outflows Continue To Rock Bitcoin ETFs</h2>
<p class="p2">Over the last few months, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-etf-floodgates-just-opening-bitwise-cio/">Spot Bitcoin ETFs</a> have done very well when it comes to inflows, hitting record after record. This saw issues such as BlackRock garner a large number of coins in a short time, which contributed to the Bitcoin run to new all-time highs.</p>

<p class="p2">However, as the market gets used to the Spot Bitcoin ETFs being a part of daily investing, outflows have begun to rise. Mainly, these outflows have been from the Grayscale <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-etf-frenzy-blackrock-smashes-expectations-with-788-million-inflows-in-one-day/">Spot Bitcoin ETF</a> as investors flee from the fund due to their high fees. The same was the case back in January which triggered a crash in the market.</p>
<p class="p2">In the last few days, outflows have been dominating the ETF net flows. Data from Coinglass shows that net flows first turned negative at the start of the week on March 18, with $154.3 million flowing out of the funds. The next day, March 19, another $326.2 million left the funds, leading to higher negative flows than the previous day. Then, on March 20, net flows were negative once more, with $261.5 million leaving the funds.</p>
<p class="p2">This trend marks the first time since January that Spot Bitcoin ETFs have seen three consecutive days of outflows, which is in stark contrast to the previous week, which saw daily inflows hit a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-etfs-see-record-1-billion-inflows/">new all-time high of $1.04 billion on March 12</a>.</p>
<h2 class="p2">BTC Price Buckles Under Sell Pressure</h2>
<p class="p2">The sell pressure Bitcoin is shouldering right now is similar to the one seen in January right after the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) had given the green light to <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-etf-frenzy-blackrock-smashes-expectations-with-788-million-inflows-in-one-day/">Spot Bitcoin ETFs</a> for trading. The <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-pre-halving-btc-rally-us-fed-decision/">BTC price</a> also suffered crashes during this time, dropping as low as $38,000.</p>

<p class="p2">However, the Bitcoin price had begun to pick up right after the Grayscale outflows slowed down, giving demand enough time to catch up with supply. Just like before, the outflows are being led by Grayscale and until the outflows slow down, BTC could continue to decline.</p>
<p class="p2">A turn in the tide from here, nevertheless, would give Bitcoin a lot of runway. A similar surge, as recorded after the outflows ended in January, would easily put the price past $75,000, which would be a new all-time high for cryptocurrency.</p>
<p class="p2">For now, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-pre-halving-btc-rally-us-fed-decision/">BTC</a> is trading at a $67,320, with a 5.51% increase in the last 24 hours.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Traders Capitulate: Here’s What Happened Last 2 Times</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-traders-capitulate-what-last-2-times/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-traders-capitulate-what-last-2-times/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />最近的链上数据显示比特币投资者最近一直在抛售，暴露市场上的恐慌情绪。比特币持有者总数最近出现了下降，表明有些投资者已经完全抛售他们的持仓。然而，历史数据表明，在类似的抛售事件发生后，比特币的价格有望出现正回报。比特币价格自$60,600低点开始了快速的复苏，目前价格已经上涨到$66,800水平。 <div>
<p>On-chain data shows the Bitcoin investors have been capitulating recently, a sign that FUD has been gripping the market.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Total Amount Of Holders Has Seen A Drop Recently</h2>
<p>According to data from the on-chain analytics firm <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1770675644030169307" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Santiment</a>, the Bitcoin Total Amount of Holders has registered a notable decline recently. The &#8220;<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-capitulation-holders-flee-btc-post-etf-hits/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Total Amount of Holders</a>&#8221; here is an indicator that measures the total number of addresses on the BTC blockchain that are carrying some non-zero balance right now.</p>
<p>When the value of this metric trends up, it can mean that fresh hands are potentially investing into the cryptocurrency, opening new addresses and adding coins to them.</p>

<p>The indicator would naturally also increase if any investors who had left the asset before are returning back to it and filling up their wallets again. Another possible reason for the trend can also be due to holders breaking up their holdings into multiple wallets, for purposes like privacy.</p>
<p>In general, though, an increase in the Total Amount of Holders is usually a sign that net <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-demand-doge-adoption-accelerating/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">adoption</a> of the coin is taking place, which can be a bullish sign in the long term.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a decline in the indicator can signal that some investors have decided to leave the cryptocurrency behind, as they have completely liquidated their holdings.</p>
<p>Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Total Amount of Holders over the past few months:</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Total Amount of Holders" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="1754" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GJKv2EMbAAAHLKb?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096" width="2649" /></p>

<p>As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Total Amount of Holders has suffered a decrease during the past 10 days or so. In all, 311,000 addresses have completely emptied themselves inside this window.</p>
<p>&#8220;To a novice trader, this may appear to be a concern with less overall active participants. However, historically this stat has reflected FUD moments in the market, indicating small BTC wallets are typically capitulating as large wallets scoop up their coins,&#8221; explains Santiment.</p>
<p>From the chart, it&#8217;s visible that there have also been two other instances of mass <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/xrp-traders-show-capitulation-why-could-bullish/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">capitulation</a> within the past few months. More specifically, 1.1 million addresses exited between the 23rd of September and 23rd of October, while 757,000 capitulated between the 21st of January and 13th of February.</p>
<p>Interestingly, during these capitulation events, the price went up 28% and 24%, respectively. So far since the latest selloff from the small hands has started, the cryptocurrency is down about 3%.</p>

<p>&#8220;If history is any indication, Bitcoin has a strong chance of putting up positive returns before this exodus of non-0 wallets this round (due to traders thinking the top is in) finally stops,&#8221; notes the analytics firm.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>Since Bitcoin&#8217;s low at $60,600, the asset has enjoyed some sharp recovery as its price has now surged to the $66,800 level.</p>

<title>Fantom (FTM) Bull Run: Can FTM Hit $2 After 20% Price Spike?</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/fantom-ftm-bull-run-can-ftm-hit-2-after-20-price-spike/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/fantom-ftm-bull-run-can-ftm-hit-2-after-20-price-spike/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章介绍了Fantom（FTM）加密货币的最新动向，包括其市值、交易量和价格走势。最近，Fantom宣布将验证程序的最低质押要求从50万FTM降至5万FTM，以鼓励生态系统的参与。社交兴趣增加，暗示价格涨势可能启动。分析表明Fantom的价格可能在2024年涨至$1.3951，预计价格有中等增长。 <div>
<p>Fantom (FTM), a cryptocurrency known for its high-speed smart contract platform, has been making headlines recently with its price movements and market predictions. </p>
<p>As of the latest data, Fantom is ranked #43 by market cap at $2.9 billion, with a trading volume of $863 million in the last 24 hours.<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/fantom/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> The current value of Fantom</a> stands at $1.06, reflecting an increase of 6.5% in the last 24 hours.</p>

<h2 class="text-lg mt-6 mb-2 first:mt-3"><strong>Recent Developments</strong></h2>
<p>Just recently, Fantom announced a significant reduction in the minimum staking requirements for validators from 500,000 FTM to 50,000 FTM. This move aimed to enhance participation and engagement within the Fantom ecosystem. </p>
<p>Despite facing challenges like a sell-off of assets and a hacking incident in 2023, Fantom managed to recover and close the year with a notable 130% increase in value.</p>
<h2 class="text-lg mt-6 mb-2 first:mt-3"><strong>Fantom: Social Interest Up</strong></h2>
<p>The increase in Fantom&#8217;s social volume indicated that the price surge had caused the cryptocurrency market to start talking about it. As the token&#8217;s weighted sentiment surged, so did bullish emotion surrounding it.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-598958" height="410" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_a77217.png?resize=1024%2C410" width="1024" /></p>



<p>Fantom&#8217;s network activity remained high as the token&#8217;s price gained positive momentum. According to NewsBTC&#8217;s examination of Artemis data, there were comparatively more daily active addresses on the blockchain last month.</p>
<strong>Bull Run Speculation</strong>
<p>Recent reports suggest that Fantom is gearing up for a potential bull run, fueled by the overall positive sentiment in the cryptocurrency market and the increasing demand for altcoins. </p>
<p>The price trend of Fantom indicates preparations for a bullish phase, aligning with the broader market movements that have seen Bitcoin surpassing the $70,000 mark. The anticipation of a bull run is further supported by a <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/community/articles/65fbcb91c763624f6b612fe8/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">120% rally in Fantom&#8217;s price in the last month</a>, hinting at a strong upward momentum.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/JEBsuBDF/" width="1835" /></p>

<strong>Price Outlook</strong>
<p>While the possibility of a bull run is on the horizon, the question of whether Fantom can hit $2 after a 20% price surge remains speculative. The current trajectory of Fantom&#8217;s price movement suggests a potential for growth, but reaching the $2 mark would require sustained positive market conditions and increased investor confidence. </p>
<p>Achieving such a milestone would signify a significant milestone for Fantom and could attract further attention to its platform and ecosystem.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an analytical forecast provided by Anton Kharitonov, a Traders Union analyst, suggests a <a href="https://tradersunion.com/currencies/forecast/fantom/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">relatively optimistic outlook</a> for the price of Fantom (FTM) by the end of 2024.</p>

<p>Kharitonov anticipates FTM reaching $1.3951. However, it&#8217;s important to note that this forecast is not isolated, as it aligns with the expectations of other TU analysts, who project a range of $1.2556 to $1.5346 for FTM&#8217;s price by the end of the same year.</p>

<p>This analysis indicates a consensus among TU analysts that Fantom&#8217;s price will likely experience moderate growth throughout 2024. The range provided reflects the inherent uncertainty in predicting cryptocurrency prices, considering the volatile nature of the market and the multitude of factors that can influence price movements.</p>

<title>Why Is Bitcoin Price Up Today? Key Reasons Explained</title>

<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/why-is-bitcoin-price-up-today-key-reasons-explained/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章指出，在过去24小时内，比特币价格出现了显著的反弹，涨幅达到了10%，从每日最低的$60,805上涨到$68,250。这一价格波动的重要因素包括昨天的美联储公开市场委员会（FOMC）会议、Coinbase Premium的显著变化以及比特币从下降通道中突破的技术走势。FOMC会议上鲍威尔的鸽派言论激发了乐观情绪，Coinbase Premium从负数转为正数表明现货比特币ETF需求增加，比特币价格突破下降通道也引起交易者和分析师的关注。当前比特币价格为$67,397。 <div>
<p>Within the last 24 hours, the market witnessed a significant rally in the Bitcoin price, which soared by 10% from a daily low of $60,805 to a peak of $68,250. This remarkable price movement can be attributed to several key factors, including yesterday’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, a notable change in the Coinbase Premium, and Bitcoin&#8217;s technical breakout from a downtrend channel.</p>
<h2>#1 FOMC Meeting: Dovish Remarks By Jerome Powell Fuel Optimism</h2>
<p>As <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/fomc-preview-bitcoin-crypto-fed-rate-move/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">reported yesterday</a>, the macro environment came back into focus for Bitcoin and crypto following the hotter than expected Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) inflation data in the US. Investors seemed to have de-risked their positions prior to the FOMC event. However, investors got a favorable outcome.</p>
<p>The pivot point for Bitcoin&#8217;s rally can be traced back to the Federal Reserve&#8217;s latest FOMC meeting, where Chairman Jerome Powell delivered a speech that the market interpreted as dovish. The Fed&#8217;s stance, especially in light of recent inflation data, has reassured investors.</p>

<p>Crypto analyst Furkan Yildirim <a href="https://twitter.com/FurkanCCTV/status/1770512293488451628" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">provided</a> a summary of the FOMC&#8217;s key points: &#8220;The ‘Dot Plot’ projections show that the median official expects three quarter-percent cuts in 2024 [&#8230;] The FOMC voted unanimously to leave the federal funds rate unchanged [&#8230;] The median forecast for PCE inflation remains unchanged at 2.4% for 2024 [&#8230;] Officials have also raised forecasts for where they see interest rates in the long term.&#8221;</p>
<p>The reaction to these announcements was immediately bullish in the traditional finance markets as well as Bitcoin and crypto. QCP Capital, a Singapore-based crypto asset trading firm, <a href="https://t.me/QCPbroadcast/1170" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">highlighted</a> the dovish nature of the FOMC&#8217;s stance: &#8220;1. In Powell&#8217;s press conference speech, he was not concerned about the high inflation numbers in Jan and Feb. 2. In the dot plot, more members shifted their projection to 3 cuts in 2024 (9 members vs 6 in Dec).&#8221;</p>
<p>Analyst Ted (@tedtalksmacro) further <a href="https://twitter.com/tedtalksmacro/status/1770525419802186083" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">emphasized</a> the positive implications: &#8220;FOMC summary: &#8211; 3x rate cuts happening this year despite inflation remaining above 2% (Fed expects core PCE at 2.6%). Growth outlook upgraded. Send it.&#8221;</p>
#2 Coinbase Premium Turns Green: A Sign Of Spot ETF Demand
<p>The Coinbase Premium&#8217;s shift to positive territory can be identified as another critical factor influencing Bitcoin&#8217;s price movement. While yesterday&#8217;s <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-etfs-see-record-1-billion-inflows/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">ETF flows</a> were negative again for the third day in a row, the Bitcoin <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-coinbase-premium-negative-price-recovery/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Coinbase Premium</a> was a glimmer of hope that spot Bitcoin ETFs will further fuel price.</p>
<p>CryptoQuant analyst Maartunn remarked: “Coinbase Premium is positive again. It&#8217;s around +$50. Beautiful.” The Coinbase Premium is crucial for BTC price in recent months as it reflects the demand from spot Bitcoin ETFs before the actual numbers are released one day later. Coinbase <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/coinbase/coinbase-custody-accounts-for-90-of-all-bitcoin-etfs-details/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">custodies eight of 11</a> spot Bitcoin ETFs or about 90% of the Bitcoin ETF assets as a result. Thus, Coinbase premium is crucial for a continued rally.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p></p>
<p>GBTC had $386.6 million worth of outflows yesterday. Notably, Blackrock only had $49.3 million of inflows, Fidelity had $12.9 million. This was one of the weakest inflow days for the leading Bitcoin ETFs so far &#8211; a huge disappointment.</p>

<p>But renowned crypto analyst WhalePanda remarked: “We pumped after the FOMC and overall it was better than what boomers expected. Price is now dumping on the news of negative flows but I think they&#8217;ll be in for a nice surprise tomorrow.&#8221;</p>

<p></p>
#3 BTC Price Breaks Out Of Downtrend Channel
<p>On the technical front, Bitcoin&#8217;s breakout from a parallel downtrend channel has caught the attention of traders and analysts alike. Daan Crypto Trades highlighted the importance of this movement on X (formerly Twitter): “Bitcoin tested its 4H 200MA/EMA and has been holding nicely there and broke out. Still watching this channel which will dictate BTC&#8217;s next move.”</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">#Bitcoin</a> Tested its 4H 200MA/EMA and has been holding nicely there and broke out.</p>
<p>Still watching this channel which will dictate <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">$BTC</a>'s next move.</p>
<p>Bulls would want to see this consolidate above and not fall back into the channel. <a href="https://t.co/94etUo6YAR" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/94etUo6YAR</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Daan Crypto Trades (@DaanCrypto) <a href="https://twitter.com/DaanCrypto/status/1770549220526768540?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">March 20, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>The chart shared by Daan shows that BTC price has been consolidating in a parallel downtrend channel for more than a week. Yesterday’s surge catapulted the price above the channel. Currently a retest is taking place. If this is successful, the BTC price could rally further north.</p>
<p>At press time, BTC traded at $67,397.</p>

<title>Leading The Pack: Solana Captures Nearly 50% Of Global Crypto Attention</title>

<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/leading-the-pack-solana-captures-nearly-50-of-global-crypto-attention/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br /> Solana生态系统成为今年最受欢迎的区块链生态系统之一，吸引了全球近一半的加密货币投资者。Solana的本土模因代币和重要的生态项目代币取得了出色表现，显示出对网络的信心。Solana的TVL在过去两年达到最高点，交易量和交易费用也大幅增长。与此同时，以太坊仍是今年第二大流行的区块链生态系统，吸引了约13%的投资者兴趣。 <div>
<p>The Solana ecosystem has achieved a significant milestone by becoming the most popular blockchain ecosystem of the year. This is due to its ability to capture nearly half of the world&#8217;s crypto investor interest in the chain-specific theater.</p>
<p>Together with the outstanding performance of native meme coins like dogwifhat and important ecosystem project tokens like Pyth, Solana&#8217;s comeback to 2021 peaks, indicating a revived faith in the network.</p>



<h2><strong>Solana&#8217;s Dominance: Coingecko Study Insights</strong></h2>
<p>According to a study by Coingecko, as a result of<a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Solana?volume=true&amp;tvl=false&amp;currency=USD" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> Solana&#8217;s nearly 50% share of global chain-specific interest,</a> and its affiliated projects&#8217; increasing popularity and performance, the ecosystem has a significant mindshare that reinforces its leadership in the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-598943" height="758" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_57662c.png?resize=671%2C758" width="671" /></p>
<p>Currently priced at $191, Solana (SOL) has increased by 13% in value over the past 24 hours. The fifth-ranked cryptocurrency has a market capitalization of nearly $85 billion, and its 24-hour trading volume amounted to $9 billion.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/vE3EI3kS/" width="1835" /></p>

<p>The popularity of Solana&#8217;s meme coins and ecosystem initiatives are successful in attracting attention to the network&#8217;s lively and dynamic ecosystem. As long as Solana is drawing attention and capital, its ecosystem will continue to dominate the cryptocurrency investor scene, paving the way for network expansion and innovation.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Ethereum,</a> on the other hand, is the second most popular blockchain ecosystem this year, having garnered nearly 13% of investor interest. Ethereum is probably not a new, hot crypto narrative anymore as its ecosystem and investors are already familiar with it. The Ethereum ecosystem is also seeing its focus spread out among the layer 2 ecosystems that are developing on top of it.</p>

<h2><strong>Factors Driving Solana&#8217;s TVL Increase</strong></h2>
<p>Meanwhile, according to DefiLlama&#8217;s data, the Solana blockchain has demonstrated a remarkable performance, with its decentralized finance (DeFi)<a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Solana?volume=true&amp;tvl=false&amp;currency=USD" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> total value locked (TVL) rising by nearly 80%</a> in the previous month alone.</p>
<p>Related Reading: <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/defi-turmoil-over-5-million-wiped-out-in-liquidations-amid-ethereum-price-drop/"> DeFi Turmoil: Over $5 Million Wiped Out In Liquidations Amid Ethereum Price Drop</a></p>
<p>This incredible ascent represented a significant turning point for the network, with the Solana TVL reaching its highest point in the previous two years. According to the most recent report, Solana is among the top five with the fastest-rising TVL in DeFi, with nearly $4 billion.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-598946" height="304" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_bf6411.png?resize=1024%2C304" width="1024" /></p>

<p>Much of Solana&#8217;s TVL is based on the increase in trade volume, which is tracked by the Defi protocols and operates across its Layer 1 (L1) network.</p>
<p>Just this past month, there was a 125% increase in the daily trading volume of these protocols; the level of trading reached a peak of nearly $3.7 billion.</p>
<p>Additionally, the network achieved an all-time high of $1.6 million in total daily fees, with fee income of $3.61 million.</p>

<title>Dogecoin Price Holds Crucial Support But Can DOGE Clear This Hurdle?</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/doge/dogecoin-price-support-0-1220/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/doge/dogecoin-price-support-0-1220/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br /> Dogecoin兑美元的价格在$0.1220附近获得支撑后正在回升。价格目前低于$0.1650关键阻力和100小时简单移动平均线。然而，价格突破$0.1600和$0.1650阻力水平可能会推动价格向$0.200迈进。MACD和RSI指标显示了积极的趋势。支撑水平分别位于$0.1450、$0.130和$0.1150，而阻力水平分别位于$0.1580、$0.160和$0.1650。 <div>
<p><em>Dogecoin is recovering higher from $0.1220 against the US Dollar. DOGE must clear the $0.1650 resistance to start another increase toward $0.200.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>DOGE declined heavily and tested the $0.1220 support against the US dollar.</li>
<li>The price is trading below the $0.1650 level and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $0.1310 on the 4-hour chart of the DOGE/USD pair (data source from Kraken).</li>
<li>The price could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $0.1600 and $0.1650 resistance levels.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Dogecoin Price Recovers Over 15%</h2>
<p>After a strong decline, Dogecoin price found support near the $0.1220 zone. A low was formed at $0.1228 and DOGE recently started a decent recovery wave, like <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-jumps-68k/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin</a> and <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-rallies-3550/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ethereum</a>.</p>
<p>There was a steady increase above the $0.1320 and $0.1350 resistance levels. The price cleared the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.1927 swing high to the $0.1228 low. There was also a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $0.1310 on the 4-hour chart of the DOGE/USD pair.</p>
<p>Dogecoin is still trading below the $0.160 level and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). On the upside, the price is facing resistance near the $0.1580 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.1927 swing high to the $0.1228 low.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Doegcoin-DOGE_ec0472.png?resize=1024%2C461"><img alt="Dogecoin Price" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-598938" height="461" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Doegcoin-DOGE_ec0472.png?resize=1024%2C461" width="1024" /></a></p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/DOGEUSD/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">DOGEUSD on TradingView.com</a></p>
<p>The next major resistance is near the $0.1650 level. A close above the $0.1650 resistance might send the price toward the $0.1850 resistance. The next major resistance is near $0.200. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.220 level.</p>
<h2>Another Decline in DOGE?</h2>
<p>If DOGE’s price fails to gain pace above the $0.160 level, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.1450 level.</p>
<p>The next major support is near the $0.130 level. If there is a downside break below the $0.130 support, the price could decline further. In the stated case, the price might decline toward the $0.1150 level.</p>

<p>4 Hours MACD – The MACD for DOGE/USD is now gaining momentum in the bullish zone.</p>
<p>4 Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for DOGE/USD is now above the 50 level.</p>

<p>A low was formed at $3,059 and the price is moving higher. There was a strong recovery wave above the $3,350 resistance. The price cleared the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $3,675 swing high to the $3,059 low.</p>
<p>There was also a break above a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-bears-aim-3000/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">major bearish trend line</a> with resistance at $3,400 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD. Ethereum price is now trading above $3,400 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.</p>
<p>On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $3,520 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $3,675 swing high to the $3,059 low. The first major resistance is near the $3,550 level. The next key resistance sits at $3,675, above which the price might gain bullish momentum.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Ethereum_b35294.png?resize=1024%2C461"><img alt="Ethereum Price" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-598935" height="461" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Ethereum_b35294.png?resize=1024%2C461" width="1024" /></a></p>

<p>In the stated case, Ether could rally toward the $3,820 level. If there is a move above the $3,820 resistance, Ethereum could even rise toward the $4,000 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of $4,080.</p>
<h2>Another Decline In ETH?</h2>
<p>If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,550 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,380 level.</p>
<p>The first major support is near the $3,320 zone. The next key support could be the $3,220 zone. A clear move below the $3,220 support might send the price toward $3,150. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,050 level.</p>
<p>Technical Indicators</p>
<p>Hourly MACD<strong> – </strong>The MACD for ETH/USD is losing momentum in the bullish zone.</p>
<p>Hourly RSI<strong> &#8211; </strong>The RSI for ETH/USD is now above the 50 level.</p>

<title>Cardano (ADA) Eyes Explosive 2000% Bull Run, Targeting $12 And Quadrupling ATH</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano/cardano-ada-eyes-explosive-2000-bull-run-targeting-12-and-quadrupling-ath/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano/cardano-ada-eyes-explosive-2000-bull-run-targeting-12-and-quadrupling-ath/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章指出，虽然Cardano (ADA)在最近的加密市场下行趋势中遇到了挑战，但有迹象表明潜在的上行动力正在建立。分析师指出，ADA的市场走势从熊市转为牛市，表明可能开始一次重要的牛市。如果ADA再次经历类似于2021年4月的牛市，可能会超过1美元，并潜在达到12.6美元的目标。此外，Cardano的关键指标显示出强劲的增长，包括市值、交易量和手续费。ADA目前的价格为0.603美元。 <div>
<p>Cardano (ADA), currently positioned as the 9th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has encountered a downward trend following the prevailing bearish sentiment in the crypto market. <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/breaking-news-ticker/breaking-bitcoin-hits-new-all-time-high-surging-past-70000-for-the-first-time-in-history/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin </a>(BTC), the market leader, has led the way in price corrections for top cryptocurrencies. </p>
<p>Despite ADA&#8217;s recent retracement of nearly 20% in the past week after reaching a 22-month high of $0.810 on March 14, there are indications that a potential <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/ada/ada-price-prediction-0-75/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">trend reversal</a> is on the horizon. This shift in momentum could potentially drive ADA towards reclaiming the $1 mark, which it hasn&#8217;t reached since April 2022.</p>
<h2>Bullish Momentum Building For ADA</h2>
<p>Crypto analyst &#8220;Trend Rider,&#8221; who shares his insights on the social media platform X (formerly Twitter), has highlighted ADA&#8217;s market shift from bearish to bullish trends. Looking at the two-week chart, key moving averages are realigning, signaling a transition to a bullish framework as indicators move from red to green. </p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/TrendRidersTR/status/1770441959020093907?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">According </a>to the analyst, this pattern is similar to a previous occurrence observed just before ADA embarked on a significant bull run. </p>

<img alt="Cardano " class="size-large wp-image-598926" height="484" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GJHex2WWMAAtvtp.jpeg?w=860&#038;resize=860%2C484" width="860" />
<p>If history repeats itself and mirrors the April 2021 bull run, where ADA rose from $0.133 to its current all-time high (ATH) of $3.168 in less than a year, posting gains of over 2000%, a similar uptrend could easily take ADA past the $1 mark. </p>
<p>If another 2000% price surge materializes, it could push Cardano&#8217;s native token to reach the $12.6 level, marking a significant quadrupling of its <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano/cardano-breakout-network/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">all-time high </a>milestone.</p>
<p>While the market correction continues, Trend Rider has <a href="https://x.com/TrendRidersTR/status/1770102612567691274?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">identified </a>crucial support lines that must be held back to maintain the bullish structure. According to the analyst, the trend support for ADA is anticipated to range between $0.45 and $0.52. </p>
<h2>Key Cardano Metrics Soar</h2>
<p>Cardano has shown significant progress in key metrics, as indicated by data from Token Terminal. The figures reflect a significant increase in market capitalization, trading volume, and fees, highlighting the adoption of the Cardano blockchain ecosystem. </p>
<p>According to Token Terminal <a href="https://tokenterminal.com/terminal/projects/cardano" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">data</a>, Cardano&#8217;s fully diluted market capitalization is approximately $29.80 billion, representing strong growth over the past 30 days. This figure indicates the total value of all ADA tokens, including those not yet in circulation. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the circulating market capitalization, which factors in only the tokens currently available for trading, has also experienced a notable increase, reaching around $23.35 billion. </p>
<img alt="Cardano " class="size-large wp-image-598927" height="451" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot_83.jpg?w=674&#038;resize=674%2C451" width="674" />
<p>Moreover, Cardano has witnessed a significant surge in trading volume over the past 30 days. The<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano/cardano-ada-price-rally-is-far-from-over/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> trading volume</a> has soared to approximately $27.96 billion, reflecting an increase of 117.5%. This surge indicates heightened market activity and a growing demand for ADA tokens.</p>

<p>Another noteworthy aspect revealed by Token Terminal data is the substantial growth in fees generated within the Cardano network. Over the past 30 days, fees have amounted to approximately $506.07k, demonstrating a significant increase of 36.5%. </p>
<p>When annualized, the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano-ada-price-alert-analyst-predicts-60-rally-in-next-7-days/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">fees generated</a> by the Cardano blockchain reach an estimated $6.16 million, reflecting a notable growth rate of 5.2%. This signifies the expanding usage of the Cardano network for various transactions and applications.</p>
<img alt="Cardano " class="size-large" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/MdNVogYV/" width="1815" />
<p>ADA is trading at $0.603, down 2.6% in the last 24 hours. </p>

<title>Solana Whale Makes Massive 1,000,000 SOL Deposit To Binance, Bearish Sign?</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-whale-1000000-sol-binance-bearish/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-whale-1000000-sol-binance-bearish/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。Solana的一个大户将大量SOL转移到币安交易所，可能对资产价格产生不利影响。文章介绍了六笔大额SOL交易，其中一笔价值1亿美元的交易涉及到了币安交易所。这些交易表明有可能大户开始在交易所抛售SOL，这可能会影响市场价格。当前Solana的价格已经下滑至174美元水平。 <div>
<p>On-chain data shows a Solana whale has just moved a massive SOL stack to Binance, which could prove to be bearish for the asset&#8217;s price.</p>
<h2>Solana Whale Has Deposited 1 Million SOL To Binance Today</h2>
<p>According to data from the cryptocurrency transaction tracker service <a href="https://twitter.com/whale_alert" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Whale Alert</a>, several large SOL transactions have occurred on the blockchain during the past day.</p>
<p>More specifically, six massive transfers have been spotted on the network. Out of these, two transactions were gigantic, with tokens worth $362 million and $498 million involved.</p>

<p>These extraordinary transfers, though, were both between unknown wallets. Addresses like these are those unattached to any known centralized exchange, so they are usually the users&#8217; personal, self-custodial wallets.</p>
<p>Due to this, transfers between unknown wallets are generally hard to say anything about. Often, they can be as simple as the investor moving to a fresh wallet, which is naturally of no particular consequence for the wider market.</p>
<p>The other four whale transactions from the past day, however, did involve central entities on one end, so speculation around them can have a bit more ground to stand on.</p>
<p>Out of these four, one transaction in particular stands out. In this move, a whale shifted 1 million SOL on the network, worth more than $166 million at the transfer time. Below are some additional details regarding this transfer.</p>
<p><img alt="Solana Whale Inflow" class="alignnone wp-image-598903 size-large aligncenter" height="483" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/details.png?w=860&#038;resize=860%2C483" width="860" /></p>

<p>As is visible, the receiver in the case of this transaction was a wallet affiliated with the cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/94-million-xrp-exits-binance/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Binance</a>, implying that the whale transferred coins from their address to the platform.</p>
<p>Such transactions are known as <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-whales-exchange-inflow-bad-sign-price/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">exchange inflows</a>. Users make these transfers when they want to use one of the exchange services, which can include selling.</p>
<p>As such, exchange inflows may sometimes be bearish for the cryptocurrency. In particular, massive inflows made by the whales can exert some visible fluctuations on the market.</p>
<p>Just like this huge SOL transfer, the other three transactions mentioned before were also exchange inflows. They were significantly smaller in scale, though, with their average value being $33.2 million.</p>
<p>Two of these transactions also went to Binance, while the third (and the latest) headed to <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-ascent-to-64000-causes-coinbase-to-crash-heres-what-happened/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Coinbase</a>. Interestingly, the address pairs in these two Binance transfers were the same, hinting that the same whale may have been responsible for them.</p>
<p>With the four exchange inflows, Solana, worth $265.6 million, has now found its way to exchanges. This is clearly a notable amount, so it may impact the asset&#8217;s price.</p>

<p>There is no guarantee, however, that any of the whales involved made these transactions for selling; it&#8217;s possible that they made the moves for some other purpose that&#8217;s not directly relevant to the market.</p>
<p>Although Solana has been sliding off over the past few days, the possibility of these whales deciding to exit certainly exists.</p>
<h2>SOL Price</h2>
<p>Following the recent drawdown Solana has seen, the asset&#8217;s price has come down to the $174 level.</p>

<title>Celsius Fights To Reclaim $2 Billion Withdrawn Prior To Bankruptcy Declaration</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/celsius/celsius-fights-to-reclaim-2-billion-withdrawn-prior-to-bankruptcy-declaration/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/celsius/celsius-fights-to-reclaim-2-billion-withdrawn-prior-to-bankruptcy-declaration/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的<br />根据彭博的报告，Celsius Network要求在2022年7月破产申请之前集体提取了超过20亿美元的主要客户将这些资金返还，以免潜在诉讼。破产委员会已开始联系在公司破产申请前90天内提取100,000美元以上的客户。委员会提供了和解选项，根据客户在2022年提取时的资产价值来确定可能的金额。客户可以选择和解以免遭受潜在诉讼的法律后果。目前，Celsius Network的主网币CEL正在交易中表现不佳。 <div>
<p>According to a Bloomberg report, Celsius Network, the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-bloodbath-celsius-eth/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">crypto platform</a> that filed for bankruptcy in July 2022, demands that major customers who collectively withdrew over $2 billion before the bankruptcy return those funds to avoid potential litigation. </p>
<p>An oversight committee formed during Celsius&#8217;s Chapter 11 case has begun contacting customers who withdrew more than $100,000 during the period leading up to the company&#8217;s bankruptcy filing. This recovery effort aims to repay creditors <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/celsius-seeks-repayment-creditors-urged-to-return-27-5-of-funds/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">who did not withdraw</a> funds from Celsius. </p>
<h2>Settlement Offered To Celsius Users </h2>
<p>Per the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-20/celsius-seeks-return-of-2-billion-withdrawn-before-bankruptcy" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, the oversight committee&#8217;s recovery process will impact around 2% of Celsius users who, in total, withdrew approximately 40% of the platform&#8217;s assets within the 90 days preceding the Chapter 11 filing. </p>
<p>Celsius reported $6 billion in assets, 1.7 million registered users, and 300,000 active users with account balances exceeding $100 at the time of bankruptcy. </p>

<p>Notably, the oversight committee has offered customers who may face clawback suits a settlement option, providing them with a “favorable rate” if they choose to settle. </p>
<p>Customers who opt for settlement would have their potential <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/celsius-dump-triggers-ethereum-dive-35-million-sell-off-sends-eth-price-crashing/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">liabilities </a>determined based on the value of their assets at the time of their 2022 withdrawals. This means that settling customers would retain any appreciation in the value of their digital assets resulting from the surge in crypto prices over the past year.</p>
<h2>Legal Consequences If Settlement Offer Is Declined</h2>
<p>According to Bloomberg, customers who decline to settle may be subject to significantly more liability through potential litigation. The committee&#8217;s letter warns customers about the potential consequences of not accepting the settlement offer.</p>
<p>In November, a bankruptcy judge approved Celsius&#8217; plan to distribute billions of dollars in assets and transform into a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/celsius-bitcoin-mining-plan-on-creditor-vote/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">creditor-owned Bitcoin mining firm</a>. According to a court filing by the company&#8217;s lawyers, Celsius has already distributed around $2 billion in assets.</p>

<p>Overall, Celsius Network&#8217;s oversight committee is pursuing the recovery of over $2 billion in withdrawals made by major customers shortly before the company filed for <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-faces-market-tremors-as-celsius-offloads-1-billion-in-eth/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">bankruptcy</a>. By offering settlement options based on the value of assets at the time of withdrawal, Celsius aims to alleviate potential litigation and expedite the repayment of creditors. </p>
<p>As the process unfolds, impacted customers decide to settle potential liabilities or face potential litigation with potentially higher consequences.</p>
<img alt="Celsius" class="size-large" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/eDbS48ev/" width="1815" />
<p>Currently, the network&#8217;s native token, CEL, is trading at $0.1862, reflecting a significant year-to-date decline of over 49%.</p>
<p>In shorter time frames, the token has experienced a 12% decline in the last 24 hours, a 32% decline in the last week, and a 27% decline in the last fourteen days, highlighting the limited interest and lack of confidence among investors in the CEL token.</p>

<title>Hold Your Horses: ‘Buying The Crypto Dip Is Still Too Early’ Warns Top Analyst — Here’s Why</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。文章指出了10x Research首席分析师Markus Thielen对比特币和以太坊的悲观展望。Thielen认为市场尚未触底，建议不要过早购买。他警告称，比特币的关键支撑水平为63,000美元和60,000美元，破位60,000美元可能会导致跌至52,000美元到54,000美元的区间。尽管短期看涨信号不明显，Thielen对比特币未来可能的变化持乐观态度，预计一年内可能会攀升至超过100,000美元。同时，市场涨跌受美联储即将公布的决定影响，加剧了加密市场的不确定性和波动性。 <div>
<p>Amid a recent downturn in the broader crypto market, the concept of &#8220;buying the dip&#8221; has once again surfaced, tempting traders and investors with the prospect of snagging assets at lower prices. However, <a href="https://mail.10xresearch.co/p/bitcoin-turned-bearish-10-days-ago" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">caution</a> is the watchword from Markus Thielen, CEO of 10x Research, a top analyst in the crypto space.</p>
<p>Thielen&#8217;s latest advisories suggest that the current market conditions may not yet be ripe for the optimistic strategy of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/profit-taking-panic-short-term-bitcoin-holders/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">dip purchasing</a>.</p>

<h2>The Basis Of Bearish Sentiment</h2>
<p>Thielen&#8217;s recent analysis, released earlier today, underscores a bearish outlook on <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/high-stakes-week-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum-as-central-bank-decisions-approach-key-predictions/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">flagship cryptocurrencies</a> Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), advising that it may be premature to buy the dip.</p>
<p>This guidance is rooted in a comprehensive approach to <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/planbs-bitcoin-forecast-a-journey-to-5-million/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">market analysis</a>, combining analog models, data-driven predictive models, and objective analysis.</p>
<img alt="Bitcoin Analog Model. " height="358" src="https://i0.wp.com/media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/10248879-4abc-4bd1-930a-56628283e2dc/image.png?resize=642%2C358&#038;ssl=1" width="642" />
<p>At the heart of Thielen&#8217;s cautionary stance is a detailed report outlining the factors contributing to the firm, 10x Research&#8217; bearish outlook on Bitcoin and Ethereum.</p>
<p>Despite a seemingly attractive price point for these cryptocurrencies, Thielen believes the market has not yet bottomed out, suggesting further declines before any significant rally.</p>
<p>The report pinpoints $63,000 and $60,000 as critical support levels for Bitcoin. A breach below $60,000, Thielen warns, could precipitate a fall into the $52,000-$54,000 range.</p>
<p>Yet, despite these short-term bearish indicators, Thielen <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-might-be-poised-for-a-double-pump/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">remains optimistic</a> about Bitcoin&#8217;s potential, envisioning a climb to heights of over $100,000 within the year. Thielen noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>Buying this dip is still too early. Technically, we still expect Bitcoin to trade below 60,000 before a more meaningful rally attempt is started. Based on the previous new high signals, we could paint a rosy picture of 83,000 and 102,000 upside targets, but for the time being, we are more focused on managing the downside.</p></blockquote>
<h2>The Crypto Market&#8217;s Critical Juncture</h2>
<p>The current state of the crypto market reflects a tense anticipation of the upcoming central bank announcements from the US Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>This decision is expected to significantly influence monetary policy and, by extension, the cryptocurrency market. Particularly, <a href="https://medium.com/@BloFin_Official/blofin-whales-view-week-11-2024-2f4ecc640093" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">insights</a> from crypto futures exchange Blofin suggest that the outcome of this announcement could sway market sentiment substantially.</p>
<img alt="Bitcoin (BTC) price chart on TradingView amid crypto news" height="1496" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/xASyEjNI/" width="2770" />
<p>Meanwhile, the market reacts in real-time, with Bitcoin slightly increasing 2.4% in the past 24 hours but still showing a notable decline over the past week. Adding to the complexity of the market dynamics are observations from Alex Krüger, a respected figure in macroeconomics and cryptoanalysis.</p>

<p>Krüger attributes the recent <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crash-60800-worst-over-experts/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">price collapse to several factors</a>, including market over-leverage, the negative sentiment ripple from Ethereum, and speculative fervor around certain altcoins. These elements combine to paint a picture of a market at a crossroads, with significant volatility and uncertainty ahead.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Reasons for the crash, in order of importance</p>
<p>(for those who need them)</p>
<p>#1 Too much leverage (funding matters)
#2 ETH driving market south (market decided ETF not passing)
#3 Negative BTC ETF inflows (careful, data is T+1)
#4 Solana shitcoin mania (it went too far)</p>

<title>Trezor X Account Hacked: How Much Was Taken In The Fake Crypto Presale?</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/trezor-x-account-hacked-how-much-was-taken-in-the-fake-crypto-presale/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/trezor-x-account-hacked-how-much-was-taken-in-the-fake-crypto-presale/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。Trezor的X账户被黑客攻击，用于推广虚假加密货币代币销售。社区成员快速发现可疑活动，并警告其他用户。黑客窃取了8100美元，但社区的快速反应避免了更大的损失。Trezer表示继续调查此事件，并呼吁用户保持警惕。 <div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In the late hours of Tuesday, Trezor’s X account was compromised. The hacker used the hardware wallet company account to promote a fake crypto presale with a malicious link attached.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Members of the crypto community quickly realized the suspicious activity from the company and alerted other X users about the scam. Since then, Trezor’s team has regained control of the account.</p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto Community’s Solidarity, Hackers’ New Prey</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In the now-deleted tweets, the hacker announced that Trezor was “willing to support the $SLERF Community.” Taking advantage of the ongoing efforts from crypto projects and exchanges to raise funds for the affected participants of the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana-memecoin-presale-gone-wrong-creator-accidentally-burns-10m-whale-makes-huge-profit/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Slerf presale debacle</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Community alert: Trezor X/Twitter account is currently compromised <a href="https://t.co/hNm2OUjEgE" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/hNm2OUjEgE</a></p>
<p>&mdash; ZachXBT (@zachxbt) <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1770225097552363795?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">March 19, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The unauthorized post offered the presale of a fake $TRZR token, which required interested users to send SOL to the hacker’s address. Additionally, Trezor supporters would receive a “separate bonus airdrop” if they went to a website linked in the post.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As it’s customary for phishing scams, the link would redirect to a wallet drainer that takes control of the person’s wallet after they try to “claim the airdrop tokens.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The crypto community shared their thoughts on the hack. A user <a href="https://x.com/i_am_wilf/status/1770411148271128913?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">pointed out</a> that the security breach was a &#8220;bad look&#8221; for the company as it focuses on crypto security. Others thanked the users who warned about the hack since it potentially saved them and others from falling for it.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It’s worth noting that many users have raised their concerns about the community’s reaction to the Slerf presale drama. They <a href="https://x.com/DeNomics_/status/1770061164829122893?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">consider</a> that raising funds for the participants affected sets a precedent of “bailing out” bad actors and will only “enable” similar behavior.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, scammers have been trying to prey on the community’s good faith to help potential victims and newcomers. As seen with the Trezor hack, the scammer seemingly tried to maximize its gains by utilizing the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/crypto-presale-frenzy-raises-over-122m-worth-of-sol-in-a-week/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">presale meta trend</a> and the Slerf drama.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">“Dumb” Hacker Or Smarter Community?</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Usually, the recounting of crypto hacks ends with staggering figures being stolen, but for once, the tale is different. As <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1770237007366639681" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reported</a> by ZachXBT, the hacker managed to steal $8,100 from the unauthorized post, which includes the 25% drainer fee. As part of the loot, the hacker also received a &#8220;whooping 0.96 Solana,&#8221; as another user <a href="https://twitter.com/Theft/status/1770237549547802922" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">pointed</a> out.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Many wondered if the small amount stolen was due to the community intelligently recognizing the scam or the hacker’s inability to perform a big heist. Whatever the case, this is a remarkable feat as the cold wallet company amasses over 200,000 followers that momentarily became potential victims.</p>

<p></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Despite this small victory for the community, “It’s $8.1K more than 0,” as one user said. This raises the question of whether the hack was possible due to a lack of proper security measures or an inside job taking place.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">No official explanation has been given yet. Nonetheless, Trezor acknowledged the hack in an X post earlier today.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Please remain vigilant and remember, Trezor will NEVER request funds or assets be sent to any address.…</p>

<p></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The company affirmed that the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/algorand/algorand-ceos-x-account-hacked-is-justin-sun-involved/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">hack happened</a> despite its “robust protections,” including two-factor authentication (2FA).

<title>Bitcoin Pre-Halving Dip Expected: Will BTC Rally Before US Fed Decision?</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-pre-halving-btc-rally-us-fed-decision/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-pre-halving-btc-rally-us-fed-decision/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章指出比特币目前处于熊市形态，与2020年减半前的走势相似。在2024年4月的减半事件前，网络准备削减矿工奖励。比特币价格历来在减半前刷新高点后下跌，之后再次攀升至新高。技术指标显示，当前价格向下的趋势较为明显。联邦储备系统将于3月20日公布利率决定，此举可能影响比特币需求及价格变动。 <div>
<p>Bitcoin remains under pressure when writing and is within a bearish formation following sharp losses on March 19. While prices tank, one analyst on X <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/rektcapital/status/1770414124087869842" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">thinks</a> this retracement aligns with historical performance, especially as the network prepares to slash miner rewards in April 2024. </p>
<h2>Bitcoin Retracement Similar To Pre-Halving Cool-Off Of 2020</h2>
<p>Based on the analyst&#8217;s assessment, BTC is currently down roughly 18% from its recent swing high. This retracement is at the same level as the ballpark 19% decline observed before the previous halving event in 2020. </p>
<img alt="Bitcoin pre-halving rally | Source: analyst on X" class="size-full wp-image-598896" height="686" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GJHFw8dWIAAGmR1.jpg?resize=1024%2C686" width="1024" />
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that Bitcoin has historically corrected lower after posting fresh highs before halving. Afterward, the coin rallies to fresh all-time highs following halving, driven by a decrease in supply. In this cycle, BTC soared to a new all-time high of $73,800 in the first two weeks of March before cooling off to spot rate, a deviation from the usual trend.</p>

<p>As the Bitcoin network gears up for the halving event in mid-April 2024, it&#8217;s crucial to note the potential market implications. Some market observers speculate that the current drop could offer entries for investors looking to accumulate at a lower price in anticipation of future price gains. </p>
<p>From the Bitcoin candlestick arrangement in the daily chart, the least resistance path appears southwards. Specifically, following the dip on March 19, the coin remains in a bearish breakout pattern, finding strong rejections from the middle Bollinger Band (BB) or the 20-day moving average. The BB is a technical indicator for gauging volatility.</p>

<h2>Will The Federal Reserve Revive BTC Demand?</h2>
<p>Currently, Bitcoin is steady. Even so, only time will tell whether prices will recover, breaking above the $70,000 level in the days leading up to the halving event in less than a month. Further losses from spot rates mean the dip before halving and after the pre-halving rally was much sharper than in 2020.</p>
<p>As history clearly shows, halving is an important event in Bitcoin. It has repeatedly proven to be a major price catalyst for Bitcoin, as seen in the last bull cycle when prices rose to roughly $70,000. </p>

<p>Accordingly, the coming days will shape how Bitcoin prices evolve in the medium to long term. One key driver of crypto and BTC valuation will be fundamental events, especially pronouncements from the United States Federal Reserve (<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/fomc-preview-bitcoin-crypto-fed-rate-move/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Fed</a>). The central bank will relay its decision on interest rates on March 20. Earlier in 2022, when interest rates were hiked, prices tanked.</p>

<title>Top 3 Solana Meme Coins To Buy Amid The Bitcoin Crash That Could 10x</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/meme-coins/top-3-solana-meme-coins/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/meme-coins/top-3-solana-meme-coins/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />比特币价格暴跌使加密市场陷入困境，但也为某些潜在投资机会提供了可能。本文列出了三种可能将投资组合增长10倍的明智选择的玩梗币。首先是基于Solana的Myro，最近在交易所上市，有望超过10倍增长。其次是Popcat，近期表现不俗，市值为1.67亿美元，有潜力超过1亿美元。最后是Wen（WEN）玩梗币，市值不到2亿美元，预计有可能增长10倍。这些Solana玩梗币在加密市场中展现出巨大潜力。 <div>
<p class="p2">As the Bitcoin price crash has ravaged the crypto market and left altcoins suffering, it has presented a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/meme-coins-market-cap-soar-to-over-54-billion/">unique buying opportunity for meme coins</a> that may never come after this time. So here are the top 3 meme coins that could 10x your portfolio from here.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Solana-Based Myro Leads Meme Coins With Potential</h2>
<p class="p2">Solana-based meme coins have been all the rave over the past year and with good reason as well. These meme coins have done so well in such a short time, coming up to compete with established Ethereum-based meme coins which have been around for years.</p>

<p class="p2">With the likes of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-tokens-among-top-gainers-jup-and-wen-soar-over-12-wif-hits-new-ath/">WIF</a> and <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-avalanche-bonk-pepe/">BONK</a> already crossing the $1 billion market cap market, the hunt is on for other Solana-based meme coins that could achieve this same feat, and that is where the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/god-candle-solana-meme-coin/">Myro token</a> comes in. <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/god-candle-solana-meme-coin/">Myro</a> currently has a $200 million market cap, which makes it a prime candidate for crossing $1 billion. However, its most bullish developments have been its exchange listings.</p>
<p class="p2">Myro scored a Binance perpetual listing last month, which pushed its market cap above $400 million for the first time. It has since retraced, but this retracement is similar to what was seen with WIF, which fell back down to $180 million at a point. If <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/god-candle-solana-meme-coin/">Myro</a> follows the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-tokens-among-top-gainers-jup-and-wen-soar-over-12-wif-hits-new-ath/">WIF</a> playbook, then its next leg up could see it rise more than 5x above the $1 billion mark.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Popcat: Another Solana Meme Coin On The Rise</h2>
<p class="p2">Popcat is another <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana-meme-coin-dogwifhat-wif-hits-new-ath-market-cap-breaks-1-6-billion/">Solana meme coin</a> that has made waves in the space over the past few months. After a long stretch of consolidation, the price had eventually broken out in February to reach a new all-time high price of $0.37 in mid-March.</p>
<p class="p2">The price has since retraced a little over 50% since then and is now back to $0.17 with a market cap of $167 million. As with the majority of other meme coins, the total supply of the token is in circulation, which means there are no more unlocks coming up.</p>
<p class="p2">At the current market cap, reaching the $1 billion mark would be an over 500% increase for the meme coin. And with the bull market coming up, the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-tokens-among-top-gainers-jup-and-wen-soar-over-12-wif-hits-new-ath/">price of Popcat</a> could rally higher, bringing a more than 10x return for investors.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Wen (WEN) Meme Coin</h2>
<p class="p2"><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-tokens-among-top-gainers-jup-and-wen-soar-over-12-wif-hits-new-ath/">Wen (WEN)</a> is another Solana-based meme coin that has hit the crypto space in the last few months. Starting out as an airdrop for users of the Solana-based Jupiter decentralized exchange, it has quickly grown among meme coin investors as one of the more stable investments.</p>

<p class="p2">Just like the other meme coins on this list, the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-tokens-among-top-gainers-jup-and-wen-soar-over-12-wif-hits-new-ath/">WEN token</a> shows a lot of promise because it is still under a $200 million market cap. This puts it at an at least 5x move to $1 billion, with a possible 10x when it reaches the $2 billion market cap mark.</p>

<title>Shiba Inu Sees A Shift: Short Term Holders Take Possession Of 23 Trillion SHIB</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-short-term-holders/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-short-term-holders/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。<br />市场动态导致Shiba Inu (SHIB)在本月初出现价格飙升，但投资者现在似乎正在撤离这种模因加密货币。On-chain数据表明，过去四天里，有超过23万亿SHIB从长期持有者手中流入短期持有者的钱包，这标志着价格可能会进一步下跌至$0.000023水平。技术分析显示SHIB的整体技术指标指向价格下跌，但仍有望在短期内恢复。 <div>
<p>Current market dynamics have seen Shiba Inu (SHIB) <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/behind-the-scenes-of-shiba-inu-12-plunge-what-on-chain-analysis-tells-us/">shedding off a lot of its gains</a> earlier in the month. SHIB kickstarted a price surge on February 29th at $0.00001178 to reach $0.00004456 for the first time since December 2021, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-price-skyrockets-heres-why/">representing a surge</a> of over 278% in the space of three days. </p>
<p>However, it seems investors are now pulling away from the meme cryptocurrency, and the bull frantic earlier in the month seems to be disappearing. Interestingly, on-chain data indicates that a chunk of over 23 trillion SHIB has moved from the hands of long-term holders into the wallets of short-term holders in the past four days. This cohort of addresses is known to hold their SHIB tokens for quick returns instead of holding them long-term.</p>
<h2>Shiba Inu Price Downtrend Expected to Extend Beyond 45%</h2>
<p>SHIB has been on a general downtrend since March 5 with the formation of lower highs in <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-price-soars-10-in-reaction-to-explosive-2367-shib-burn-surge/">cases of brief uptrends</a>. Notably, the crypto has dropped by 46% since attaining this two-year high. At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.000024, down by 4.79% and 27% in the past 24 hours and seven days, respectively.</p>

<p>According to data from IntoTheBlock, Short-term Shiba Inu owners have now increased their possession by 23 trillion SHIB in the past four days, signaling lower prices ahead. According to ITB&#8217;s &#8220;Balance by Time Held&#8221; metric, the balance held by traders holding for less than a month has increased by 385% in the last 30 days. At the same time, long-term holders (more than a year) and cruisers (holding for one to 12 months) have reduced their balance by 9.27% and 11.30%, respectively. </p>
<p><img alt="Shiba Inu" class="wp-image-598842 aligncenter" height="276" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Shiba-Inu.png?w=460&#038;resize=701%2C276" width="701" />This interesting movement demonstrates the current dynamic among the various cohorts of SHIB traders. The decrease in long-term holder balance indicates they might be taking profit after holding for so long. At the same time, so much of the supply is moving into the hands of short-term traders seeking quick profits, making SHIB vulnerable to continued selloffs.</p>
<h2>Technical Analysis: What&#8217;s Next For SHIB’s Price?</h2>
<p>The overall technical indicators for SHIB point to <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-open-interest-40-crash/">short-term correction</a> unless there is a change in <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-whales-shib/">bullish sentiment</a>. The meme token has now broken below support at the $0.000026 price level and is now moving towards $0.000023, a level that has acted as a major resistance earlier in the month.</p>

<p>On the other hand, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-surge-in-interest/" rel="nofollow">several fundamental factors</a> point to a potential price recovery and <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/crypto-analyst-shiba-inu-target/">continued growth</a> for the meme coin. Despite its recent correction, the price of SHIB is still up by 144% in the past 30 days, which shows the uptrend can resume anytime soon. </p>

<title>Santiment Reveals Best Altcoins Currently In “Opportunity Zone”</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/santiment-best-altcoins-opportunity-zone/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/santiment-best-altcoins-opportunity-zone/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> 摘要：<br /><br />这些信息是积极的。Santiment的链上分析显示了一些加密货币进入了中期“机会区”。MVRV指标显示了比特币市值与实现市值之间的比率，为投资者提供了有关投资价值的信息。通过分析MVRV的偏离情况，Santiment提出了“机会与危险区模型”，以确定哪些资产目前提供了卖出或买入的潜在窗口。一些进入中期机会区的潜在优质备选货币包括Lido DAO（LDO），Synthetix（SNX），Storj（STORJ）和OMG Network（OMG）。 <br /><br /> <div>
<p>The on-chain analytics firm Santiment has revealed the altcoins that have recently surged into the mid-term &#8220;opportunity zone.&#8221;</p>
<h2>These Altcoins May Be More Likely To See Rebounds</h2>
<p>In a new <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1770249809280237856" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Santiment has discussed what the various altcoins in the market are looking like from the perspective of the MVRV. The &#8220;<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-mvrv-levels-parabolic-bull-run-2020/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Market Value To Realized Value</a>&#8221; (MVRV) refers to an indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the Bitcoin market cap and the realized cap.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-long-term-holders-own-80-realized-cap/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">realized cap</a> here is a capitalization model for BTC that measures the total sum of capital that the investors have used to purchase their coins. As such, the MVRV tells us about how the value that the investors are holding right now (the market cap) compares against this initial investment.</p>

<p>Historically, the more profits the investors have held (that is, the higher the market cap has been compared to the realized cap), the more likely tops have been to occur. This is naturally because investors become more likely to give in to the allure of profit-taking the higher their gains get.</p>
<p>On the other hand, cryptocurrencies have been probable to see rebounds when holders&#8217; returns have dropped into the negative territory. In these conditions, there aren&#8217;t many profit-takers left, so selling pressure begins to run out.</p>
<p>Based on these facts, Santiment has come up with an &#8220;Opportunity &amp; Danger Zone Model&#8221; that uses the MVRV&#8217;s divergence from the norm on various timeframes to determine if an asset is providing a potential window for selling or buying right now.</p>
<p>Below is the chart shared by the on-chain analytics firm that reveals what this model is saying for altcoins around the sector:</p>
<p><img alt="Altcoins MVRV Ratio" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="1759" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GJEt5K7awAAN654?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096" width="2962" /></p>

<p>From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that a lot of coins are still inside the overbought territory, but several altcoins have managed to sneak into the mid-term opportunity zone following the recent market downturn led by <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crash-60800-worst-over-experts/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin&#8217;s plunge</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;This zone gets breached when an asset&#8217;s 30-day, 90-day, and 365-day average wallet returns are combining to be in negative territory,&#8221; explains Santiment. It should be noted, though, that while mid-term returns are red for these coins, they are still not yet inside the buy zone proper.</p>
<p>&#8220;In a zero sum game like crypto, projects with minimal returns compared to the rest of the sector have a higher probability of a more efficient rebound for those who are willing to #buythedip on projects traders are in the most pain on,&#8221; notes the analytics firm.</p>

<p>According to Santiment, some of the best altcoin candidates who are inside the mid-term opportunity zone include Lido DAO (LDO), Synthetix (SNX), Storj (STORJ), and OMG Network (OMG).</p>
<h2>LDO Price</h2>
<p>Lido DAO has had a bad time recently as its price has gone down more than 31% over the past week. With these red returns, it&#8217;s no wonder that the coin is becoming underbought on the MVRV.</p>

<title>Shiba Inu May Rise 250% Pre-Bitcoin Halving, Predicts SHIB Team</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-rise-250-pre-bitcoin-halving/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-rise-250-pre-bitcoin-halving/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。<br />Shiba Inu生态系统的主要官员预测SHIB代币价值将在接近比特币减半前暴涨250%。尽管SHIB最近下跌了43%，但Shiba Inu团队对代币前景持乐观态度，预测SHIB有望超过其2021年最高点。此外，团队还暗示SHIB有可能在市值上超越Dogecoin，通过计划中的“Secret Wags”策略。团队表示，他们有“#ShibaArmy”、”#Shibarium”和不能透露的战略，认为SHIB有望成为新的热门加密狗。 <div>
<p>In a bold forecast that is stirring considerable attention within the SHIB community, a prominent official from the Shiba Inu ecosystem has projected a staggering 250% surge in the token&#8217;s value leading up to the upcoming Bitcoin halving. Lucie, the marketing lead for Shiba Inu, expressed her confidence in a significant rebound for SHIB, predicting that the meme coin could surpass its 2021 all-time high (ATH) in the weeks ahead.</p>
<p>This optimistic outlook comes despite the token&#8217;s recent 43% decline to $0.000026 from its recent yearly high at $0.000045. Lucie shared her personal investment move on X, revealing her purchase of SHIB during the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-open-interest-40-crash/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">recent dip</a> at around $0.000024, amounting to $989.08.</p>
<p>She dubbed this strategy &#8220;Bought the DIP, my lovely SHIB,&#8221; showcasing her belief in a strong move for the meme coin. With SHIB currently trading at $0.000026, a 70% decrease from its ATH of $0.00008845, the crypto must experience a swift and significant rally of 250% to achieve its previous peak.</p>

<p>This ambitious target is set against the backdrop of the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/when-is-the-next-btc-halving-date-bitcoin-halving-guide/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">upcoming Bitcoin halving</a>, expected to occur in 22 to 31 days based on various estimates. “Bought the DIP. My lovely $SHIB. If someone can pull [a] miracle recovery, it’s SHIB. I’m expecting ATH soon before or shortly after BTC halving. Nfa,” Lucie remarked.</p>

<p></p>
<h2>Shiba Inu Set To Overtake Dogecoin?</h2>
<p>Lucie&#8217;s confidence may be mirrored in another daring prediction by the Shiba Inu team on X, where they assert SHIB&#8217;s potential to eclipse Dogecoin in market capitalization through strategic moves referred to as &#8220;Secret Wags.&#8221;</p>
<p>Reacting to CryptoCom&#8217;s classification of SHIB as the second most valuable meme-inspired project, the Shiba Inu team hinted at a future where SHIB dethrones DOGE, stating, &#8220;[Number] 2 today, but the Doge days are numbered.&#8221;</p>
<p>The competition between SHIB and DOGE is not new; both tokens have vied for dominance in the past. DOGE currently holds the #10 spot in market cap among all cryptocurrencies, with SHIB trailing closely at #11. The market cap gap between DOGE and SHIB stands at $4.14 billion, with DOGE boasting a market cap of $19.41 billion compared to SHIB&#8217;s $15.27 billion.</p>

<p>To reach a new all-time high against its competitor, DOGE, SHIB would need to rally another 50% (SHIB/DOGE), building on the 98% gain against DOGE over the last four weeks.</p>
<img alt="SHIB vs DOGE" class="wp-image-598873 size-full" height="1673" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SHIBDOGE_2024-03-20_14-03-05.png?resize=3628%2C1673" width="3628" />
<p>Despite previous attempts to surpass Dogecoin, the Shiba Inu team remains undeterred, buoyed by the growing utility of the Shiba Inu ecosystem beyond its meme coin origins. The <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/company/shibarium-activity-skyrockets-by-30-with-shiba-inus-soaring-prices/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">development of Shibarium</a>, a blockchain platform offering various utilities for crypto development, and the rallying support of the #ShibaArmy, underline the team&#8217;s determination.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got the #ShibaArmy, #Shibarium, and secret wags we can&#8217;t reveal yet. Get ready for a new top doggo. Much wows incoming! #SHIB,&#8221; the team enthusiastically stated.</p>

<title>Crypto Expert Reveals Why XRP Price Will Rise 1,700% To $10</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/why-xrp-price-rise-1700-to-10/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/why-xrp-price-rise-1700-to-10/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。一位加密领域专家指出，尽管XRP价格在本市场周期表现不佳，但他认为这种加密标记仍有潜力。他预测XRP价格可能上升至10美元，将市值拉至5000亿美元至1万亿美元。与此同时，其他分析师也对XRP在本牛市表现乐观，认为XRP有望实现良好成绩。虽然目前XRP价格为0.58美元，但技术分析师预测其在本市场周期高峰时可能上升至27美元。 <div>
<p>Despite <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-price-action-legal-expert/" rel="nofollow">concerns</a> about the XRP price performance in this market cycle, this crypto expert has elaborated on why he believes the crypto token will still <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-is-primed-for-growth/">record significant gains</a>. He even predicts that XRP could rise to as <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-800-5-90-days/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CXRP%20To%20%245%20In%2090,of%20a%20prolonged%20bull%20market.%E2%80%9D">high as $10</a>. </p>
<h2>Why XRP Price Could Rise To As High As $10</h2>
<p>Nick, the founder of Web3Alert, mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/NCashOfficial/status/1769175168021148074?s=20" rel="nofollow">post</a> that his price range for XRP in this market cycle is between $5 and $10. According to him, this is possible considering that there are predictions that ETH will rise to between <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-to-10000-programmed/" rel="nofollow">$7,500 and $10,000</a> and Bitcoin will rise to between <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/fundstrat-exec-bitcoin-150000/">$100,000 and $150,000</a>. </p>

<p>Nick noted that the XRP price rising to between $5 and $10 would put its market cap at $500 billion and 1 trillion, respectively. That puts the crypto token’s market cap in a similar category to that of Bitcoin and Ethereum, which could be valued as high as $2.9 trillion and $1.2 trillion if their price predictions are fully actualized. </p>
<p>In other words, Nick argues that XRP hitting these prices is not farfetched since there is still much room for growth for the two largest crypto tokens by market cap, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-crypto-analyst-1900/#:~:text=If%20that%20happens%2C%20Ethereum%20could,its%20current%20price%20of%20%241%2C600.">Bitcoin and Ethereum</a>. As those two tokens continue to increase in price, he expects XRP to follow suit. Interestingly, he opined that his XRP prediction is “conservative,” suggesting XRP could go way higher. </p>
<p>Following Nick’s assertion, another X user <a href="https://x.com/Dat_Dude_Derek_/status/1769181926500204741?s=20" rel="nofollow">remarked</a> that comparing XRP to Bitcoin and Ethereum seemed out of place since BTC and ETH’s price prediction is just a 2x, unlike XRP, which will need to see a 10x in its price to hit those targets. Nick <a href="https://x.com/NCashOfficial/status/1769185024329347145?s=20" rel="nofollow">responded</a> that this simply shows that XRP is undervalued and presents a great ROI opportunity in this cycle. </p>
<h2>The Belief In XRP’s Potential</h2>
<p>Nick joins a list of crypto analysts who have expressed optimism about XRP’s potential in this market cycle <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrps-underperformance-ruffles-feathers-as-community-asks-ripple-to-do-something-about-price/" rel="nofollow">despite its underperformance</a> to start this bull run. <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-biggest-ipo-ever/" rel="nofollow">Crypto expert Zach Rector</a> also <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-is-primed-for-growth/">recently shared</a> his belief and gave reasons why XRP is still bound to perform well in this bull market. </p>

<p>Although he didn’t give any price prediction, he alluded to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-ceo-success-for-xrp/" rel="nofollow">XRP’s fundamentals</a> as one reason why he holds this belief. Meanwhile, technical analysts like Egrag Crypto have also made bullish price predictions for XRP heading into this market cycle. Egrag has even gone as far as <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/crypto-4400-xrp-price-27/#:~:text=Crypto%20Analyst%20Predicts%204400%25%20XRP%20Price%20Surge%20To%20%2427%2C%20Here's%20When,-by%20Scott%20Matherson&amp;text=Crypto%20analyst%20Egrag%20Crypto%20continues,this%20is%20a%20real%20possibility.">suggesting</a> that the XRP price could rise to as high as $27 at the peak of this bull run. </p>
<p>At the time of writing, the XRP price is trading at around $0.58, down over 3% in the last 24 hours, according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xrp/" rel="nofollow">data</a> from CoinMarketCap. </p>

<title>Altcoins Shows Buy Signals, Massive Opportunity Beckons: Analyst</title>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。当前比特币价格下跌，但市场中仍然有看涨的氛围。专家认为，这是购买另类币的良机，因为另类币市场即将进入另类币季。Michael Van De Poppe强调了另类币市场的重要机会，尤其是ARB。此外，Santiment也提到了几种另类币，如BOUNCE、LDO、OMG、STORJ和SNX，认为这些币可能有利可图。总体而言，尽管另类币市场有所波动，但未来看起来相当有利。 <div>
<p>As the price of Bitcoin (BTC) continues to demonstrate a major fall in valuation, indicating a gloomy attitude toward the crypto asset, the bulls in the market are hopeful that the market will soon enter another <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/altcoin-season-heres-what-glassnode-data/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Season for Altcoins</a>.</p>
<h2>Altcoins Showing Massive Buying Opportunity </h2>
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s recent dip signaled the beginning of the decline in the cryptocurrency market, causing several <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/press-releases/altcoins-wont-stop-pumping-scorpion-casino-vechain-and-theta-network-to-10x-next/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">altcoins</a> to drop significantly. However, many cryptocurrency analysts believe that the drop in these altcoin prices might serve as an opportunity for future gains since the alt-season is on the horizon.</p>

<p>Popular cryptocurrency expert and trader Michael Van De Poppe has <a href="https://x.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1770070969945653502?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">revealed</a> his optimism in the altcoin market, highlighting the significant opportunities of getting into these tokens before the alt-season begins.</p>
<p>According to Michael Van De Poppe, &#8220;some altcoins have now dropped by over 40%&#8221; in comparison to their past all-time high. As a result, Poppe believes that this is the right time for investors to purchase these digital assets to position themselves for future gains.</p>
<p>Poppe noted he normally invests in these tokens “during bull cycles when they are about 25% to 60% less expensive.” This demonstrates the crypto expert&#8217;s confidence in the assets to rally in the coming months.</p>
<p>While pointing out the massive opportunities in the market, Poppe has underscored <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/arbitrum-in-freefall-dips-below-2-as-experts-analyze-recovery-timelines/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Arbitrum (ARB)</a> as one of the altcoins investors should watch out for. He believes that ARB could realize substantial gains in time, as the token is down and poised for a new leg UP.</p>
<img alt="Altcoins" class="size-medium wp-image-598868" height="246" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Michael-Van-De-Poppe-Arbitrum-chart.png?w=460&#038;resize=460%2C246" width="460" />
<p>Recently, there have been notable advancements in the crypto asset&#8217;s price, demonstrating momentum for an upward movement. As of the time of writing, ARB was trading at $1.70, indicating an over 10% increase in the daily timeframe.</p>
<p>However, in the weekly and monthly timeframe, ARB is down by 22% and 15%, respectively. Meanwhile, Arbitrum&#8217;s market capitalization has increased by roughly 10% to exceed the $4.5 billion threshold.</p>
<h2>Top ALTs To Purchase After Bitcoin&#8217;s Retracement</h2>
<p>On-chain analyticS platform Santiment has also <a href="https://x.com/santimentfeed/status/1770249809280237856?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">highlighted</a> the drop in altcoins as a shot to garner profits in the upcoming months. Santiment pointed out several altcoins that offer a &#8220;possible bullish opportunity,&#8221; following <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crash-60800-worst-over-experts/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin&#8217;s crash</a> today to a two-week low of $61,700.</p>

<p>Some of the tokens listed by Santiment are BOUNCE, LDO, OMG, STORJ, and SNX. The MVRV Opportunity and Danger Zone Model, according to Santiment, shows that many altcoins have now declined to the point where mid-term trading returns are in an &#8220;opportunity zone.&#8221; However, when an asset&#8217;s 30-day, 90-day, and 365-day average wallet returns add up to be negative, “this zone is breached.”</p>
<p>Even with the recent general correction, the altcoins market appears to be headed toward a favorable long-term picture. Consequently, this presents an excellent chance for investors to purchase these digital assets at a reduced cost.</p>

<p>Michaël van de Poppe, an expert in the field, has identified encouraging market dynamics for Polkadot, suggesting a potential upward trajectory in the next few days or weeks.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Supply On Exchanges Hit 4-Year Low, But Why Is Price Crashing?</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-supply-on-exchanges-2/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章强调了比特币基本面的一些关键因素，表明市场已经为进一步增长做好准备。然而，最近的价格下跌引发了对此趋势的关注。数据显示比特币交易所的供应已降至4年低点，投资者似乎无意出售持有的比特币。虽然基本面强劲，但价格下跌可能是由于过度杠杆、以太坊走低和比特币ETF审批前景不明朗等因素导致的。此外，比特币可能正在进入“最后一次减半回调”阶段，在4月的减半事件之前可能会出现价格大幅调整。 <div>
<p>Certain Bitcoin fundamentals suggest the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-price-rise-above-57000/" rel="nofollow">flagship crypto token</a> is well primed for further growth in <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bull-market-glassnode/" rel="nofollow">this bull market</a>. However, its recent price decline has sparked concerns about the reason for this downward trend despite everything pointing to a sustained upward movement. </p>
<h2>Bitcoin Supply On Exchanges Hit 4-Year Low</h2>
<p><a href="https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/65f9a82a0d84564c5d5ce1b0-After-Selloff-Next-Steps-for-Traders-Review-of-Popular-On-Chain-Data" rel="nofollow">Data</a> from the on-chain analysis platform CryptoQuant highlighted that the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-ablaze-data-reveals-robust-demand-for-etfs/" rel="nofollow">supply of Bitcoin on exchanges</a> has seen nearly a 40% drop in 4 years and is reducing ahead of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/why-bitcoin-halving-could-provide-a-big-boost-to-these-altcoins-growth/" rel="nofollow">Bitcoin halving</a>. This underscores the bullish sentiment around the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-ordinals-craze-throws-up-challenges-and-opportunities-for-the-network/" rel="nofollow">Bitcoin ecosystem</a> as the decreasing supply on supply suggests that most investors have no plans to sell their holdings anytime soon. </p>

<p>The CryptoQuant data also noted that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-ablaze-data-reveals-robust-demand-for-etfs/" rel="nofollow">Bitcoin’s demand</a> is outpacing its supply, which is said to have been the prevailing trend since 2020. This development offers a bullish narrative as it can continue to increase Bitcoin’s value since “scarcity boosts perceived value.” This trend is also expected to be sustained once the Halving occurs since miners’ supply <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-supply-shock-57-of-btc-hasnt-moved-2-years/" rel="nofollow">will be cut in half</a>. </p>
<p>Interestingly, the imbalance between Bitcoin’s demand and supply has led crypto analysts like <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-demands-exceeds-supply/">MacronautBTC to believe</a> that BTC’s price could rise to as high as $237,000. As such, there are still high expectations for Bitcoin despite the crypto token hitting a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-breaks-through-69000-setting-new-record/" rel="nofollow">new all-time high (ATH)</a> of $73,750. </p>
<h2>Why Bitcoin’s Price Is Crashing</h2>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/nobody-will-get-rich-investing-in-bitcoin/" rel="nofollow">Crypto analyst Alex Kruger</a> has <a href="https://x.com/krugermacro/status/1770240971223007251?s=20" rel="nofollow">outlined</a> different reasons why Bitcoin’s price is crashing despite its strong fundamentals. The first reason he alluded to was the fact that crypto traders in the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-derivatives-market-volumes-show-bullish-trend-after-2022-downturn/" rel="nofollow">derivatives market</a> look to be overleveraged, possibly because greed seems set to be setting in with traders deploying more capital in anticipation of further price surges. </p>
<p>Kruger mentioned that the ETH could also be dragging the market down with the hopes of the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/crypto/sec-announcement-crypto/#:~:text=What%20The%20SEC's%20Latest%20Announcement%20Means%20For%20The%20Crypto%20Industry,-by%20Scott%20Matherson&amp;text=A%20recent%20announcement%20by%20the,actions%20have%20had%20on%20it.">SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission)</a> approving the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-spot-etfs-sec-commissioner-signals-smooth/" rel="nofollow">Spot Ethereum ETFs</a> waning. Bitcoinist recently reported that the approval odds for these investment funds have plummeted immensely in the past few months, dropping to an alarming 35%. </p>

<p>The third reason that Kruger mentioned is the negative <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/evaluating-performance-bitcoin-etfs-since-launch/" rel="nofollow">Bitcoin ETF inflows</a>, which have become a trend lately. Interest in these Bitcoin funds has cooled off, with investors opting to take profit instead. On March 19, BitMEX Research <a href="https://x.com/BitMEXResearch/status/1770365847925612714?s=20" rel="nofollow">revealed</a> that these ETFs saw a record net outflow of $326m. </p>
<p>Crypto trader and analyst Rekt Capital also <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crashed-65000/#:~:text=The%20flagship%20cryptocurrency%2C%20Bitcoin%2C%20dropped,Halving%2C%20which%20is%20fast%20approaching.">suggested</a> that Bitcoin is already in the ‘Final Pre-Halving Retrace.’ Therefore, significant price corrections can be expected ahead of the Halving event, which is set to take place in April. </p>
<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $63,000, down in the last 24 hours, according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/" rel="nofollow">data</a> from CoinMarketCap. </p>

<title>High-Stakes Week For Bitcoin And Ethereum As Central Bank Decisions Approach: Key Predictions</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/high-stakes-week-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum-as-central-bank-decisions-approach-key-predictions/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/high-stakes-week-for-bitcoin-and-ethereum-as-central-bank-decisions-approach-key-predictions/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。本文讨论了2024年第一季度加密市场和两大加密货币比特币和以太坊可能面临的重要时刻。预计央行将宣布政策，导致市场波动。比特币价格预计波动范围为9.78％，而以太坊短期波动较高，但交易者对其未来表现不太乐观。市场看涨情绪较低，而市场看跌情绪占主导地位。此外，altcoin的杠杆已减少，有助于市场稳定。目前，比特币价格为62500美元，比起24小时前下跌了7.5％；以太坊价格为3276美元，比起24小时前下跌了6.8％。 <div>
<p>This week could mark a pivotal moment in the first quarter of 2024 for the entire crypto market and the two largest cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), as major central banks, led by the Bank of Japan and the US Federal Reserve (Fed), prepare to announce their <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/fomc-preview-bitcoin-crypto-fed-rate-move/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">interest rate decisions</a>. </p>
<p>According to crypto futures exchange Blofin, these announcements will set the tone for monetary policy in the coming months. The impact of safe-haven sentiment has led to a pullback in both BTC and ETH prices, with traders expressing greater optimism for BTC. </p>
<h2>Bitcoin Price Movement Range Projected At 9.78%</h2>
<p>As per a recent on-chain analysis <a href="https://medium.com/@BloFin_Official/blofin-whales-view-week-11-2024-2f4ecc640093" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">report </a>released by the exchange, crypto traders are expecting BTC&#8217;s price movement range to reach 9.78% over the next seven days, with a projected 30-day range of 20.33%. </p>
<p>However, despite the expected volatility, the report indicates that traders remain bullish on BTC in the medium to long term. </p>

<p>Skewness analysis suggests that price declines and pullbacks are expected to induce volatility, but the duration of this round of pullback is expected to be relatively short. Risk aversion to macro uncertainty is seen as the primary trigger. </p>
<p>The latest dealers&#8217; gamma distribution supports the expected wide range of BTC <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crashed-65000/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">price fluctuations</a>, with gamma peaks around $65,000 and $75,000. With the quarterly settlement approaching, market makers&#8217; influence on BTC price movement is gradually recovering, providing support during price drops but making it challenging to surpass the $75,000 level. </p>
<img alt="Bitcoin" class="size-large wp-image-598716" height="382" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot_82.jpg?w=811&#038;resize=811%2C382" width="811" />
<p>In addition, on-chain data shows a decline in spot investors&#8217; enthusiasm for buying BTC, although the number of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/shiba-inu-ecosystem-blooms-bone-jumps-26-with-3-target-in-sight/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">addresses </a>holding more than 100 BTC continues to increase, as seen in the chart above. The reduced number of addresses holding over 1,000 BTC suggests that significant holders have decided to sell at BTC&#8217;s new highs. </p>
<p>Despite caution over potential price fluctuations, the hedging effect contributes to the increasing possibility of BTC price stabilization, making holding BTC a favorable choice.</p>
<h2>Bearish Sentiment Dominates Front-Month Options For Ethereum</h2>
<p>According to the report, similar to BTC, traders expect relatively high volatility levels for ETH in the short term, with projected price movement ranges of 10% over seven days and 20.32% over 30 days. However, the report suggests that traders are less optimistic about ETH&#8217;s future performance compared to Bitcoin. </p>
<p>Furthermore, Blofin finds that bearish sentiment dominates the front-month options, while bullish sentiment remains favorable in the back-months. Blofin emphasizes that expectations of rate cuts may support the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/japans-1-5-trillion-pension-fund-assess-bitcoin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">ETH price</a>, but the pricing of Ethereum tail risk indicates &#8220;increased pessimism&#8221; regarding significant events impacting the ETH price, with spot Ethereum ETFs seen as a potential trigger. </p>

<p>Finally, Blofin explains that the high leverage of altcoins has long been a “source of risk” in the cryptocurrency market. The recent price decline has led to the liquidation of many highly leveraged altcoin positions, resulting in lower annualized funding rates for perpetual contracts. </p>
<p>This deleveraging of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-prediction-0-5850/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">altcoins</a>, coupled with their relatively small market share of less than 20%, has helped to mitigate risk and contribute to market stability, according to the report. However, despite the overall decline in altcoin leverage, speculation in meme coins continues.</p>
<img alt="Bitcoin " class="size-large" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/bMHrh3p8/" width="1815" />
<p>At present, the price of Bitcoin stands at $62,500, reflecting a significant decline of 7.5% within the last 24 hours. Similarly, Ethereum is trading at $3,276, experiencing a 6.8% drop during the same period.</p>

<title>Market Turmoil? Not For XRP: 130% Volume Spike Stuns Investors</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/market-turmoil-not-for-xrp-130-volume-spike-stuns-investors/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/market-turmoil-not-for-xrp-130-volume-spike-stuns-investors/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的<br /> XRP的交易量激增，CoinMarketCap数据显示，24小时内增长130%，达到40亿美元。XRP的价格虽略有下跌至0.605美元，但过去一个月涨幅超过8%。美国证监会与瑞波实验室的有利法院裁决为XRP带来了监管明晰，主要交易所重新列出或宣布恢复与XRP的交易，激发投资者对XRP的热情。交易所如Coinbase、Kraken、Bitstamp和Binance.US的重启或重新列出XRP在提升交易量方面发挥了关键作用。 Coinbase数据显示，XRP价格过去24小时下跌3%，过去一周下跌17%。另一方面，YCharts数据显示，XRP价格为0.6539美元，较前一天增长5.61%，较一年前增长68%。 <div>
<p>The surge in XRP trading volume has been significant, with multiple sources reporting substantial increases over a short period. On March 19, 2024, CoinMarketCap data revealed an increase in <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xrp/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">XRP&#8217;s trading volume</a> by 130% to over $4 billion within 24 hours.</p>

<p>This surge occurred amidst a general market downturn, where XRP&#8217;s trading volume increase helped offset some losses experienced by other assets. Despite a slight decrease in XRP&#8217;s price to $0.605, the asset remained in the green over the last month, showing an increase of more than 8%.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-598814" height="381" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_06adf3.png?resize=1024%2C381" width="1024" /></p>

<h2>Market Developments Trigger Spike</h2>
<p>One of the key drivers behind this <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/company/xrp-rockets-to-the-top-leading-asset-surges-with-5-billion-volume-surge/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">uptick in trading volume</a> is a favorable court ruling between the US Securities and Exchange Commission and Ripple Labs. This ruling provided much-needed regulatory clarity for XRP, leading to major exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken, Bitstamp, and Binance.US either relisting or announcing plans to resume trading with XRP.</p>
<p>The increase in trading volume also reflects an uptick in investor enthusiasm for XRP. The trading volume spike, which at one point constituted over 22% of XRP&#8217;s market capitalization, indicates <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-on-the-crosshair-as-trading-begins-on-us-backed-exchange/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">a strong wave of interest</a> and confidence among investors. Additionally, an impressive price rally in XRP, with the price soaring by nearly 100% at one point, further fueled trading activity as investors capitalized on the price movement.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/LX3TA3dD/" width="2475" /></p>

Exchange Listings Boost Trading Activity
<p>The reopening or relisting of XRP on major exchanges post-court ruling played a pivotal role in boosting trading volume. Exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken, Bitstamp, and Binance.US reopening XRP trading provided traders with increased opportunities, contributing to the boost in overall trading volume.</p>
<p>In the past week, the price of XRP has experienced notable fluctuations, reflecting a mix of ups and downs in the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p>According to Coinbase, XRP&#8217;s price has seen a 3% decrease in the last 24 hours and a significant 17% decline over the past week. This downward trend indicates a challenging week for XRP investors as the price struggled to maintain its position.</p>

Varied Price Data From Different Sources
<p>On the other hand, YCharts data presents a slightly different picture, indicating an XRP price of 0.6539 USD on March 19, 2024. This figure represents a 5.61% increase from the previous day and a significant 68% uptick from one year ago, showcasing a more <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/xrp-on-the-brink-bullish-pattern-or-profit-taking-retreat/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">positive outlook</a> for XRP in the long term.</p>
<p>Investors and traders are closely monitoring XRP&#8217;s development as it works through the uncertainty in the market. A break below the 200-day moving average at $0.57 could be the first sign of impending market decline.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Price Crashes To $60,800: Is The Worst Over? Experts Weigh In</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章讨论了比特币价格暴跌的原因，包括过度杠杆、以太坊对市场情绪的负面影响、比特币 ETF资金流出、以及有关Solana的狂热讨论。多位专家分析了此次下跌的原因，并提出了对未来走势的看法。文中还提到了比特币历史价格波动的方式，指出目前回调的幅度在正常范围内。此外，有关FOMC决策和对市场预期的影响也引起了一些猜测。最后，比特币交易价格为62,979美元。 <div>
<p>Bitcoin has experienced a sharp decline from its March 14 high of over $73,600 to today&#8217;s low of under $60,800, translating to a -17% loss in value. This significant drop has prompted a flurry of activity on social media platforms, particularly X (formerly Twitter), where crypto experts have been fervently discussing the potential reasons behind this downturn and speculating on what the future holds for the world&#8217;s leading cryptocurrency.</p>
<h2>Unpacking The Bitcoin Crash: Expert Opinions</h2>
<p>Alex Krüger, a respected figure in both macroeconomics and crypto, was quick to identify the primary factors contributing to Bitcoin&#8217;s price collapse. According to Krüger, the crash can be attributed to several key factors: excessive leverage in the market, Ethereum&#8217;s negative influence on overall market sentiment due to ETF speculations, a notable decrease in Bitcoin ETF inflows, and the irrational exuberance surrounding <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana-memecoin-presale-gone-wrong-creator-accidentally-burns-10m-whale-makes-huge-profit/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Solana memecoins</a>, which he refers to disparagingly as &#8220;shitcoin mania.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Reasons for the crash, in order of importance </p>
<p>(for those who need them)</p>
<p>#1 Too much leverage (funding matters)#2 ETH driving market south (market decided ETF not passing)#3 Negative BTC ETF inflows (careful, data is T+1)#4 Solana shitcoin mania (it went too far)</p>

<p></p>
<p>WhalePanda, another influential voice within the crypto space, pointed out the alarming rate of ETF outflows, with a record $326 million leaving the market yesterday. This movement has been particularly detrimental to GBTC, which saw outflows of $443.5 million.</p>

<p>In contrast, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-etf-frenzy-blackrock-smashes-expectations-with-788-million-inflows-in-one-day/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Blackrock&#8217;s inflows</a> stood at a mere $75.2 million, marking its second lowest to date. Also, Fidelity saw just $39.6 million in inflows. “Not much to say, this is bad for the price and we&#8217;ll probably see lower now because this news affects the sentiment as well. Let&#8217;s see what the flows are tomorrow. Positive thing is that we&#8217;re roughly 30 days from halving, and GBTC is getting rekt,” he remarked.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Charles Edwards, founder of crypto hedge fund Capriole Investments, <a href="https://twitter.com/caprioleio/status/1770049266532466783" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">provided</a> a historical perspective on Bitcoin&#8217;s recent price move, suggesting that a 20% to 30% pullback is within the norm for Bitcoin bull runs.</p>
<p>“A normal Bitcoin bullrun pullback is 30%. Back in December, we were already in the longest winning streak in Bitcoin&#8217;s history. A 20% pullback here takes us to $59K. A 30% pullback would be $51K. These are all levels we should be comfortable expecting as possibilities,” he stated.</p>
<p>Rekt Capital provided an analysis of Bitcoin&#8217;s price retracements since the 2022 bear market bottom, noting that the current pullback is only the fifth major retrace, with all previous ones exceeding a -20% depth and lasting from 14 to 63 days. In sum, there are two key takeaways about this current retracement</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>The closer Bitcoin gets to a -20% retrace, the better the opportunity becomes.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Retraces need time to fully mature (at least 2-3 weeks, at most 2-months).</strong></p></blockquote>

<p></p>
<p>Alex Thorn, head of research at crypto giant Galaxy Digital had previously <a href="https://twitter.com/intangiblecoins/status/1770132069986820476" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">warned</a> of the likelihood of significant corrections during bull markets, suggesting that the current retrace is relatively standard. “Two weeks ago i warned that big corrections aren’t just possible but *likely* in Bitcoin bull markets. At -15%, this is pretty standard historically. Bull markets climb a wall of worry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Macro analyst Ted (@tedtalksmacro) focused specifically on the implications of the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/fomc-preview-bitcoin-crypto-fed-rate-move/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting</a>. He <a href="https://twitter.com/tedtalksmacro" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">highlighted</a> the massive outflows from spot BTC ETFs, attributing them to traders&#8217; cautious stance ahead of the FOMC decision and the potential impact of tax season in the US.</p>
<p>However, following the drop to $60,800, Ted suggested that the market might have fully priced in the worst-case scenario, hinting at a potential bullish reversal if the FOMC&#8217;s decisions align with market expectations for interest rate cuts by the end of the year. He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Time to bid. FOMC hedging done, worst case priced. Only thing that happens from here is that those protective positions unwind into or on the event today. Bulls should step up here soon. [&#8230;] The market has fully priced in another hold from the Fed at today&#8217;s meeting, and is pricing 3 rate cuts from them by the end of the year. Anything that strays away from this from today&#8217;s new economic projection / dot plot material will make the market move sharply.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>At press time, BTC traded at $62,979.</p>

<title>DeFi Turmoil: Over $5 Million Wiped Out In Liquidations Amid Ethereum Price Drop</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。DeFi生态系统在以太坊价格急剧下跌的情况下陷入了崩溃边缘，触发了超过5.4 million美元的强制清算。以太坊价格暴跌至3200美元以下，导致抵押贷款在DeFi协议中面临追加担保要求。在同一时间范围内，数字派生品触发了逾5200万美元的清算。整个加密市场也经历了高度波动，受到即将举行的美联储公开市场委员会（FOMC）会议的影响。以太坊目前正在接近10%的下跌，并且交易量为29百万美元。以太坊未来可能会避免更多下跌，因为看涨情绪在3200美元的支撑水平上巩固，为接下来的恢复奠定基础。 <div>
<p>The decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem teetered on the brink of a meltdown yesterday as cascading liquidations swept through the market following a sharp drop in Ethereum (ETH) price. Over $5.4 million in collateralized assets were forcibly sold off in a 24-hour period, raising concerns about the stability of the DeFi house of cards.</p>

<p>Ethereum, the world&#8217;s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, bore the brunt of the liquidations. Its price plummeted over 9% to below $3,200, a far cry from its recent high of $4,092.</p>
<p>This price swing triggered a domino effect, as collateralized loans used to amplify returns in DeFi protocols faced margin calls. <a href="https://parsec.fi/dashboard" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Data from Parsec</a> paints a bleak picture, with a potential $24 million liquidation event looming if ETH price dips further to $3,008.</p>

<h2><strong>On-Chain Derivatives Spark $52 Million DeFi Liquidation Blitz</strong></h2>
<p>To make matters worse, within the same time frame, major on-chain derivatives have triggered liquidations totaling more than $52 million. After selling at a high of $4,100 for Ethereum, short traders recouped their losses by repurchasing the cryptocurrency at $3,200.</p>
<p>The pain wasn&#8217;t shared equally, however. Panic selling by long position holders, those betting on an ETH price increase, resulted in a whopping $104 million in liquidations compared to a  little over $16 million for short sellers. This imbalance could exacerbate the ETH price decline, creating a negative feedback loop.</p>
<p>The situation highlights the inherent risks associated with leverage in DeFi protocols, While leverage can magnify profits, it can also amplify losses, especially during periods of high volatility.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/LqPlcqUh/" width="2475" /></p>

<p>The bloodbath wasn&#8217;t confined to the DeFi space. The broader crypto market experienced heightened volatility as investors braced for the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting. The potential for a Federal Reserve interest rate hike, coupled with weak inflows into Spot Bitcoin ETFs, cast a shadow of bearish sentiment across the digital asset landscape.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-598784" height="431" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_e2ef84.png?resize=633%2C431" width="633" /></p>

<h2><strong>Ethereum Price At A Glance</strong></h2>
<p>Currently, Ethereum (ETH) is experiencing a decline of nearly 10% and is currently trading at $3,138. The 24-hour trading volume for ETH stands at $29 million.</p>
<p>Ethereum had a 20% retracement, making it the second most significant decliner among the top 10 cryptocurrencies. ETH traders maintained their sense of confidence by retaining and mitigating their positions in anticipation of an impending period of recovery.</p>

<p>Based on the prevailing market indicators, it is plausible that the price of Ethereum may evade more drops in the foreseeable future, as the bullish sentiment seeks to consolidate at the support level of $3,200, thereby establishing a foundation for a subsequent phase of recuperation.</p>

<title>BNB Price Could Restart Rally If It Is Able To Hold This Key Support</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/bnb/bnb-price-could-restart-rally-500/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/bnb/bnb-price-could-restart-rally-500/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。BNB价格在$600以上遭遇卖家压力，出现下跌修正并测试重要支撑位$500。价格目前在$515附近并且在4小时图上的100简单移动平均线附近交易。关键的熊市趋势线形成在$520附近，可能阻碍上涨。支撑位在$500、$470和$430，阻力位在$520、$550和$580。技术指标显示MACD处于熊市区间，RSI目前低于50水平。 <div>
<p><em>BNB price rallied further above $600 before it faced sellers. The price corrected gains and now testing an important support at $500.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>BNB price started a downside correction from the $645 resistance zone.</li>
<li>The price is now trading near $515 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $520 on the 4-hour chart of the BNB/USD pair (data source from Binance).</li>
<li>The pair could attempt a fresh increase if it stays above the $500 support zone.</li>
</ul>
<h2>BNB Price Holds Support</h2>
<p>In the last BNB price prediction, we discussed the chances of more gains above the $550 resistance zone. The price continued to rise and broke many hurdles near the $580 level.</p>
<p>BNB even outperformed <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-turns-red-62k/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin</a> and <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-bears-aim-3000/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ethereum</a> with a move above the $600 resistance. Finally, it faced resistance near the $645 zone. A high was formed near $645 and the price recently started a downside correction. There was a move below the $600 level.</p>
<p>The price declined below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $365 swing low to the $645 high. The price is now trading near $515 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). Immediate resistance is near the $520 level.</p>
<p>There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance near $520 on the 4-hour chart of the BNB/USD pair. The next resistance sits near the $550 level. A clear move above the $550 zone could send the price further higher.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Binance-Coin-BNB-2.png?resize=1024%2C461"><img alt="BNB Price" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-598761" height="461" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Binance-Coin-BNB-2.png?resize=1024%2C461" width="1024" /></a></p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BNBUSD/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">BNBUSD on TradingView.com</a></p>
<p>In the stated case, BNB price could test $580. A close above the $580 resistance might set the pace for a larger increase toward the $600 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $645 level in the coming days.</p>
<h2>More Losses?</h2>
<p>If BNB fails to clear the $520 resistance, it could continue to move down. Initial support on the downside is near the $500 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $365 swing low to the $645 high.</p>
<p>The next major support is near the $470 level. The main support sits at $430. If there is a downside break below the $430 support, the price could drop toward the $400 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $350 level.</p>
<p>Technical Indicators</p>
<p>4-Hours MACD – The MACD for BNB/USD is gaining pace in the bearish zone.</p>
<p>4-Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BNB/USD is currently below the 50 level.</p>
<p>Major Support Levels – $500, $470, and $430.</p>
<p>Major Resistance Levels – $520, $550, and $580.</p>

<h2>Ethereum Price Breaks Support</h2>

ETH declined below the $3,350 support level to move further in a short-term bearish zone.</p>
<p>Finally, the price traded below the $3,200 support. A low was formed at $3,162 and the price is now consolidating losses. It is showing a few bearish signs below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-extends-losses-3200/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">downward wave</a> from the $3,675 swing high to the $3,162 low.</p>

<p>The next major resistance is near $3,550, above which the price might gain bullish momentum. In the stated case, Ether could rally toward the $3,650 level. If there is a move above the $3,650 resistance, Ethereum could even rise toward the $3,800 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of $4,000.</p>
<h2>More Losses In ETH?</h2>

<title>Ether.fi (ETHFI) Sell-Off Intensifies As Arrington XRP Capital Shifts Holdings To Binance, Will $3 Support Hold?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。Ether.fi的治理代币ETHFI在币安上出现了显著价格下跌，引发了投资者的担忧。然而，最近的链上活动导致了进一步的抛售猜测，可能威胁到代币的稳定性。Arrington XRP Capital在平台上进行了一系列交易活动，引发了对代币价格的担忧。Ether.fi团队对这些猜测做出了回应，表示这些活动是提前知情的，并解释了他们的动机。Arrington Capital也对猜测进行了澄清，并强调他们的行动并未利用协议的分配方法。 <div>
<p>ETHFI, the governance token for the Ether.fi staking protocol has seen a significant drop in price <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ether-fi-210m-airdrop-sparks-market-turbulence-ethfi-value-drops-by-35/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">since its debut</a> on Binance on Monday, March 18. After initially trading at $4.13, the token has lost over 25% of its value, raising concerns among investors. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, recent on-chain activity has fueled speculation of further sell-offs, potentially threatening the token&#8217;s stability and its ability to hold the $3 mark. In particular, blockchain analytics firm Nansen has identified interesting behavior involving Arrington XRP Capital on the Ether.fi platform, highlighting some significant transactions.</p>
<h2>Price Concerns For ETHFI </h2>
<p>In a recent <a href="https://x.com/nansen_ai/status/1769778475341349347?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post </a>on social media site X (formerly Twitter), Nansen&#8217;s analysis reveals interesting activity involving venture capital fund Arrington XRP Capital on the Ether.fi platform. </p>
<p>According to the blockchain analytics firm, Arrington XRP Capital minted 5,000 units of eETH, Ether.fi&#8217;s natively reshaped liquid <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-plunges-64000-on-chain-support/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">staking token</a>. Notably, these eETH tokens were distributed to ten different wallets, each containing 500 units.</p>

<p>Following the distribution, Arrington XRP Capital proceeded to claim a total of 200,498 ETHFI tokens across the ten wallets. The funds were transferred to another address, consolidating the acquired ETHFI tokens. </p>
<p>In the final step of the observed activity, Arrington XRP Capital sent the entire balance of ETHFI tokens to the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/binance-smart-chain/bnb-price-soars-as-binance-smart-chain-implements-bep-336-upgrade-inspired-by-ethereums-dencun/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Binance </a>cryptocurrency exchange, potentially for selling purposes, which could put further pressure on ETHFI.</p>
<p>However, the Ether.fi team has responded to the speculation surrounding the on-chain movements made by Arrington XRP Capital.</p>
<h2>Ether.fi Clarifies </h2>
<p><a href="https://x.com/ether_fi/status/1769880889452872000?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">According </a>to Ether.fi, Arrington XRP Capital has been a consistent investor in the platform and has provided significant support since its inception. The statement further noted that as early adopters and active stakers, the Arrington team has actively staked its assets on Ether.fi, contributing to the platform&#8217;s growth. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-suffers-massive-drop-on-bitmex-bulls-over/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">multi-wallet distribution</a> observed in recent activity did not surprise Ether.fi, as they were reportedly informed of this approach in advance.</p>
<p>Ether.fi claimed that splitting the assets into multiple wallets did not provide additional benefits or change the distribution outcome. The protocol alleged that consolidating the assets into a single wallet would have produced the same results.</p>
<p>The protocol alleged that these assets are part of their liquid funds, which are &#8220;actively traded.&#8221; The decision to transfer the assets to the Binance cryptocurrency exchange was motivated by the nature of their trading activities and liquidity needs, the Ether.fi team concluded.</p>
Arrington Capital Addresses Speculations
<p>The Arrington Capital team also clarified the context through a social media <a href="https://x.com/Arrington_Cap/status/1769889156610609268?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>. They clarified that they had been long-term investors, staking over $50 million of ETH since February 2023. </p>
<p>The company claimed that the recent sale of a &#8220;small percentage&#8221; of its initial airdrop tokens amounted to less than $700,000, allegedly representing only 0.1% of the day&#8217;s trading volume.</p>

<p>Ultimately, Arrington Capital emphasized that their actions were not a “Sybil attack” and did not exploit the protocol&#8217;s distribution methodology. They wrapped up their response by claiming that <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/fomc-preview-bitcoin-crypto-fed-rate-move/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">airdrop </a>distribution follows a linear model that is &#8220;unaffected&#8221; by distribution across multiple wallets.</p>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。CrediBULL Crypto预测了XRP的上涨，指出了XRP/BTC交易对的积累阶段，并预测了15-20%的涨幅。他们也观察到了RSI分歧，显示XRP已经进入了一个可能发生牛市反转的关键区域。其他市场专家也看好XRP的潜力，认为其基本面牢固，有望达到更高的价格目标。尽管最近价格下跌了13%，XRP的交易价格仍然坚挺在0.6美元。 <div>
<p>Recently, a renowned figure in the crypto analysis sphere, CrediBULL Crypto, has <a href="https://twitter.com/CredibleCrypto/status/1769745357599056015?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">spotlighted</a> XRP with a bullish prediction. According to the analyst, XRP is on the verge of a significant rally that could surge its value<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-on-the-crosshair-as-trading-begins-on-us-backed-exchange/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> against Bitcoin</a> in the coming period.</p>
<h2>XRP Price: Anticipating The Surge</h2>
<p>CrediBULL Crypto has been closely monitoring XRP&#8217;s movements against Bitcoin. Through analysis, he observed an interesting trend within the XRP/BTC trading pair that suggests an upcoming uptick.</p>

<p>The key to this prediction is identifying an accumulation phase happening at a lower timeframe within a higher demand zone. This pattern is not new to the analyst, who has identified similar trends.</p>
<p>The insights provided by CrediBULL Crypto indicate a potential 15-20% rally for XRP against Bitcoin in the near term. Should the altcoin break through the next <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/ripple-behind-xrp-price-crash/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">major resistance</a>, which is pegged 35% higher, the analyst believes this could trigger a surge, rewarding investors with returns exceeding 100% against BTC.</p>

<p>A week before this bullish forecast, CrediBULL Crypto had already increased its position on the XRP/BTC pair, driven by an &#8220;RSI divergence&#8221; observed on the 3-day chart. Such divergences are often harbingers of a significant market turnaround, suggesting that the altcoin had entered a pivotal region ripe for a bullish reversal.</p>
<h2>XRP&#8217;s Foundation For Growth</h2>
<p>The potential for XRP isn&#8217;t just a matter of speculative trading. Other market experts have highlighted the cryptocurrency&#8217;s fundamentals. Zach Rector, a prominent voice within the crypto community, has also recognized the altcoin&#8217;s potential.</p>
<p>By drawing parallels with Bitcoin, Rector points out the foundation of XRP and the XRPL, setting the stage for XRP&#8217;s <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-is-primed-for-growth/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">significant impact in the next market upturn</a>.</p>

<p>Analyst Dark Defender also sees a bright future for the altcoin, predicting a<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-to-skyrockets-to-1-33-amidst-april-rally-analysts/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> climb to the $1.33 price level</a> as an immediate target. Moreover, he suggests that reaching the $1.88 and $5.85 Fibonacci targets in the forthcoming weeks is well within the realm of possibility</p>

<title>Record-Breaking GBTC Outflows Send Bitcoin Down 14% To $62,000</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。据《财富》杂志报道，比特币价格出现大幅波动，最近从历史最高价下跌14％至62,483美元。格雷斯卡尔公司的比特币信托基金（GBTC）出现创纪录的资金流出超过640万美元，影响了比特币表现。此外，投资者在美国联邦公开市场委员会（FOMC）会议前展现了谨慎态度，密切关注利率变化。此外，加密期货交易者也受到重创，面临超过440万美元的损失。尽管价格出现调整，比特币在过去30天和年初至今的时间段中仍保持相当大的涨幅。 <div>
<p>As <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/03/19/bitcoin-slumps-62000-gbtc-fed-rate-cut-waiting-game/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reported </a>by Fortune Magazine, the cryptocurrency market has been experiencing significant volatility as Bitcoin (BTC) has experienced a sharp decline that has had a domino impact on other cryptocurrencies. The recent drop in the price of Bitcoin, coupled with outflows from Grayscale&#8217;s GBTC, has raised concerns among investors. </p>
<h2>Bitcoin Sees 14% Correction From ATH</h2>
<p>Bitcoin suffered a 14% drop since reaching its <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/breaking-news-ticker/breaking-bitcoin-hits-new-all-time-high-surging-past-70000-for-the-first-time-in-history/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">all-time high</a> (ATH) of $73,700 last week, briefly touching $62,483 on Tuesday morning. However, it recovered and stabilized around $64,900, just below the $65,000 mark. </p>

<p>The decline was attributed to record outflows of over $640 million from Grayscale&#8217;s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). In comparison, other spot Bitcoin ETFs saw inflows of less than $500 million, resulting in a net outflow of $15 million on Monday, <a href="https://x.com/JSeyff/status/1769946247438155909?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">according </a>to Bloomberg ETF expert James Seyffart. </p>
<img alt="Bitcoin " class="size-large wp-image-598723" height="277" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GJAciI_XcAApiWN.png?w=774&#038;resize=774%2C277" width="774" />
<p>This <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-plunges-64000-on-chain-support/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">outflow </a>from GBTC, combined with the cautious sentiment surrounding the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in the US, has had a significant impact on Bitcoin&#8217;s performance.</p>
<p>As recently <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/fomc-preview-bitcoin-crypto-fed-rate-move/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">reported </a>by NewsBTC, investors exhibited caution ahead of the FOMC meeting, closely monitoring the potential changes in interest rates. Recent higher-than-expected inflation data, as indicated by the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI), dampened expectations of interest rate cuts. </p>
<p>According to Fortune, the CME FedWatch Tool projected a 99% likelihood of rates remaining unchanged, further affecting <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crashed-65000/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">market sentiment.</a> Per the report, investors were keen to gauge the Federal Reserve&#8217;s stance on monetary policy, contributing to the cautious trading environment.</p>
<p>In the same context, the Bank of Japan raised its key interest rate from -0.1% to 0% to 0.1% in response to rising consumer prices. This was the first rate increase in 17 years.</p>
<h2>Crypto Futures Traders Take A Hit</h2>
<p>The drop in Bitcoin&#8217;s price had a cascading effect on other cryptocurrencies. Major altcoins like <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-extends-losses-3200/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ethereum </a>(ETH) and Solana (SOL) experienced significant declines of 8.1% and 12.5% over the past 24 hours, respectively. </p>
<p>Meme coins, including Floki Inu (FLOKI), Bonk Inu (Bonk), and Dogecoin (DOGE), also suffered losses of 34%, 28.5%, and 24.8%, respectively, during the past week. </p>

<p>The decline in cryptocurrency prices resulted in over $440 million worth of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-etf-crypto-liquidations/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">liquidations </a>for traders of crypto futures. Traders who had leveraged positions betting on higher prices faced significant losses. Most of these liquidations occurred on Binance, totaling $212 million, followed by OKX at $170 million. </p>
<img alt="Bitcoin " class="size-large" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/s9TU7X4K/" width="1815" />
<p>Despite its price correction, BTC retains substantial gains of over 26% and 132% in the past thirty days and year-to-date timeframe, respectively.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Halving Retrace Spooks Investors: What Is It And Why Does It Matter?</title>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章介绍了加密货币市场在过去一天出现意外发生的全面下跌，但Rent Capital预测到了这种情况，指出这与比特币已建立的减半趋势相符。分析表明，比特币在减半之前的月份遵循的趋势，通常会出现价格崩盘。根据之前的数据，比特币价格在减半前的一个月内通常会下跌约20%至38%，这次可能会下跌大约25%。价格崩盘是比特币价格遵循已建立的减半趋势的证实，也预示着即将到来的牛市。这种崩盘也被认为是最后一次以最低价格入场的机会。最近，比特币价格在63,500美元附近交易，但在日图上下跌5.91％，在周图上下跌12.19％。 <div>
<p class="p2">The <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crashed-65000/">Bitcoin price crash </a>over the past day has taken crypto investors by surprise, leading to a full bleed day for the industry. However, while this may have come as a shock to many, some were able to call it out ahead of time. One of those is Rent Capital, which said the decline was in line with Bitcoin’s established halving trend.</p>
<h2 class="p2">An Expected Crash</h2>
<p class="p2">The analysis <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crashed-65000/">posted</a> by Rest Capital outlines the trends that Bitcoin has followed leading up to its halving months. In 2020, the halving fell on the month of May and in the month leading up to the rally, the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crashed-65000/">Bitcoin price</a> saw an approximately 20% decline.</p>

<p class="p2">Over the years, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-approaches-risky-territory-as-halving-event-draws-near/">Bitcoin has followed similar patterns</a> to usher in the anticipated halving and while there has been some deviation this time around, the digital asset looks to be maintain some trends. One of these trends is the price crash before the halving.</p>
<p class="p2">As Rekt Capital’s analysis shows, Bitcoin is right in region of where this crash is expected to happen. The previous trends have seen the price fall between 20% and 38% in the month before the halving. So taking this into account, the BTC price could crash around 25% on average if it sticks to this trend.</p>
<p class="p2">The crypto analyst also revealed their target for if Bitcoin follows this trend. The crash is expected to push the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-suffers-massive-drop-on-bitmex-bulls-over/">BTC price</a> below the $40,000. However, if the average plays out, then the price could bottom out above $40,000 before rebounding.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Why This Crash Is Important For Bitcoin</h2>
<p class="p2">The crash is a confirmation that the Bitcoin price is following the established pre-halving trend and also confirms the incoming bull market. Going by the previous trends, the halving takes place after the crash, following which there is some upside the is seen with the cryptocurrency.</p>

<p class="p2">Then, in the months following the halving, there is massive accumulation that serves as a precursor to the bull market. In this case, this accumulation is expected to begin sometime in April 2024 and then continue on for a few months.</p>
<p class="p2">The crash, as Rekt Capital points out, also serves as the last opportunity for <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/fomc-preview-bitcoin-crypto-fed-rate-move/">cryptocurrency investors</a> to get into position at the lowest prices. This is because once the halving is complete and the bull market begins, low prices become a thing of the past.</p>
<p class="p2">At the time of writing, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-suffers-massive-drop-on-bitmex-bulls-over/">the BTC price</a> is seeing minor recovery from its crash below $63,000. It I trading at $63,500, but with a 5.91% decline on the daily chart and a 12.19% decline on the weekly chart, according to CoinMarketCap.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Might Be Poised For A  ‘Double Pump Cycle,’ Reveals Analyst – Here’s Why</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。加密分析师Willy Woo预测比特币将迎来稀有的“双泵”周期，预计2024年中和2025年将出现两次重要价格涨幅。尽管BTC最近经历了10%的下跌，但解决下跌势头的关键需求区在61,000美元，可能会吸引机构投资者。同时，根据加密分析师Charles Edwards的观察，BTC在特许的牛市拉回幅度约为30%，因此下跌至59,000美元甚至51,000美元的水平也是可能的购买机会。 <div>
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s recent downturn has prompted renowned crypto analyst Willy Woo to offer a fresh <a href="https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1770048197584683412?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">perspective</a> on the cryptocurrency&#8217;s future trajectory. Woo&#8217;s analysis, based on the surge in Bitcoin&#8217;s Macro Index, suggests an optimistic outlook for the leading digital currency, potentially indicating a pivotal shift in market dynamics.</p>
<h2>Unveiling Bitcoin Double Pump Prediction</h2>
<p>Willy Woo, a figure well-respected in the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/planbs-bitcoin-forecast-a-journey-to-5-million/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">cryptocurrency analysis</a> sphere, has recently shared insights that paint an intriguing future for Bitcoin.</p>

<p>According to Woo, the notable increase in the Bitcoin Macro Index could signal more than just a recovery; it might be the precursor to a rare &#8220;double pump&#8221; cycle.</p>
<img alt="Bitcoin Macro Index" height="649" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GJB5LsKbkAAajAz?format=jpg&amp;name=medium" width="1200" />
<p>Drawing parallels with the market patterns 2013, Woo&#8217;s forecast points towards two significant price surges for Bitcoin in the coming years. He anticipates the first peak by mid-2024 and a second, even more substantial top in 2025.</p>
<p>This dual surge scenario, though historically uncommon, aligns with Woo&#8217;s analysis of current market conditions and Bitcoin&#8217;s intrinsic <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/japans-1-5-trillion-pension-fund-assess-bitcoin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">growth potential</a>.</p>

<h2>Navigating Through The Bearish Terrain</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, the past week has not been kind to BTC, with the asset experiencing a roughly 10% decline. This downward trend extended over the past 24 hours, seeing Bitcoin&#8217;s value <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crashed-65000/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">dip</a> by 4.9%, bringing its <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-plunges-64000-on-chain-support/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">price to around $65,000</a>—a sharp fall from its recent peak above $73,000.</p>
<img alt="Bitcoin (BTC) price chart on TradingView" class="size-medium" height="1556" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/RvnsCvxk/" width="2770" />
<p>Amid this bearish price action, IntoTheBlock, a notable crypto analytics firm, suggests the $61,000 level as a critical demand zone, highlighted by the significant volume of Bitcoin purchased at this price point.</p>
<p>This area is deemed attractive for accumulation by institutional investors and large-scale traders, suggesting a possible recovery in the near future.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Bitcoin is looking for support. But where will it find it?
The $61k range could be a key area to keep an eye on. 805k addresses acquired over 466k BTC at this level, indicating a healthy appetite for <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">$BTC</a> around that level. <a href="https://t.co/XYw7LSC6Ji" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/XYw7LSC6Ji</a></p>

<p>Additionally, as Bitcoin navigates its<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/fomc-preview-bitcoin-crypto-fed-rate-move/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> current market challenges</a>, cryptocurrency analyst Charles Edwards points out that a typical pullback during a Bitcoin bull run amounts to about 30%.</p>

<p>With BTC having experienced its longest winning streak in history, a corrective dip to $59,000 or even $51,000, as per some predictions, remains within the realm of possibility.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">A normal Bitcoin bullrun pullback is 30%. Back in December, we were already in the longest winning streak in Bitcoin&#8217;s history. A 20% pullback here takes us to $59K. A 30% pullback would be $51K. These are all levels we should be comfortable expecting as possibilities.</p>

<p>These levels represent potential buying opportunities for investors looking to capitalize on Bitcoin&#8217;s cyclical nature and its anticipated ascension post-pullback.</p>

<title>Crypto Presale Frenzy Raises Over $122M Worth Of SOL In A Week</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。加密货币市场下跌，导致大多数加密货币出现红色数字。投资者转向预售狂潮，尝试从MEME代币中获利。截至3月12日以来，预售已筹集122.5万美元。27个基于Solana的MEME代币预售项目吸引了巨额资金，但许多项目在推出后迅速衰退。投资者面临损失，而欺诈者也利用这一趋势进行钓鱼诈骗。这种趋势可能导致MEME代币疲劳，对长期稳定性有害。 <div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The crypto market is down as most cryptocurrencies have registered red numbers for the past few days. Expectations of making big profits out of the bullish sentiment are momentarily halted. And while many patiently wait for the prices to rise again, others are seemingly looking for different options to make their bags.</p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto Presale Frenzy Sees Big Numbers</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The “<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solanas-biggest-memecoin-gains-681000-in-3-days-as-more-investors-bet-on-its-popularity/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">memecoin mania</a>” has been at the forefront of the market, stealing the spotlight since February. As a result, investors might see a window of opportunity to profit from these tokens.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">During the previous bull cycle, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) were at the center of the stage, with millions of dollars invested in the tokens. This time, the biggest memecoins by market cap are being outshined by some of the newer players.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Dogwifhat and other <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-tokens-among-top-gainers-jup-and-wen-soar-over-12-wif-hits-new-ath/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Solana-based tokens</a> have led the way during this leg, registering massive gains in the last month. Recently, the presale and launch of Book of MEME (BOME), which started as a small experimental project, saw its surge to a $1 billion market cap in a few days.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The memecoin surge has now turned into a memecoin presale frenzy, with presale launching left and right after becoming the “meta” of the market.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="es">PRE SALE META <a href="https://t.co/z02vQWnnhz" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/z02vQWnnhz</a></p>

<p></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The meta term, borrowed from the gaming community, refers to the Most Effective Tactic Available. As such, investors and scammers are equally attempting to take profit off the trend.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto investigator ZachXBT revealed on X that the current “presale meta” trend has raised $122.5 million since March 12. Taking the BOME project as a starting point, the crypto detective counted 27 different presales from Solana-based memecoins since that date. These projects raised approximately 655,000 SOL, according to the crypto sleuth calculations.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I was interested to see how much SOL has been sent as a result of the presale meta and calculated &gt;655,000 SOL ($122.5M) raised from 27 presales. <a href="https://t.co/dvsW4TSoov" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/dvsW4TSoov</a></p>

<p></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">To put the numbers into perspective, ZachXBT highlighted that these figures only account for the projects on the Solana chain in the last seven days. This means that the calculations are only one part of the bigger image as the presales before March 12, and chains like Ethereum, Base, and BSC are excluded.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Memecoins Raising Millions In Minutes</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest raiser on the list was the SMOLE token by visual artist Dekadente. This project received 169,982 SOL during the presale and has seen notable support from the community.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, the recently launched Slerf raised over 50,000 SOL. However, the token faced a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana-memecoin-presale-gone-wrong-creator-accidentally-burns-10m-whale-makes-huge-profit/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">dramatic launch</a> after its creator accidentally burned the tokens reserved for the presale participants airdrop.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the presales <a href="https://twitter.com/ozempicsol/status/1769885246642954430" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">raised millions</a> in a matter of minutes, which hints at impressive participation from the crypto community. However, many <a href="https://x.com/Ape848/status/1769973480731082808?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">suggest</a> that the massive figures raised come from “fabricated fomo” and “insiders sending sol that they’ll eventually get back.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Despite raising millions in SOL, the presale meta trend left investors with nothing. As the investigator highlights, many of the presales on his list have seen a “hard rug” or the tokens’ momentum quickly fading after launch. As a result, the presale participants’ investments vanished or diminished considerably.</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, scammers have taken their chance to profit off the presale frenzy. Phishing scams under the presale posts have skyrocketed, with impersonating accounts trying to drain investors’ wallets or collect whatever amount people meant to send to the presale addresses.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Members of the crypto community have expressed their concerns over the presale trend. Many crypto investors consider the trend might create memecoin fatigue, which <a href="https://twitter.com/barkery91/status/1769626690538320018" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">could hurt</a> the organic projects aiming for long-term stability.</p>

<title>Injective Launches Important Token Tool As INJ Bleeds</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/injective/injective-launches-important-token-tool-as-inj-bleeds/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/injective/injective-launches-important-token-tool-as-inj-bleeds/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。Injective Protocol推出了TokenStation，允许用户在其主网上创建原生代币，降低了代币创建的门槛。此外，与Volan合作升级了INJ代币经济学，使其逐渐紧缩。此外，与Rollup Technologies的合作有望提高Injective的安全性。尽管Injective在DeFi领域的声誉有所提升，并与Ethereum等平台进行合作，但其总锁定价值（TVL）相对较低，而INJ价格受到一定压力。 <div>
<p>Injective Protocol, a decentralized finance-centric platform, has launched TokenStation. In a <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.tokenstation.app/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> on March 18, Injective said the solution, deployed on its mainnet, allows users to launch native tokens. With this tool, Injective said it would empower anyone to create their tokens in a low-fee and scalable environment.</p>
<h2>Injective Launches TokenStation, Strikes Key Partnership</h2>
<p>The tool was developed by the Injective community and aims to &#8220;remove barrier to entry for token creation.&#8221; Like the token creation tools on Solana and Ethereum, for example, using TokenStation, part of the blog post won&#8217;t require coding experience. </p>
<p>Related Reading: <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crashed-65000/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Top Reasons Why The Bitcoin Price Crashed Below $63,000</a></p>
<p>This makes it easier for individuals and projects to launch on Injective. Beyond token minting, the tool allows token management and integration of tokenomics mechanisms like burning.</p>
<p>The blockchain is launching the TokenStation days after partnering with <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://blog.injective.com/en/injective-and-altlayer-bring-restaking-security-to-evm-applications/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">AltLayer</a>, a platform backed by Binance Labs dedicated to developing roll-up technology for Ethereum. Through this collaboration, the two will build a re-staking security framework for Injective Ethereum Virtual Machine (inEVM) applications.</p>
<p>The recently launched inEVM allows developers to seamlessly build applications leveraging the high scalability and near-zero fees on Injective. Additionally, the inEVM is set to increase composability between WebAssembly (WASM) and EVM environments. Through this unique feature, Injective can bridge the interoperability of Cosmos, the developer activity of Ethereum, and the high scalability of Solana. </p>
<h2>Will Volan Help Prop Up INJ Prices?</h2>
<p>In January, Injective Protocol <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://blog.injective.com/en/a-new-era-of-injective-the-volan-mainnet-upgrade/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">activated</a> the Volan Upgrade, setting the platform&#8217;s plans to build a robust real-world tokenization infrastructure into motion. Part of this was the introduction of a Real-World Asset (RWA) module. In this way, institutions can launch regulatory-compliant security tokens. </p>
<p>Additionally, Volan modified INJ tokenomics, making the token progressively deflationary. Burning reduces INJ tokens over time, a measure adopted by other protocols, including BNB and Ethereum.</p>

<p>While the upgrade and subsequent partnerships have lifted its prominence in decentralized finance (DeFi), growth has been slower than expected. </p>
<img alt="Injective TVL | Source: DeFiLlama" class="size-full wp-image-598677" height="354" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot592.png?resize=1024%2C354" width="1024" />
<p>So far, DeFiLlama data <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://defillama.com/chain/Injective" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">shows</a> that Injective Protocol commands a total value locked (TVL) of less than $65 million. This is miles behind Solana or Ethereum, two of the world&#8217;s most active smart contract platforms where active DeFi protocols also thrive.</p>
<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/x/T5jUkfpP/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="Injective prices trending downward on the daily chart | Source: INJUSDT on Binance, TradingView" class="size-full" height="904" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/T5jUkfpP/" width="1787" /></a>
<p>Meanwhile, INJ prices, although relatively higher, are under pressure, as seen in the candlestick arrangement in the daily chart. INJ is down 30% from 2024 highs, slipping and following <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crashed-65000/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin</a>. However, the coin is within a broader consolidation. Resistance and support levels are around $44 and $30, respectively.</p>

<title>Crypto Report Says ‘Alameda Gap’ Is Gone After Bitcoin Rally, What This Means</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/crypto-alameda-gap-bitcoin-rally/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/crypto-alameda-gap-bitcoin-rally/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />最近的研究报告指出了过去影响比特币和加密市场的“阿拉米达鸿沟”，但现在该鸿沟似乎已经消失。阿拉米达鸿沟源自Alameda的倒闭，导致市场缺乏流动性。然而，市场已经恢复了，比特币的市场深度几乎已完全恢复。比特币在价值上的表现胜过黄金，吸引了更多投资者。从长期来看，人们可能将黄金视为比特币的替代品。<br /> <div>
<p>In its most recent research newsletter, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-as-one-of-the-best-performing-assets-report/" rel="nofollow">crypto research firm Kaiko</a> alluded to an ‘Alameda Gap,’ which has been massively impacting the Bitcoin and crypto market for some time now. However, that seems to be in the past, as Kaiko stated that the gap no longer exists. </p>
<h2>What The Alameda Gap Is About</h2>
<p>According to the <a href="https://research.kaiko.com/insights/eth-lags-post-upgrade" rel="nofollow">report</a>, the ‘Alameda Gap’ is the gap in liquidity that existed after the collapse of the collapse of the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/major-reveals-from-the-ftx-bankruptcy-filing-whats-the-takeaway/">defunct crypto exchange FTX</a> and its sister company <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/blockfi-resolves-dispute-with-ftx-alameda-research/" rel="nofollow">Alameda Research</a>. Alameda was one of the most prominent market makers then and provided massive liquidity to the market. </p>

<p>Following Alameda’s collapse, this liquidity gap is said to have persisted as market makers “waited on the sidelines for sentiment and trading activity to recover.” Now, the market looks to have moved past this, as Kaiko revealed that, as of last week, the market depth has almost fully recovered and is back to its <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-collapse-sam-bankman-fried-trial/" rel="nofollow">pre-FTX average</a>. </p>
<p>The research firm added that the Bitcoin 2% market depth is up 40% year-to-date (YTD) and briefly surpassed its pre-FTX average of $470 million. This increase is said to have been mainly due to the surge in Bitcoin’s price, which has risen faster than the market liquidity since the SEC approved the Spot Bitcoin ETFs in January. </p>
<p>Bitcoin is up about 50% YTD and has already hit new highs since the beginning of the year, including a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-breaks-through-69000-setting-new-record/" rel="nofollow">new all-time high (ATH)</a> of $73,750. Meanwhile, the improvement in liquidity is also evident in the fact that the cost of trading has declined on the three major US crypto exchanges: Coinbase, Kraken, and Bitstamp. </p>
<h2>How Bitcoin Is Outperforming Gold</h2>
<p>Kaiko also highlighted in its report that the Bitcoin-to-Gold ratio, which measures both assets’ relative performance, is inching closer to its ATH, which it last hit in November 2021. Interestingly, this increase means that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/spot-bitcoin-etf-flows-flip-gold-capital-rotation/" rel="nofollow">BTC is outperforming Gold</a>, even though <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-and-gold-hit-record-breaking-milestones/" rel="nofollow">both assets have recorded ATHs</a> these past few weeks. </p>

<p>Furthermore, funds linked to these assets show how Bitcoin has outperformed Gold. Kaiko noted that Bitcoin ETFs have attracted $11 billion since they launched in early January. Meanwhile, the largest <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/spot-bitcoin-etf-flows-flip-gold-capital-rotation/" rel="nofollow">physically-backed Gold ETFs</a> (SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) and iShares Gold Trust (IAU) have <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/gold-out-bitcoin-in-etf-investors-flock-to-btc/" rel="nofollow">registered outflows</a> during the same period. </p>
<p>Kaiko suggested that this could mean that investors were moving towards Bitcoin as the “new global store of value.” Interestingly, the CEO of Jan3 and Bitcoiner, Samson Mow, while giving reasons why Bitcoin will hit $1 million, also <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-reach-1-million/#:~:text=Mow%20mentioned%20during%20an%20interview,demand%20far%20exceeds%20its%20supply.">mentioned</a> that people will start demonetizing Gold and substitute it for BTC at some point.  </p>

<title>AVAX Price Soars To Highest In Nearly 2 Years, Over 80% Of Holders In Profit</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/avalanche/avax-price-soars-to-highest-in-nearly-2-years-over-80-of-holders-in-profit/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/avalanche/avax-price-soars-to-highest-in-nearly-2-years-over-80-of-holders-in-profit/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。Avalanche (AVAX)在过去一周表现出色，在数字资产中成为表现最佳的加密货币之一，并达到了近两年来的最高价格。AVAX从市场信号中获得了提振，包括持有人的利润增加，大宗交易量增加，现货市场需求增加，以及期货合约的开放利息上升。市场观察家对AVAX的未来走势持谨慎乐观态度，未来有望建立在$70附近，但可能会遇到阻力。 <div>
<p>Avalanche (AVAX), the 10th-ranked cryptocurrency, has been on a tear in the past week, not only emerging as the top performer among major digital assets but also reaching its highest price point in nearly two years.</p>

<p>According to CoinMarketCap data, AVAX surged by an impressive 20%, surpassing its previous peak in May 2022 and reaching a<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/avalanche" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> price of $60</a> at the time of writing. This remarkable rally has ignited a wave of bullish sentiment within the crypto community.</p>
<h2><strong>AVAX Gets Boost From Strong Market Signals </strong></h2>
<p>Analysts are pointing to a confluence of on-chain activity and market signals that paint a bullish picture for AVAX. NewsBTC&#8217;s analysis revealed<a href="https://app.intotheblock.com/coin/AVAX" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> a key factor:</a> 84% of AVAX holders are currently sitting on profits, signifying a wave of positive sentiment within the investor community. This profitable position fosters a more optimistic environment, potentially attracting new buyers to the market.</p>

<p>Digging deeper into on-chain data, market observers at NewsBTC noticed a significant rise in large buy orders on the Avalanche network. This trend suggests that institutional investors or whales might be accumulating AVAX, potentially fueling the upward price movement.</p>
<p>The bullish momentum isn&#8217;t confined to on-chain activity. The spot market is also exhibiting strong demand for AVAX. <a href="https://coinalyze.net/avalanche/open-interest/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Coinalyze data</a> indicates a steady rise in the token&#8217;s Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) since March 17th. CVD is a metric that gauges the difference between buying and selling volumes, and its current uptick suggests a clear dominance of buying pressure in the spot market.</p>

<h2><strong>Positive Vibes In The Air For AVAX</strong></h2>
<p>The derivatives market is echoing the optimism as well. Open Interest (OI) in AVAX futures contracts has been on an upward trajectory, reflecting a growing interest from investors looking to leverage the potential price increase.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that OI doesn&#8217;t necessarily indicate a long-biased market (where more traders are betting on a price rise), but rather highlights increased participation from both buyers and sellers.</p>
<p>However, the rising price alongside surging OI suggests that buyers are currently more aggressive, potentially leading to a breakout above resistance levels.</p>

<p>With this bullish tailwind propelling AVAX forward, analysts are cautiously optimistic about its future trajectory. Some market observers are of the opinion that AVAX has the potential to reach $70 soon.</p>
<p>However, they acknowledge the presence of a psychological hurdle at $70, where the price might encounter some resistance before continuing its climb. If the bulls can overcome this <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/avax-slips-adding-tension-to-365-million-avalanche-token-unlock-drama/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">obstacle</a> and achieve a decisive breakout, the bullish target of $75 might be within reach.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/BNhoEiw8/" width="1835" /></p>

<p>Looking at the potential downside risks, the article warns of a possible rejection at $70, which could trigger a price correction back down to $63. The report also emphasizes that the predicted upswing might not be a linear path, with potential price fluctuations along the way.</p>

<p>Avalanche (AVAX) is experiencing a period of strong momentum, buoyed by positive on-chain data, a surge in investor interest, and a bullish market sentiment. While some resistance levels and potential price corrections are to be expected, the overall outlook for AVAX appears promising in the near future.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Plunges Under $63,000, Here’s Where Next On-Chain Support Is</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-plunges-64000-on-chain-support/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-plunges-64000-on-chain-support/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。比特币价格下跌至63000美元以下，可能在61100美元、56685美元和51530美元的支撑水平处找到支持。另一方面，66990美元和72880美元的高成本基础水平可能会成为阻力。这些支撑和阻力水平基于链上数据，显示了投资者的购买活动，可能影响价格走势。BTC价格已下跌至62700美元，接近首个主要链上支撑水平。 <div>
<p>Bitcoin has deepened its decline in the past day with its price now slipping below $63,000. Here&#8217;s where the next potential support is, according to on-chain data.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Could Find Support At These Price Levels</h2>
<p>In a new <a href="https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1769979649600172220" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, analyst Ali has discussed how the Bitcoin support and resistance levels are looking like right now based on on-chain data from Glassnode.</p>
<p>The indicator of relevance here is the &#8220;<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/analyst-expect-decline-30220-bitcoin-loses-support/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">UTXO Realized Price Distribution</a>&#8221; (URPD), which, in short, tells us about the amount of coins (or more precisely, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-utxo-mid-long-term-holders-november-correction/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">UTXOs</a>) that were last purchased at any given price level that the asset has visited in its history so far.</p>

<p>Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the data for this distribution for the price levels around the recent spot value of the cryptocurrency:</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin URPD" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="1286" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GJA6duNWMAAECTA?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096" width="2404" /></p>

<p>From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that there are a few price levels not far from the current one that particularly stands out in terms of the amount of buying that took place at them.</p>
<p>In on-chain analysis, the potential for any level to act as support or resistance is based on the total number of coins that have their cost basis at the level in question.</p>
<p>Levels thick with coins that are situated under the current price would be probable to act as points of support, while those above the spot value could prove to be resistance walls.</p>
<p>As is apparent from the graph, the $61,100, $56,685, and $51,530 levels are the ones below the current price that hold the cost basis of a notable amount of the supply right now. Naturally, this means that should the decline continue further, these would be the levels to watch for a possible rebound.</p>
<p>Two levels above, however, are even larger than all three of these support levels: the cost basis centers around $66,990 and $72,880. Interestingly, the latter of these is the single largest acquisition level out of all the price levels listed in the chart, implying that a large amount of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-fomo-533330-addresses-bought-70180/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">FOMO buying</a> has occurred at the asset&#8217;s all-time high levels.</p>
<p>In the scenario that Bitcoin regains its upward momentum, these levels of high cost basis population would be where the asset could be most probable to find some trouble.</p>
<p>Now, as for why acquisition centers are considered relevant for support and resistance in on-chain analysis is the fact that investors are likely to show some kind of reaction when a retest of their cost basis takes place.</p>

<p>When such a retest is from above, the holders may decide to accumulate more, believing that the price will go up again in the future. On the other hand, they may sell instead if the retest is from below, as they may think exiting at break-even is better than risking another drop.</p>
<p>A large number of coins having their cost basis at the same level means a potentially large degree of one of these reactions happening and, hence, a strong support or resistance effect on the price.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>Bitcoin is inching closer to the first major on-chain support level as it has now dropped to $62,700.</p>

<title>Dogecoin Growth Hits Roadblock As Holder Activity Enters Dreaded Period Of Stagnancy</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-growth-holder-activity/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-growth-holder-activity/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。Dogecoin和其他主要热门炒作加密货币的地址数量增长速度已经减缓，尤其是在3月份。Dogecoin仅在本月新增了6万个地址，与2月份新增45万个地址的情况形成鲜明对比。其他热门炒作加密货币，如SHIB和PEPE，也没有看到持有者数量的增长。目前，DOGE的价格为约0.12美元，下跌近14%。这可能表明市场对炒作加密货币的关注正在减弱。 <div>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-5-3-million-holders-compares-top-coins/" rel="nofollow">The Dogecoin (DOGE) network</a> has entered a period of stagnancy, as the number of addresses holding the meme coin has slowed. This is a stark contrast to February and January, when the network experienced a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-doge-path-to-0-2/#:~:text=The%20Dogecoin%20adoption%20trend%20has,added%20in%20a%20single%20week.">significant expansion</a>. </p>
<h2>Dogecoin Has Added Only 60,000 New Addresses In March</h2>
<p><a href="https://app.santiment.net/charts/iXhlYy3R__sCl" rel="nofollow">Data</a> from the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/why-these-2-altcoins-could-witness-price-bumps/" rel="nofollow">market intelligence platform Santiment</a> shows that the total number of DOGE holders has increased by only 60,000 since the beginning of this month. At the start of the month, 6.51 million users were holding the meme coin, with this figure only increasing to 6.57 million since then.</p>

<p>This is unlike February when the total number of DOGE holders rose from 5.92 million to 6.51 million. Specifically, around this same time last month, the network had already seen an increase of 450,000 in the total number of addresses holding DOGE. Meanwhile, NewsBTC <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-doge-path-to-0-2/#:~:text=The%20Dogecoin%20adoption%20trend%20has,added%20in%20a%20single%20week.">reported</a> that over 400,000 new addresses were added in two weeks between January and February. </p>
<p>Dogecoin also set a new record in January alone when <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-doge-ready-to-pop/#:~:text=Dogecoin%20(DOGE)%20is%20getting%20ready,be%20added%20for%20it%20soon.">247,240 new DOGE addresses</a> were created on January 29. <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-analyst-predicts-1300-for-cardano/" rel="nofollow">Crypto analyst Ali Martinez</a> noted that a sustained uptrend in the network’s expansion “could soon reflect positively” on DOGE’s price. That underscores how significant the number of addresses holding the meme coin is. </p>
<p>The stagnancy in Dogecoin’s holder activity might also come as a surprise to some in the crypto community, considering the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/top-ai-meme-coins/" rel="nofollow">meme coin frenzy</a> that has taken the crypto space by storm. However, a plausible explanation is that meme coin traders aren’t necessarily invested in the prominent meme tokens but have their eyes on the undervalued gems. </p>
<h2>How Other Top Meme Coins Have Fared</h2>
<p>Data from Santiment also shows that the other two meme coins, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/big-moves-for-shiba-inu-pepe/" rel="nofollow">Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe (PEPE)</a>, which make up the top three largest meme coins by market cap, haven’t fared better. <a href="https://app.santiment.net/charts/iXhlYy3R__sCl" rel="nofollow">Shiba Inu</a> hasn’t seen its holder count increase since the beginning of the month, with the total number of users holding the meme coin still at 1.38 million. </p>

<p>On the other hand, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/similarities-dogecoin-and-pepe/" rel="nofollow">PEPE</a> still has less than 200,000 holders despite boasting a year-to-date (YTD) gain of over 370%. These figures place <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-shiba-inu-pepe-metric/" rel="nofollow">DOGE firmly ahead</a> of SHIB and PEPE in terms of the number of users they all have. Dogecoin is expected to see its user base pick up once again as soon as there is a renewed interest in network functionalities like the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/the-dogecoin-surge-unveiling-the-catalyst-behind-rising-transactions/">Doginals</a>. </p>
<p>At the time of writing, DOGE is trading at around $0.12, down almost 14% in the last 24 hours, according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dogecoin/" rel="nofollow">data</a> from CoinMarketCap. </p>

<title>Bitcoin Suffers Massive Drop On BitMEX, Is The Rally Over?</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-suffers-massive-drop-on-bitmex-bulls-over/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-suffers-massive-drop-on-bitmex-bulls-over/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要: 这些信息是消极的。本文讨论了比特币在BitMEX交易所上的急剧下跌到8,900美元的事件，导致市场普遍下滑。一位用户卖出400个比特币导致价格急剧下跌，引发了一系列价格波动。比特币价格从68,000美元下跌至8,900美元，随后恢复正常。彼得·施菲夫预测比特币可能会出现更大的崩盘。当前比特币价格为62,943美元，24小时内下跌7%。 <div>
<p>Since Bitcoin (BTC) witnessed a crash this week to $64,000, the crypto asset has not been able to reclaim its momentum, with the price falling <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-at-risk-65k/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">even lower.</a> This has led to a general market decline that has affected altcoins.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Plummets To $8,900 On BitMEX Exchange</h2>
<p>In a devastating turn of events, Bitcoin witnessed a steep decline on the Seycelles-based cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX on Monday. <a href="https://x.com/WuBlockchain/status/1769926754121232554?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Reports</a> from blockchain media, Wu Blockchain, revealed that Bitcoin fell to around $8,900, following a massive BTC sell-off on the platform.</p>

<p>Wu Blockchain reported that a user sold over 400 BTC, which led to the price of Bitcoin falling to the aforementioned figure. Over the space of two hours, the unidentified user sold the 400 BTC in groups of 10–50 BTC.</p>
<p>Consequently, BitMEX&#8217;s market stability was impacted since the user sold the assets for incredibly low prices. However, according to reports from Blockchain Daily, the event was short-lived as prices have now returned to the normal level.</p>
<p>In response to the development, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitmex-co-founder-bitcoin-forecast-btc-to-reach-1-million-amid-banking-turmoil/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">BitMEX</a> has assured the crypto community that it is &#8220;looking into odd behavior&#8221; involving users selling substantial orders on the spot market for BTC-USDT.</p>
<p>The crypto platform further stated that while the investigation is ongoing, &#8220;the derivatives market will still be operational, including the index price for its popular XBT derivatives contracts.&#8221; Furthermore, the exchange confirmed the safety of users&#8217; funds and assets, and the platform is &#8220;running as usual.&#8221;</p>
<p>Given that the price of Bitcoin was situated at $68,000 before the incident, the drop indicates an over 87% decline. After falling to $8,900, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-whales-btc-exchanges/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin</a> recovered, but the abnormal price fluctuations lasted for an additional 30 minutes before things returned completely to normal.</p>
<p>The development has since stirred quite a frenzy within the cryptocurrency landscape, leaving the community to ponder on the reason behind the drop. Several crypto enthusiasts believe that the incident was a move orchestrated by BitMEX to manipulate prices to liquidate investors and end up making a lot of money.</p>
<h2>Larger Crash Might Take Place</h2>
<p>As Bitcoin continues to move downward, Gold advocate and crypto critic Peter Schiff has <a href="https://x.com/PeterSchiff/status/1769907447420817520?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">forecasted</a> a larger crash for prices. At first, Peter Schiff drew the crypto community&#8217;s attention to the 2021 rally, in which BTC peaked at $69,000.</p>

<p>However, the largest cryptocurrency witnessed a collapse the next year, and by November 2022, it was already trading at $16,000. As a result, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/peter-schiff-spot-bitcoin-etfs/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Schiff</a> mocked Bitcoin enthusiasts, asking, &#8220;How many of them still have their laser eyes on their profiles.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus, considering that the majority are presently more optimistic about BTC, Schiff anticipates a &#8220;bigger crash&#8221; is probably on the horizon. </p>
<p>As of the time of writing, the price of Bitcoin was trading at $62,943, indicating an over 7% decline in the past 24 hours. Its market cap is down more than 7%, while its trading volume holds steady increasing by 63% in the past day.</p>

<title>FOMC Preview: Bitcoin and Crypto’s Fate Tied To Fed Rate Move</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章讨论了即将召开的联邦公开市场委员会（FOMC）会议对比特币和加密货币市场的影响。文章提到了比特币和以太坊在会议前期经历了严重的下跌，与美国经济指标和通胀数据有关。文章还提到了市场对FOMC利率和未来政策方向的预期，以及各种分析师对比特币和加密货币市场如何应对的看法。高盛预测了今年只会有3次降息。总之，市场正在谨慎地等待FOMC会议结果，并密切关注未来货币政策方向。 <div>
<p>In the lead-up to the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting scheduled for Wednesday, March 20, the Bitcoin and crypto market is experiencing a severe downtrend. BTC price has plunged roughly -10% in the past two days, and Ethereum (ETH) is down -12% in the same period.</p>
<p>The anticipation surrounding the Fed&#8217;s stance on interest rates has heightened in the wake of recent economic indicators, including unexpected <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/inflationary-concerns-rise-as-us-cpi-exceeds-predictions-bitcoin-price-reacts/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">spikes in the  US Consumer Price Index</a> (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI), stirring volatility across markets, including digital assets.</p>
<p>The consensus, with a 99% probability according to the CME FedWatch tool, suggests interest rates will hold steady. Nonetheless, the spotlight turns to the Fed&#8217;s dot plot, a graphical representation of the individual members&#8217; expectations for future interest rates, which could provide crucial insights into the monetary policy outlook for the coming months and years.</p>

<p>Anna Wong, Chief US Economist for Bloomberg, remarked via X (formerly Twitter), “Another reason why FOMC [is] not ready to cut: members not yet of broad agreement of that need. Here’s visualizing the dispersion of FOMC views with the help of our new weekly NLP Fed spectrometer. “</p>

<p></p>
<h2>How Will Bitcoin And Crypto React?</h2>
<p>Macro analyst Ted, expressing his perspective on X, underscores the nuanced relationship between macroeconomic trends and the crypto market at the moment. Ted elucidated that spot <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-etfs-see-record-1-billion-inflows/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin ETF flows</a> have taken the backseat while macro factors came to the foreground.</p>
<p>He <a href="https://twitter.com/tedtalksmacro/status/1769901194435338460" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">stated</a> via X, “If BTC is to be considered digital gold, it&#8217;s expected to mirror gold&#8217;s market movements, albeit with a higher degree of volatility. In the current climate, with the market bracing for the Fed&#8217;s upcoming meeting, macroeconomic factors momentarily take precedence, driven by recent developments in PPI and CPI figures.&#8221;</p>
<p>He further speculates that &#8220;Despite the eventual remarks from [Fed Chair] Powell, the market has already adopted a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/breaking-news-ticker/powell-speaks-at-jackson-hole-bitcoin-volatility-comes-back-with-a-vengeance/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">hawkish stance</a> in anticipation of a &#8216;higher for longer&#8217; interest rate scenario.&#8221;</p>

<p>Michaël van de Poppe, a noted figure in the crypto analysis domain, <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1769996367521353898" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">provided</a> his insights on the recent downward price movement of Bitcoin via X, citing a mix of factors including the anticipation of the FOMC meeting and significant capital outflows from <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/ethereum-news/grayscale-submits-revised-application-for-ethereum-spot-etf-whats-new/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Grayscale</a>&#8216;s Bitcoin Trust. Van de Poppe advises, &#8220;It&#8217;s typically in these pre-FOMC periods, perceived as risk-off intervals, that the savvy investor finds opportunities to &#8216;buy the dip&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a reflection of market sentiment adjustments, analyst @10delta on X<a href="https://twitter.com/_10delta_/status/1770036918991913188" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> pointed out</a> the strategic positioning of investors in anticipation of the Fed&#8217;s rate decisions. &#8220;The market is currently pricing in a reversal to the November &#8217;23 interest rate levels, a clear indication that investors are adjusting their expectations based on the Fed&#8217;s potential pivot signaled in the previous dot plot,&#8221; he noted.</p>
<p>Accordingly, he argues that the FOMC &amp; dot plot will be a &#8220;buy the news&#8221; event as the market expectations are being properly adjusted. &#8220;The macro worries [&#8230;] should dissipate &amp; crypto idiosyncratic bullish factors, such as the ETF inflows [&#8230;] as well as the BTC halving take hold. All considered I think there&#8217;s a good R/R for &#8216;buying the dip&#8217; heading into the March 20 event,&#8221; the analyst added.</p>
Goldman Sachs Predicts (Only) 3 Rate Cuts This Year
<p>Goldman Sachs Research recently provided a detailed analysis in their March FOMC Preview. The report highlights the nuanced balance the Fed seeks to achieve between controlling inflation and supporting economic growth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our revised forecast now anticipates three rate cuts in 2024, a slight adjustment from our previous prediction, primarily due to a modest uptick in the inflation trajectory,&#8221; Goldman Sachs analysts elucidated. They further speculate, &#8220;While the immediate focus is on maintaining current rate levels, the trajectory for rate cuts will hinge on inflation dynamics and economic performance indicators.&#8221;</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs further predicts that the Fed will still target a first cut in June. “This combined with a default pace of one cut per quarter implies that the most natural outcome for the median dot is to remain unchanged at 3 cuts or 4.625% for 2024,” the banking giant remarked.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Goldman: Inflation has been firmer in recent months, but we think it is still on track to fall enough by the June FOMC meeting for a first cut. <a href="https://t.co/0I1BPYiU8W" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/0I1BPYiU8W</a></p>

<p></p>
<p>As the crypto market and broader financial ecosystems await the outcomes of the FOMC meeting, the prevailing sentiment is one of cautious anticipation. Market participants are closely monitoring the Fed&#8217;s commentary for indications of future monetary policy directions via the dot plot.</p>
<p>The question for the Bitcoin and crypto market is whether there will be an unpleasant surprise or whether market participants were right with their &#8220;higher for longer&#8221; policy assumption.</p>
<p>At press time, BTC found support at the $62,400 price level, trading at $63,118.</p>

<title>Top Reasons Why The Bitcoin Price Crashed Below $63,000</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crashed-65000/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crashed-65000/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要: 这些信息是消极的。<br />比特币价格在过去24小时跌破了63,000美元，目前正处于价格修正阶段，最近创下73,750美元的历史新高。导致价格下跌的原因可能包括比特币减半即将到来。分析人士表示比特币正在进入减半趋势的第二阶段，长期持有者开始获利了，导致利润回吐。当前比特币情绪偏向熊市。 <div>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/why-bitcoin-halving-could-bring-uncertainty-to-mining-industry/" rel="nofollow">The flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin</a>, dropped below the $63,000 mark in the last 24 hours and is currently on a price correction, having recently hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $73,750. This price dip is believed to be due to several factors, including the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bull-market-glassnode/" rel="nofollow">Bitcoin Halving</a>, which is fast approaching. </p>
<h2>Bitcoin Price Is In The Second Phase Of The Halving Trend</h2>
<p>Crypto trader and analyst Rekt Capital <a href="https://x.com/rektcapital/status/1769656725341163692?s=20" rel="nofollow">recently provided</a> insights into the four phases of Bitcoin Halving, which provides a plausible explanation for Bitcoin’s recent decline. He suggested that Bitcoin was entering into the ‘Final Pre-Halving Retrace,’ having just concluded with the ‘<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/history-backs-buying-bitcoin-dip-before-halving/" rel="nofollow">Pre-Halving Rally</a>.’</p>

<p>This ‘Final Pre-Halving Retrace’ is said to occur 28 to 14 days before the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/grayscale-next-bitcoin-halving-different/">Halving event</a>. However, it looks to have come earlier this time around (just like the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-59000-pre-halving-rally/">Pre-Halving Rally</a>), with the Halving still about 30 days away. Rekt Capital alluded to the Pre-Halving retrace in 2016 and 2020 when Bitcoin pulled back by 38% and 20%, respectively. </p>
<p>Bitcoin has already pulled back over 11% in the past week. Interestingly, the analyst noted that this phase of the Halving can last “multiple weeks and up to 77 days.” Rekt Capital, however, expects it to be much shorter than <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/historical-bull-run-pattern-finally-forming-bitcoin/" rel="nofollow">historical ones</a>. He added that this year’s Pre-Halving Retrace “would more likely be on the shallower side than on the deeper side.”</p>
<h2>Long-Term Bitcoin Holders Are Taking Profit</h2>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/pro-xrp-lawyer-threat-crypto/" rel="nofollow">Alex Thorn</a>, Head of Research at Galaxy Digital, highlighted in an X (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/intangiblecoins/status/1769823573370150919?s=20" rel="nofollow">post</a> that long-term Bitcoin holders are starting to sell. This is evidenced by different metrics, such as the movement in coins that had stagnated for over a year. </p>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/analyst-predicts-when-dogecoin-will-reach-1/" rel="nofollow">Crypto analyst Ali Martinez</a> previously alluded to this wave of profit-taking, noting data from market intelligence platform Glassnode, which showed that those holding over 1,000 BTC were increasingly cashing out. This has also led to a 4.83% drop in this category of BTC addresses this past few weeks. </p>
<p>Thorn, however, sounded optimistic about Bitcoin’s future trajectory in his post, noting that new whales are entering (through the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-spot-etf-100-volume/" rel="nofollow">Spot Bitcoin ETF</a> market) as some others are exiting. He also suggested that some of these whales aren’t exactly leaving the market but selling their spot BTC and investing in Bitcoin ETFs instead. </p>
Bitcoin Sentiment Is Currently Bearish
<p><a href="https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData" rel="nofollow">Data</a> from Coinglass shows that the bears currently have the upper hand, with almost $82 million in <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-volatility-causes-over-300-million-in-liquidations-as-milei-moneda-is-set-to-generate-riches-for-investors/" rel="nofollow">long positions liquidated</a> in the last 24 hours compared to just about $23 million of shorts liquidated during the same period. </p>

<p>There has also been a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-open-interest-alarming-levels-brace-impact/" rel="nofollow">decrease in open interest</a> on these exchanges, which suggests that traders are choosing to stay out of the market at the moment. Therefore, activity in the derivatives market shows that the current outlook for Bitcoin is bearish, with many still expecting further declines. </p>
<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $63,000, down over 4% in the last 24 hours according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/" rel="nofollow">data</a> from CoinMarketCap. </p>

<title>Shiba Inu Ecosystem Blooms: BONE Jumps 44% With $3 Target In Sight</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />ShibaSwap的BONE代币在市场熊市中表现出色，备受关注。SHIB骑士预测其价格可能达到3美元，目前价格上涨并处于强劲的趋势中。BONE代币在过去30天内有了惊人的涨幅，目前价格为0.84美元，预计将突破3美元。为了提高BONE的市场可见性，Shiba Inu社区成员正在努力争取其在主要交易平台上的上市，这可能会为其带来大幅上涨的催化作用。 <div>
<p>Bone ShibaSwap (BONE), a token within the Shiba Inu ecosystem, has showcased remarkable resilience amidst a predominantly bearish market. Despite the downward trend, BONE has emerged as a top performer, catching the attention of community analyst SHIB Knight, who predicts further gains and a potential price target of $3.</p>

<p>SHIB Knight, a respected analyst within the Shiba Inu community, has been closely monitoring <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bone-shibaswap" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">BONE&#8217;s performance</a> and recently shared an update on the token&#8217;s outlook. Despite a previous failed breakout attempt, SHIB Knight remains optimistic, highlighting a chart that suggests BONE is now better positioned for an anticipated bullish breakout.</p>

<p>— $SHIB KNIGHT (@army_shiba) <a href="https://twitter.com/army_shiba/status/1769693757870379212?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">March 18, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>At the time of writing, BONE has experienced an impressive surge, with its price skyrocketing from a low of $0.87 to a high of $1.09. This surge represents a significant 44% gain in the monthly timeframe, accompanied by a substantial 60% increase in trading volume compared to the previous day.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-598641" height="389" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_a3a20d.png?resize=633%2C389" width="633" /></p>

<p>A Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 65 indicates that the Shiba Inu BONE Token is in a bullish trend and is seeing increased trading volumes after a spectacular 30-day rally. BONE is currently trading at $0.84.</p>
<p>While BONE&#8217;s current price hovers around $1.09, SHIB Knight has set a target price of $3, anticipating a potential 150% rally for the token. It is worth noting that the memecoin is currently down almost 98% from its all-time high in 2021, which implies ample room for growth.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/tjAjx8iK/" width="2475" /></p>

<p>The limited exposure of BONE among major centralized crypto trading platforms may have contributed to its slower price gains compared to the ecosystem&#8217;s leading token, SHIB. Currently, BONE is listed on platforms such as OKX and Gate.io, while notable exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, KuCoin, and Bybit have yet to support its trading.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I expected <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BONE&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">$BONE</a> to breakout of the channel, but it failed last time.</p>
<p>Breakout will happen sooner or later. Target is around $3 <a href="https://t.co/YJRRyST8kE" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/YJRRyST8kE</a></p>
<p>— $SHIB KNIGHT (@army_shiba) <a href="https://twitter.com/army_shiba/status/1769428146577682449?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">March 17, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>To address this limitation, leaders of the Shiba Inu community have rallied their members to campaign for BONE&#8217;s listing on Binance, one of the largest crypto exchanges. They firmly believe that inclusion on such a prominent platform would provide the necessary catalyst for explosive price rallies, potentially propelling BONE to unprecedented levels.</p>

<p>As demand for the Shiba Inu BONE Token rises and community members work strategically to achieve its listing and increase its market visibility, this positive momentum has raised investor intrigue about the token&#8217;s ability to cross the $3 threshold before the end of March.</p>
<p>Despite the inherent risks, the recent price surge of BONE and the optimistic outlook from SHIB Knight have generated excitement within the Shiba Inu community. Traders and enthusiasts will be closely monitoring BONE&#8217;s performance in the coming days, eagerly awaiting signs of a breakout and the potential for significant gains.</p>

<title>Japan’s $1.5 Trillion Pension Fund To Assess Bitcoin For Diversification</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/japans-1-5-trillion-pension-fund-assess-bitcoin/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/japans-1-5-trillion-pension-fund-assess-bitcoin/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。日本政府养老金投资基金(GPIF)正式宣布探索包括比特币在内的资产多元化机会，这标志着该基金传统上与更保守资产类别相关联的投资策略可能发生重大转变。GPIF目前处于信息请求阶段，将研究比特币和其他非传统资产的益处和风险。此举反映了该基金致力于拓宽其投资视野的努力。此外，日本日益推动比特币和加密货币投资的相关法规变化，使得投资基金能够直接持有比特币等加密货币。如果世界上最大的养老基金将比特币纳入其投资组合，这可能对其他国家和其投资战略产生重大影响。BTC目前交易价为$64,589。 <div>
<p>The Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF) of Japan, the world’s largest pension fund with assets totaling $1.5 trillion, has officially announced its initiative to explore diversification opportunities that include Bitcoin, alongside traditional investments such as gold and more unconventional assets like forests and farmland. This exploration marks a monumental potential pivot in the investment strategy of a fund traditionally associated with more conservative asset classes.</p>
<h2>Japan GPIF Seeks Information On Bitcoin</h2>
<p>According to a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.co.jp/news/articles/2024-03-19/SAKP1VT0AFB400" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">report</a> dated March 19, 2024, GPIF is in the initial phase of this exploration, focusing on an information request stage rather than signaling an imminent expansion of its investment portfolio. The fund currently diversifies its holdings across a vast array of assets, including domestic and international stocks and bonds, infrastructure, and real estate. With assets under management valued at approximately 225 trillion yen as of the end of December 2023, the GPIF&#8217;s interest in Bitcoin and other illiquid assets underscores a notable shift towards broadening its investment aperture.</p>

<p>The GPIF stated, &#8220;In addition to basic knowledge about the assets targeted for information provision, we are also seeking information on how overseas pension funds incorporate them into their portfolios and actual investment cases.&#8221; This reflects a methodical approach to understanding the potential benefits and risks associated with diversifying into less traditional and more volatile asset classes like Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Recent years have seen the GPIF actively seeking to enhance the sophistication and diversity of its portfolio. &#8220;Since the fall of 2022, a total of 56 active funds have been selected in North American, developed country, and Japanese stocks,&#8221; the GPIF noted, highlighting its ongoing efforts to refine its investment strategies. The inclusion of Bitcoin and other non-traditional assets would represent a further step in these <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/trading-bitcoin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">diversification</a> efforts.</p>
<p>However, the GPIF has cautiously noted, &#8220;This announcement is a request for information and does not indicate that the company will expand its investment targets in the future.&#8221; This statement clarifies that any decision to incorporate Bitcoin or other proposed assets into its investment strategy will depend on the outcomes of its current research phase.</p>

<p>This move by the GPIF comes amid broader regulatory changes in Japan regarding Bitcoin and crypto investments. Just one month prior to this announcement, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/japanese-government-to-ease-30-crypto-tax-requirement-a-good-move/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Japan&#8217;s administration</a>, led by Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, moved to enable investment funds to hold Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies directly. &#8220;The bill states that &#8216;measures will be taken to add crypto assets to the list of assets that can be acquired and held by investment limited partnerships,'&#8221; according to a statement from the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry.</p>
<p>The GPIF&#8217;s exploration of Bitcoin and alternative assets not only underscores the growing <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-etfs-see-record-1-billion-inflows/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">institutional interest</a> in Bitcoin, but is also in line with Japan&#8217;s regulatory advances aimed at integrating digital assets into the country&#8217;s economic framework. The potential inclusion of Bitcoin in the world&#8217;s largest pension fund would be huge news and could have implications for other countries and their investment strategies.</p>
<p>At press time, BTC traded at $64,589.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。XRP价格从$0.7450阻力开始下跌，难以保持在$0.5850支撑区域以上。价格在$0.650以下交易，并且已经跌破了100四小时简单移动平均线。有一个关键的下行趋势线形成，阻力位于$0.640。如果价格能在$0.6650阻力区域收盘，可能会开始新的上涨。如果下跌，支撑位于$0.5980和$0.5850，更下方支撑位于$0.5200。技术指标显示MACD和RSI都偏于熊市。 <div>
<p><em>XRP price started a downside correction from the $0.7450 resistance. The bulls are now struggling to keep the price above the $0.5850 support zone.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>XRP started a fresh decline after it failed to clear the $0.7450 resistance.</li>
<li>The price is now trading below $0.650 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There is a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.640 on the 4-hour chart of the XRP/USD pair (data source from Kraken).</li>
<li>The pair could start a fresh rally if there is a close above the $0.6650 resistance zone.</li>
</ul>
<h2>XRP Price Trims Gains</h2>
<p>After a steady increase, XRP price struggled to extend gains above the $0.750 resistance. The price started a downside correction from the $0.7442 high, like <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-extends-losses-3200/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ethereum</a> and <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-at-risk-65k/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin</a>.</p>
<p>There was a steady decline below the $0.700 and $0.665 support levels. The price even declined below the $0.600 support. A low was formed near $0.5874 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor increase above the $0.620 level.</p>
<p>The price spiked above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.7442 swing high to the $0.5874 low. However, the bears were active near $0.650. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.640 on the 4-hour chart of the XRP/USD pair.</p>
<p>Ripple’s token price is now trading below $0.620 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $0.640 zone. The first key resistance is near $0.6650 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.7442 swing high to the $0.5874 low, above which the price could rise toward the $0.70 resistance.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/XRP_Price_d9d9a4.png?resize=1024%2C461"><img alt="XRP Price Prediction" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-598594" height="461" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/XRP_Price_d9d9a4.png?resize=1024%2C461" width="1024" /></a></p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XRPUSD/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">XRPUSD on TradingView.com</a></p>
<p>A close above the $0.70 resistance zone could spark a strong increase. The next key resistance is near $0.7450. If the bulls remain in action above the $0.7450 resistance level, there could be a rally toward the $0.800 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.820 resistance.</p>
<h2>More Losses?</h2>
<p>If XRP fails to clear the $0.6650 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5980 zone.</p>
<p>The next major support is at $0.5850. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.5850 level, the price might accelerate lower. In the stated case, the price could retest the $0.520 support zone.</p>
<p>Technical Indicators</p>
<p>4-Hours MACD – The MACD for XRP/USD is now gaining pace in the bearish zone.</p>
<p>4-Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for XRP/USD is now below the 50 level.</p>

<title>PlanB’s Bitcoin Forecast: A Journey To $5 Million Per BTC In The Next Decade</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/planbs-bitcoin-forecast-a-journey-to-5-million/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/planbs-bitcoin-forecast-a-journey-to-5-million/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要: 这些信息是积极的。PlanB提出了关于比特币未来发展的预测，引起了加密社区的兴趣和讨论。根据S2F模型，2020-2024的减半周期预计将使比特币价格稳定在约5万美元左右。2024-2028周期将为比特币升至50万美元奠定基础，最终在2028-2032周期达到500万美元。虽然这些预测引起了争议，但PlanB指出，S2F模型虽然能指导总体趋势，但精确的未来价格预测存在较大误差。此外，文章还提到了比特币最新价格走势，显示了市场的技术分析和价格变动。 <div>
<p>PlanB, a popular name within the Bitcoin community, thanks to his Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model, has <a href="https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD/status/1769681310296035783?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">shared</a> the latest discourse on X, igniting a flurry of excitement and speculation. This discourse particularly highlights BTC&#8217;s potential journey through successive <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-sentiment-cools-price-rebound-soon/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">halving cycles</a>.</p>
<p>PlanB&#8217;s analysis, deeply rooted in the S2F model, presents a narrative for Bitcoin&#8217;s future. This model scrutinizes the correlation between an asset&#8217;s existing reserves (stock) and annual production (flow) and lays the groundwork for <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/planbs-market-cycle-analysis-bitcoin-gears-up-for-skyrocketing-beyond-100000/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">PlanB’s bold predictions</a>.</p>

<h2>Navigating Through Predictions: A Community Aweigh</h2>
<p>According to the model, the forthcoming halving cycle spanning 2020-2024 is expected to solidify Bitcoin&#8217;s price at around $50,000. But the real spectacle unfolds in the ensuing cycles, with<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-hits-support-65k/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> projections</a> setting the stage for Bitcoin to ascend to $500,000 in the 2024-2028 cycle, eventually reaching a monumental $5 million in the 2028-2032 cycle.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Stock-to-Flow 2020-2024 halving cycle: ~$50k
Stock-to-Flow 2024-2028 halving cycle: ~$500k
Stock-to-Flow 2028-2032 halving cycle: ~$5m
Yes, S2F = exponential growth, and it will continue IMO. <a href="https://t.co/rH1KmIyKSl" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/rH1KmIyKSl</a></p>
<p>— PlanB (@100trillionUSD) <a href="https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD/status/1769681310296035783?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">March 18, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The predictions made by PlanB have sparked interest and debate among the crypto community. Many are curious to see if Bitcoin will experience the forecasted substantial growth.</p>
<p>An X user responded to PlanB&#8217;s post, expressing hopefulness yet advising caution due to the limited number of data points that can&#8217;t definitively predict precise future prices, like an average of $500k from 2024 to 2028.</p>
<p>PlanB acknowledged this caution, pointing out that his predictions are based on three past halving events and the significant pre-halving period, suggesting that while the Stock-to-Flow model can guide the general trend, its accuracy comes with a considerable margin of error.</p>
<p>For instance, while the 2020-2024 period was projected to see an average of $55k, the actual figure was around $33k.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Very true. Only 3 halvings (2012, 2016 and 2020) plus the crucial pre-halving period (where BTC S2F grew from below 1 to ~4). And S2F is only for general direction, of course, and with wide error margin (for example: prediction 2020-2024 was 55k but in reality ~33k).</p>
<p>— PlanB (@100trillionUSD) <a href="https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD/status/1769684174137405648?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">March 18, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Additionally, another user in the conversation, known as Phoenix of Crypto, <a href="https://x.com/PhoenixBTC7/status/1769688309456912892?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">remarked</a> that while PlanB&#8217;s projection might seem &#8220;overly optimistic,&#8221; the true outcome remains to be seen, emphasizing the need for patience.</p>
<p>This user highlighted the uncertainty surrounding <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/planbs-triple-bitcoin-forecast-a-pre-halving-surge/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin&#8217;s future</a>, especially considering the potential impacts of ETFs and widespread adoption, signaling an open-minded but watchful approach to market developments.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Latest Price Action</h2>
<p>Bitcoin is undergoing a notable decline, having decreased by 7.5% over the last week. This downward trajectory has extended into the last 24 hours, with the cryptocurrency dropping an additional 1.5%. Despite these setbacks, Bitcoin&#8217;s trading price remains at $67,167 at the time of writing.</p>

<p>This range is seen as a possible pivot point for the market&#8217;s direction, concurrently noting the substantial selling activity on leading platforms such as Coinbase and Binance.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin Price Faces Resistance</h2>
<p>Bitcoin price attempted a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-hits-support-65k/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">fresh increase</a> above the $65,500 zone. BTC climbed above the $67,200 and $68,000 levels. However, the bears were active near the $69,000 zone.</p>
<p>A high was formed at $68,898 and the price is now moving lower. There was a move below the $67,500 support zone. The price declined below the 50% Fib retracement level of the recovery wave from the $64,555 swing low to the $68,898 high.</p>

<title>Ether.fi $210M Airdrop Sparks Market Turbulence, ETHFI Value Drops By 35%</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要: 这些信息是积极的。文章介绍了Ether.fi的治理代币ETHFI的空投活动，吸引了约20000名参与者。虽然ETHFI的价值在空投后出现了35%的下跌，但分配策略旨在确保更广泛和更公平地分发代币。此外，Ether.fi的净存款和总锁定价值都呈现出显著增长，但活跃用户数量有所波动。总体而言，ETHFI代币的空投吸引了很多关注，而Ether.Fi生态系统中ETHFI的长期潜力和影响尚待充分实现。 <div>
<p>ETHFI, the governance token of the decentralized liquid staking protocol Ether.fi, debuted for $4.13 following its distribution through its <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-open-interest-40-crash/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">airdrop </a>on March 18. </p>
<p>However, since the $210 million airdrop, the value of ETHFI has experienced a significant decline, plummeting over 35% to its current trading price of $3.05, according to CoinGecko <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ether-fi" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">data</a>.</p>
<h2>ETHFI Airdrop Attracts 20,000 Participants</h2>
<p>Market expert Tom Wan has provided a <a href="https://x.com/tomwanhh/status/1769706615744118948?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">summary </a>of the ETHFI airdrop. Out of the total supply of 16.8 million ETHFI tokens, approximately 28% have been claimed by participants. </p>

<p>The airdrop attracted around 20,000 claimers, showcasing considerable interest in the token distribution. Notably, the top wallets, accounting for 1.67% of the total distribution, have the potential to receive between 10,000 and 25,000 <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-price-soars-10-in-reaction-to-explosive-2367-shib-burn-surge/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">ETHFI tokens</a>, reflecting substantial holdings.</p>
<img alt="Ether.fi " class="wp-image-598577 size-large" height="469" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot_80.jpg?w=860&#038;resize=860%2C469" width="860" />
<p>Most claimers, comprising approximately 67% of participants, are expected to receive a lower allocation of ETHFI tokens, ranging from 175 to 500. </p>
<p>This distribution strategy aims to ensure a broader and more equitable dispersion of the tokens among participants. However, an interesting observation is that 76% of claimers have transferred their ETHFI tokens to other wallets, indicating a potential desire for liquidity or <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-sentiment-cools-price-rebound-soon/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">trading activities</a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is noteworthy that 38% of the token receivers are new wallets, suggesting an expansion of the ETHFI user base as of May 1, 2023. This influx of new participants showcases a growing interest in the governance and utility offered by Ether.Fi&#8217;s protocol.</p>
<h2>Ether.fi Witnesses Surge In Total Value Locked</h2>
<p>Ether.fi has experienced notable growth in net deposits and Total Value Locked (TVL), as evidenced by <a href="https://tokenterminal.com/terminal/projects/etherfi" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">data </a>provided by Token Terminal. However, the platform has faced fluctuations in its active user base. </p>
<p>According to Token Terminal, net deposits on Ether.fi have significantly increased, reaching $2.99 billion over the past 30 days alone. This marks a significant growth rate of 136.9%.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the TVL on Ether.fi has mirrored the surge in <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-approaches-risky-territory-as-halving-event-draws-near/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">net deposits</a>, which also amount to $2.99 billion over the same 30-day period. This metric represents the total value of assets, predominantly cryptocurrency, locked within the protocol. </p>
<p>However, while Ether.fi has witnessed robust growth in net deposits and TVL, the platform has experienced fluctuations in its active user base. Daily active users have shown a considerable decline of 54.3% over the past 30 days, currently standing at 506. </p>
<img alt="Ether.fi " class="wp-image-598578 size-large" height="418" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot_81.jpg?w=579&#038;resize=579%2C418" width="579" />
<p>Similarly, weekly active users have experienced a more moderate decline of 3.5%, currently standing at 5,780. This suggests that while there has been a slight reduction in user engagement every week, a significant portion of the user base remains actively involved with the protocol.</p>
<p>The most substantial decline in user activity is observed in monthly active users, with a notable drop of 68.9% over the past 30 days. The figure currently stands at 14,740 users. </p>

<p>Overall, the distribution of the ETHFI token through the airdrop has garnered significant attention and participation. At the same time, the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-threatens-to-retreat-to-60000-as-bulls-seek-solid-ground/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">token&#8217;s value</a> has experienced a decline since its initial listing, the long-term potential and impact of ETHFI within the Ether.Fi ecosystems are yet to be fully realized.</p>

<title>Is Ripple Behind The XRP Price Crash? Massive Selling Spree Sparks Concern</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/ripple-behind-xrp-price-crash/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/ripple-behind-xrp-price-crash/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的<br />文章讨论了Ripple最近转移240万XRP代币到一个未知地址的行为，引发了人们对XRP价格崩溃的担忧。进行的两次交易分别发生在3月5日和3月13日，而XRP价格在3月11日曾经上涨至0.74美元后出现急剧下跌。尽管有人认为Ripple的销售行为可能导致了价格下降，但也有人表示疑问。目前XRP价格持续下跌，市场对于这一情况的讨论仍在继续。 <div>
<p>Ripple’s occasional sale of XRP tokens has always been pinpointed as one reason for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-price-action-legal-expert/" rel="nofollow">XRP’s tepid price action</a>. Once again, the crypto firm’s recent offloading of a significant amount of XRP has raised concerns <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-will-remain-flat-even-if-bitcoin-roars/" rel="nofollow">about its negative effect</a> on the crypto token. </p>
<h2>Ripple Offloads 240 Million XRP</h2>
<p><a href="https://xrpscan.com/account/rBg2FuZT91C52Nny68houguJ4vt5x1o91m" rel="nofollow">On-chain data</a> shows that Ripple transferred a total of 240 million XRP tokens to an unknown address in two separate transactions. The first transaction occurred on March 5, when it sent 100 million XRP to the address in question. Then, on March 13, the Ripple wallet again transferred 140 million XRP to this address. </p>

<p>These transactions have raised eyebrows, and members of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-cto-burn-xrp-holdings/" rel="nofollow">XRP community</a> are contemplating whether these sales might have been the reason XRP’s price crashed recently. Notably, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-is-primed-for-growth/">the crypto token rose</a> to as high as $0.74 on March 11 before seeing a sharp correction. </p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-price-to-hit-3-4-crypto-expert-reveals-when/" rel="nofollow">XRP’s price</a> crashed on March 5, the day the first transaction was carried out. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that the crypto token, which was trading as high as $0.65 on the day, dropped to as low as $0.55 on the same day. However, it remains uncertain whether or not Ripple’s action was directly responsible for this price dip.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/39000-xrp-price-to-hit-220/" rel="nofollow">XRP’s price</a> was pretty stable on the day the second transaction occurred, although it was still declining from its weekly high of $0.7, recorded on March 11. The impact of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/ripple-xrp-sales-jump-in-2023/">Ripple’s XRP sales</a> on the market continues to be heavily debated among those in the<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrps-underperformance-ruffles-feathers-as-community-asks-ripple-to-do-something-about-price/" rel="nofollow"> XRP community</a>. </p>
<p>Pro-XRP crypto YouTuber Jerry Hall <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-expert-xrp-price-suppressed/" rel="nofollow">previously claimed</a> that Ripple was suppressing XRP’s price with its monthly sales. However, there has also been a <a href="https://blockworks.co/news/ripple-xrp-sec-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">report</a> that Ripple’s sale doesn’t impact prices on crypto exchanges. </p>
<h2>If Not Ripple, Then Who?</h2>
<p>Ripple’s price action defies logic, especially considering that the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-ceo-success-for-xrp/" rel="nofollow">token’s fundamentals </a>and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/parabolic-breakout-xrp-price/" rel="nofollow">technical analysis</a> suggest it is well primed for a parabolic move. That is why talks about possible market manipulation continue to persist. It is also understandable that all fingers instantly point to Ripple since they are the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/top-10-xrp-wallets-11-supply/" rel="nofollow">largest XRP holders</a>. </p>

<p>However, if Ripple is indeed not responsible for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-will-remain-flat-even-if-bitcoin-roars/" rel="nofollow">XRP’s stagnant price action</a>, then there needs to be another explanation for why XRP has continued to underperform. Although the crypto token has continued to rank in the top 10 largest crypto tokens by market cap, it is worth mentioning that it is one of few tokens that has a negative year-to-date (YTD) gain. </p>
<p>At the time of writing, XRP is trading at around $0.61, up in the last 24 hours according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xrp/" rel="nofollow">data</a> from CoinMarketCap. </p>

<title>Bitcoin Has Undergone This Bearish Structure Change, Analyst Explains</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-undergone-bearish-analyst-explains/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。最近比特币的Coinbase溢价差持续为负值，表明大型美国实体正在出售比特币。这反映在比特币价格下跌近9％至约67300美元。分析显示，美国机构交易商今年推动了价格行动，当前的熊市结构可能使价格无法积累太多上行动力。愿景不明朗。 <div>
<p>An analyst has explained that the recent trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap suggests a significant change in the asset&#8217;s structure.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap Has Continued To Be Negative</h2>
<p>In a new <a href="https://twitter.com/JA_Maartun/status/1769722321609101793" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, analyst Maartunn discussed how the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap is still negative. The &#8220;Coinbase Premium Gap&#8221; here refers to a metric that tracks the difference between the Bitcoin prices listed on cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase (USD pair) and Binance (USDT pair).</p>

<p>This indicator&#8217;s value provides hints about how the behavior of the former&#8217;s userbase currently differs from that of the latter platform.</p>
<p>Below is the chart shared by the analyst that reveals the trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap since the start of the year.</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="2580" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GI9REFQXAAA9MLp?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096" width="4096" /></p>

<p>As the graph shows, the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap had been mostly positive as Bitcoin had gone through its journey from $44,000 to beyond the $73,000 level.</p>
<p>This would imply that the price listed on the exchange was higher than on Binance during this period. Such a trend naturally suggests that the buying pressure on the former was greater than on the latter.</p>
<p>Coinbase is widely known to be the preferred platform of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/institutionals-bitcoin-fomo-coinbase-premium/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">US-based institutional investors</a>, while Binance has global traffic. Thus, the green positive premium values would imply these large American entities had been buying and supporting the rally.</p>
<p>Recently, however, the indicator&#8217;s value turned negative as these investors took to selling instead. Since then, the metric has continued to assume such values. Alongside this selloff, the BTC price has experienced a notable decline.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap followed a similar pattern during the first month or so of the year. In the first 10 days of January, the metric had been positive as buying had occurred in anticipation of the<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-etfs-see-record-1-billion-inflows/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs)</a>. Still, after the ETFs had been approved, the indicator had turned negative.</p>

<p>The red premium values had maintained for a few weeks, during which the cryptocurrency price had struggled. Based on this pattern and the recent trend, it would seem that American institutional traders have driven the price action this year.</p>
<p>As such, so long as the current bearish structure in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap exists, it&#8217;s possible that the price may not be able to amass too much upward momentum.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>At the end of the positive Coinbase Premium Gap streak, Bitcoin had been able to achieve a new all-time high above $73,800, but as traders have switched to selling on the platform, the coin has dropped almost 9%, with its price now trading around $67,300.</p>

<title>Profit-Taking Panic, Short-Term Bitcoin Holders Sell Off – What’s Next For BTC?</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/profit-taking-panic-short-term-bitcoin-holders/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/profit-taking-panic-short-term-bitcoin-holders/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。最近的区块链数据显示了一个重要趋势：持有比特币不到五个月的投资者正在大量获利。这种短期持有者为了获利而清仓的现象反映了先前牛市高峰时期的模式。此外，引入了BTC现货交易所交易基金（ETF）可能会平衡市场动态，缓解短期持有者获利行为的不良影响。预计RIAs市场的资金流入将带来积极需求冲击，增加比特币的投资。同时，BTC的供需动态显示出不断增长的需求对减少供应的压力。<br /> <div>
<p>Recent on-chain data <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptoquant_com/status/1769516442729533668?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">highlighted</a> a significant trend: a wave of profit-taking by investors who have held Bitcoin (BTC) for less than five months.</p>
<p>As detailed by CryptoQuant&#8217;s latest data, this phenomenon is not just a random market movement but an echo of patterns observed at the zeniths of previous bull markets.</p>

<h2>Profit-Taking Among Short-Term Bitcoin Holders Signals Market Shift</h2>
<p>According to CryptoQuant, the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), a key metric in evaluating the profit and loss of Bitcoin transactions over a specific period, showcases a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-sentiment-cools-price-rebound-soon/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">pronounced uptick</a> indicative of widespread profit realization.</p>
<p>This tendency among short-term holders to liquidate their holdings for gains parallels historical market peaks and suggests a critical juncture for Bitcoin.</p>
<img alt="Bitcoin Short Term Holder metric. " height="750" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/card_img/1769293033458270208/-HJtr8Ai?format=jpg&amp;name=medium" width="1199" />
<p>Crypto Dan, a seasoned market analyst, emphasized the significance of this trend, stating, &#8220;This movement is something that only happens once every few years,&#8221; highlighting the uniqueness and possible consequences of the present market trends.</p>

<p>&#8220;In relation to this adjustment, if we look at the SOPR, there was a big movement related to profit realization by short-term holders who held <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BTC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#BTC</a> for less than 5 months.&#8221;

<h2>New Market Forces At Play: ETFs Inflow Set To Rebalance The Equation</h2>
<p>While the SOPR metric might signal alarm bells reminiscent of past <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-hits-support-65k/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">bull market peaks</a>, the crypto landscape is underpinned by factors that could mitigate the traditional outcomes of such profit-taking.</p>
<p>Among these is the recent introduction of a BTC spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). This new avenue for Bitcoin investment introduces a complex layer to the market&#8217;s dynamics, potentially cushioning any adverse effects of short-term holders&#8217; profit-taking activities.</p>
<p>Dan concluded by <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/65f6b4e4afc8f17fcb7e6924-BTC-short-term-investors-took-large-profits?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=sns&amp;utm_campaign=quicktake&amp;utm_content=crypto-dan" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">noting</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>But considering the BTC spot ETF and potential additional inflows from institutions and individuals, it is difficult to judge it as simply a signal of the peak of a bull market. After a short-term correction period, it&#8217;s very likely that we will see a strong further bull in 2024.</p></blockquote>
<p>CoinShares Head of Research, James Butterfill, <a href="https://blog.coinshares.com/the-bitcoin-demand-shock-5be12c1738b3" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">provides</a> a further layer of analysis, suggesting an imminent &#8220;positive demand shock&#8221; for Bitcoin. According to Butterfill, the delay in making spot Bitcoin ETFs accessible to the Registered Investment Advisors (RIA) market — a sector managing around $50 trillion in assets — is set to end.</p>
<p>With RIAs requiring three months of<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-threatens-to-retreat-to-60000-as-bulls-seek-solid-ground/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> trading data</a> before including new ETFs in their portfolios, the market is on the cusp of witnessing a substantial influx of new investments into Bitcoin. &#8220;If 10% of RIAs chose to invest 1% of their portfolios, this could result in approximately $50 billion in additional inflows,&#8221; Butterfill elaborated, highlighting the scale of potential market impact.</p>
<p>Moreover, the current supply-demand dynamics within the Bitcoin <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-approaches-risky-territory-as-halving-event-draws-near/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">market are skewed</a> towards increasing demand against decreasing supply.</p>

<p>The daily demand for BTC, fueled by the trade of spot BTC ETFs and the average production of new coins, underscores a growing discrepancy that ETF issuers are filling by <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-crashes-dip-to-65000-triggers-over-400-million-liquidation-avalanche/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">tapping into the secondary market</a>.</p>
<p>This scenario is evidenced by a dramatic decrease in OTC desk coin holdings, a direct consequence of ETF-driven demand, according to Butterfill.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Whales Enter Full Accumulation Mode: Here’s How Much BTC They Pulled From Exchanges</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-whales-btc-exchanges/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章指出上周比特币价格波动，由于大量比特币从交易所撤出，大型投资者预计价格将进一步上涨。数据显示，过去一周已有21,401枚比特币从交易所转移。另外，13名新的持有超过1,000个比特币的大鲸鱼加入。此外，3月15日比特币从交易所取出的金额达到5.75亿美元，是自2023年5月以来的最高点。尽管市场信心略有下降，但通过大量比特币的撤离来看，大鲸鱼似乎在为持续的涨势做准备。 <div>
<p>The Bitcoin price movement last week revealed a series of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-crashes-dip-to-65000-triggers-over-400-million-liquidation-avalanche/">ups and downs</a>, from starting the week at a new all-time high of  $73,780 to crashing 12% in the days after to reach below $65,000. Crypto data analysts have spotted massive amounts of Bitcoin being withdrawn from major exchanges during the period of uncertainty, indicating that large investors anticipate further price appreciation. </p>
<p>According to a social media post by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, the total BTC balance on crypto exchanges fell by over 21,400 in the past week, with the creation of 13 new whales, each holding over 1,000 BTC.</p>
<h2>BTC Withdrawal From Exchanges</h2>
<p>Bitcoin crossed over $73,700 last week to register a new all-time high but has struggled to gain a footing above the price level. Interestingly, it would seem the new all-time high sparked a wave of profit-taking from some investors. However, on-chain and exchange data indicate Bitcoin is still undergoing a bullish sentiment from some investors, particularly large investors. </p>

<p>Crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted this bull accumulation pattern in a post on his social media platform X. According to a Glassnode chart shared by the analyst, the total amount of BTC on exchanges has been on a free-fall since the middle of January. Notably, the total BTC balance saw a brief increase in the first few days of March before resuming a free-fall on March 5. In the past week alone, 21,401 BTC were moved off crypto exchanges. </p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Similarly, the crypto analytics platform IntoTheBlock noted this outflow pattern during the week. According to ITB, BTC withdrawal from crypto exchanges reached its highest point this year on March 15. Interestingly, $750 million worth of Bitcoin was withdrawn on this day, the highest since May 2023.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Over $750m <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">$BTC</a> was withdrawn from exchanges yesterday, the highest since May 2023. The majority of these withdrawals originate from Bitfinex ($524m) and Kraken ($130m) <a href="https://t.co/8d3eIJROhv" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/8d3eIJROhv</a></p>
<p>— IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) <a href="https://twitter.com/intotheblock/status/1768592828362289234?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">March 15, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<h2>What Does This Mean For Bitcoin?</h2>
<p>The Bitcoin ecosystem has witnessed serious money on the move since the beginning of the year, leading to a strong price surge for the cryptocurrency. However, this rally has since slowed down to spark a price correction, with market sentiment <a href="https://x.com/ali_charts/status/1769049306827272609?s=20" rel="nofollow">reaching the most negative sentiment</a> toward BTC since December 2023. Bitcoin is currently trading at $68,201, down by 3.44% in the past seven days. </p>

<p>After such a strong surge in price, it’s normal for the momentum to slow down as the market consolidates and decides on the next move. While momentum has slowed, the overall trend for <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-hits-support-65k/">Bitcoin remains bullish</a>. </p>
<p>Judging by the massive amounts of Bitcoin pulled from exchanges recently, it looks like whales are gearing up for a continued rally. <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-a-decades-long-investment-ceo-says-despite-recent-downturn/" rel="nofollow">Bitcoin is now showing signs</a> of a rally, and is now up by 5% in the past 24 hours. </p>

<title>Arbitrum Whales Are HODLing; Why Are ARB Prices Tanking?</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/arbitrum-whales-hodling-arb-prices-tanking/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/arbitrum-whales-hodling-arb-prices-tanking/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />最近解锁的ARB触发了抛售担忧，但Lookonchain数据显示出不同的情况。仅有58百万ARB被11个大型投资者发送到交易所，显示出其他鲸鱼持有着他们的ARB，对项目的未来充满信心。尽管价格下跌，但持有者保持乐观，而Dencun升级对Arbitrum的发展也有利。 Arbitrum继续领先于第二层扩展解决方案，在总锁定价值方面胜过Optimism。 <div>
<p>While the recent unlocking of ARB triggered fears of a sell-off, Lookonchain data suggests a different story. On March 18, the analytics platform <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1769586523639562691" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">showed</a> that a mere 58 million ARB, representing only a tiny portion of the 1.1 billion tokens unlocked on March 16, were sent to exchanges by just 11 large-scale investors, commonly called &#8220;whales.&#8221;</p>
<img alt="ARB whales transferred coins to exchanges | Source: ARBUSDT on Binance, TradingView" class="size-full wp-image-598523" height="668" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GI7Vb57aAAA61XH.png?resize=1024%2C668" width="1024" />
<h2>Are Whales Bullish On ARB? </h2>
<p>This transfer indicates that despite some profit-taking, other whales are HODLing on to their ARB, reflecting continued confidence in the project&#8217;s future. </p>
<p>On March 16, Arbitrum <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://token.unlocks.app/arbitrum" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">sent</a> 1.1 billion ARB to investors, team members, and advisors in a &#8220;Cliff Unlock.&#8221; Analysts describe a &#8220;Cliff Unlock&#8221; as a situation in which all allocated tokens for that event are released simultaneously.</p>

<p>Arbitrum chose to release all tokens at once. 673.5 million were sent to advisors and the team. Meanwhile, the remainder, 438.25 million, was sent to investors. The unlocking event, as expected, was a source of concern that some receivers would choose to sell in the secondary market. </p>
<p>As expected, ARB prices have decreased, reflecting the general sentiment across the crypto market board. So far, ARB is down 24% from March 2024 highs. However, what&#8217;s clear is that the uptrend remains, and buyers remain in charge despite the selling pressure.</p>

<p>Based purely on price action, ARB bulls have a chance if prices are above the $1.6 to $1.65 support zone. Conversely, any upswing above this level might drive prices to the upper end of the range at around $2.20. Further upswings will continue the sharp expansion from October 2023. At the time of writing, ARB is up 125% from Q4 2023 lows.</p>
<h2>Arbitrum To Benefit From Dencun, Cementing Its Layer-2 Dominance</h2>
<p>Lookonchain data shows that only a few tokens were sent to exchanges less than a week after the unlocking event, suggesting investors and whales are bullish about the project. </p>
<p>L2Beat data <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://l2beat.com/scaling/summary" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">shows</a> that Arbitrum, a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, is the largest in that category by total value locked (TVL). By March 18, Arbitrum managed $14.7 billion worth of assets, nearly 2X that of Optimism.</p>
<img alt="Arbitrum TVL | Source: L2Beat" class="size-full wp-image-598521" height="434" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot591.png?resize=893%2C434" width="893" />
<p>While ARB is under pressure, the broader Ethereum and crypto community remains bullish. Last week, the &#8220;Dencun&#8221; update was released to the mainnet. </p>

<p>This update is significant as it further slashes transaction fees, making layer-2s, including Arbitrum, more attractive for users. This upgrade is especially appealing to developers and users seeking to enjoy the high on-chain activity on Ethereum without struggling with high gas fees and low scalability. As Layer-2 solutions find adoption, Arbitrum could benefit from this influx.</p>

<title>Arbitrum Token Sell-Off: Whales Transfer $58M To Exchanges Following Unlock, ARB Price Reacts</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。Layer 2协议Arbitrum (ARB)解锁了11亿个令牌，导致其本地令牌价值下跌。11只大鲸鱼将价值5800万美元的ARB令牌存入交易所出售。Wintermute交易公司连续两天存入ARB令牌，可能用于出售。ARB令牌自其创下的2.39美元历史高点以来已经下跌了29%。解锁后，ARB的价格出现了3%的上涨，但循序渐进地下跌，21天后达到-21%的低点。然而，约在25天后，价格开始大幅恢复，超过解锁当天水平19%。过去的模式显示，虽然ARB可能面临解锁后的初期压力，但在接下来的几周内可能会出现恢复和积极的价格走势。 <div>
<p>On Saturday, March 16, the Layer 2 protocol Arbitrum (ARB) unlocked 1.1 billion <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/arbitrum/arbitrum-beats-ethereum-and-solana-with-119-surge-in-nft-sales-nft-resurgence-on-the-horizon/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">ARB tokens</a> as part of its 2024 roadmap. This event led to a significant decline in the native token&#8217;s value, with losses of up to 18% reported over the past week. </p>
<p>In the past 24 hours, more whales have been sending ARB tokens to exchanges for selling, indicating a potential further drop in the protocol&#8217;s prices. This token unlocking marks the beginning of a four-year phased process, releasing a specific number of tokens every four weeks until 2027.</p>
<h2>11 Whales Dump $58 Million Worth Of ARB Tokens</h2>
<p>Following the massive unlocking of ARB tokens, analysis firm Lookonchain <a href="https://x.com/lookonchain/status/1769586523639562691?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">revealed </a>that 11 whales deposited 34 million ARB tokens (equivalent to $58 million) into exchanges. </p>
<p>Additionally, on-chain data provider &#8220;The Data Nerd&#8221; <a href="https://x.com/OnchainDataNerd/status/1769381905244529099?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">noted </a>that trading firm Wintermute has been continuously depositing ARB tokens for the past 48 hours, potentially for selling purposes. </p>
<p>The data provider notes that digital asset trading firm Wintermute now holds only 7.22 million ARB tokens worth $12.35 million, indicating that they have already deposited or sold $18.12 million worth of ARB over the past few days.</p>

<p>The ARB token has been on a 29% downtrend since reaching its all-time high (ATH) of $2.39 on June 12, 2024. Following the unlock event, ARB traded as high as $1.96 but dipped to $1.61 within 48 hours. </p>
<p>The token has managed to reclaim the $1.68 level despite being in the red zone over the past 24 hours if the price drops further, ARB&#8217;s potential support walls are identified at $1.56, $1.46, and potentially as low as $1.32.</p>
<h2>Arbitrum Post-Unlock Journey </h2>
<p>NewsBTC <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/arbitrum/arbitrum-arb-faces-potential-selling-pressure-as-1-billion-tokens-become-unlocked-in-march/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">reported</a> that there has been only one previous unlock event for ARB tokens. On the first day after the unlock, ARB experienced a 3% increase, indicating positive market sentiment and initial demand. </p>
<p>However, the token&#8217;s price gradually declined, reaching a low of -21% approximately 21 days after the unlock event. Interestingly, around the 25-day mark, the price began significantly recovering, surging by 19% above the unlock-day level. </p>
<p>These patterns suggest that while Arbitrum may face initial downward pressure post-unlock, there is potential for recovery and positive price movement in the following weeks.</p>

<p>The future trajectory of ARB&#8217;s price action remains uncertain despite experiencing a 15% drop from its first unlock day. Drawing from the past <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/uniswap/uniswap-expands-reach-deploys-v2-protocol-on-six-new-chains-including-arbitrum-and-polygon/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">unlock event</a>, if historical patterns hold, there may be a further 6% decrease, aligning with the previous 21% drop observed 25 days after the first Arbitrum unlock event. </p>
<p>This hypothetical scenario would place Arbitrum at $1.57, indicating a favorable mid-term <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/arbitrum/buy-sell-trade-arbitrum-network/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">uptrend structure</a>.</p>
<p>However, it is crucial to note that past patterns do not guarantee identical outcomes in current price trading. Nevertheless, analyzing historical data can provide valuable insights and help understand and assess potential price movements.</p>

<title>Solana Surpasses Ethereum In Major Metric Amid Surge Above $200</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-ethereum-surge-200/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-ethereum-surge-200/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。Solana在加密货币领域变得越来越流行，网络活动超过了以太坊。3月16日，Solana的网络活动大幅增加，超过了以太坊的日交易量。网络容量达到极限，导致交易失败和ping时间增加。Solana的价格也在上涨，市值稳步接近1000亿美元。随着对Solana的兴趣和需求增加，其在市值排名上成功跻身第四位，并创下了全球谷歌搜索兴趣的新高。 <div>
<p>Solana has recently become one of the trendiest cryptocurrencies in the space, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-sol-massive-870-premium/">capturing the interest </a>of both crypto investors and enthusiasts in the space. The popular cryptocurrency has witnessed a significant <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-sol-transaction-volume-breaks-the-charts/" rel="nofollow">surge in network activity</a>, surpassing even that of Ethereum, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. </p>
<h2>Solana Outpaces Ethereum Network Activity</h2>
<p>On March 16, Solana experienced a major increase in its overall network activity, pushing its capacity to its limits amidst the growing demands. The network had surged past <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-ethereum-trading-volume-over-40-billion/" rel="nofollow">Ethereum’s total trading volume</a> and exceeded its daily trading volume by more than $1.1 billion, according to <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Solana" rel="nofollow">data</a> by DefilLama.   </p>

<p>Specifically, Solana’s 24-hour <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana-defi-landscape-thrives-with-record-11-billion-trading-volume/">trading volume</a> had recorded almost $3 billion, surging past Ethereum’s daily volume of $2.04 billion. During the surge, the network witnessed an unprecedented amount of trading activities, which resulted in failed transactions and a surge in ping times. </p>
<p>As <a href="https://explorer.solana.com/" rel="nofollow">highlighted</a> by Solana Validator, the cryptocurrency network’s ping time on March 18, had jumped to a staggering 46 seconds, causing about a 30% to 40% failed transactions. The validator’s report also revealed a steady and rapid increase in <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-transaction-volumes-700-200/" rel="nofollow">Solanan’s transaction count</a>, recording over 276 million transactions at the time of writing, with about 2,107 transactions per second. </p>
<p>This rise in <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/from-outage-to-recovery-solana-price-bounces-back-with-network-restart-in-full-swing/">Solana’s network activity</a> has been attributed to the surge in interest in <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/god-candle-solana-meme-coin/">Solana-based meme coins</a>. On Thursday, March 14, degens eagerly sought after a new meme coin called <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/meme-coin/introducing-book-of-meme-bome-the-latest-1-billion-crypto-sensation/">Book of Meme (BOME)</a>, which had experienced an unprecedented bullish spike that triggered its market capitalization to rise from almost zero to a staggering $1.45 billion. </p>
<p>During these periods, the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-price-will-climb-to-750/">price of Solana</a> also rallied alongside, witnessing an unexpected price surge that propelled it by more than 30% in the past week. The cryptocurrency has been on a steady momentum since the beginning of the year, displaying slight <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/company/solana-price-drops-as-altcoin-market-falters-is-it-too-late-to-buy-sol/">price corrections</a> before continuing on its upward trajectory. </p>
<h2>SOL Price Rides The Bullish Wave</h2>
<p>Amidst Solana’s burgeoning popularity and rising transaction volumes, the cryptocurrency saw a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/sol-price-crosses-200/">price increase to more than $200</a>, reflecting a daily surge of approximately 8.9%, at the time of writing. The cryptocurrency’s <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-market-cap-1000-crypto-fund-ceo/">market capitalization</a> is also up by 11.10%, recording over $89 billion and steadily closing towards the $100 billion mark. </p>

<p>Due to its overwhelming network activities and <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solanas-biggest-memecoin-gains-681000-in-3-days-as-more-investors-bet-on-its-popularity/">growing popularity</a>, Solana has successfully gained the position of the 4th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-chasing-bnb-chain-race-to-5-market-dominance-heats-up/">overtaking BNB Chain (BNB)</a> by more than four billion, according to CoinMarketCap. </p>
<p>Moreover, the cryptocurrency has <a href="https://x.com/solanafloor/status/1769599178013823394?s=46" rel="nofollow">reached</a> peak levels globally in terms of Google search interest,  hitting a new all-time high. This surge has been attributed to the increasing interest and demand for the popular digital asset. </p>

<title>Solana Memecoin Presale Gone Wrong: Creator Accidentally Burns $10M, Whale Makes Huge Profit</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。新的Solana基于项目Slerf (SLERF)在推出后遭遇了问题，大部分代币供应在意外中被烧毁。项目的发起人在试图烧毁流动性池中的代币时出现错误，导致预售参与者的代币也被烧毁。鲸鱼利用这一情况赚取了数百万美元，引发社区的质疑。发起人承诺寻找方式来偿还预售参与者，但SLERF的价值在发布后波动不定。 <div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A new <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-tokens-among-top-gainers-jup-and-wen-soar-over-12-wif-hits-new-ath/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Solana-based</a> memecoin launched today, becoming the talk of the town, and whales have noticed it. However, the reasons behind this might be different from what everybody expects.</p>
<p>Since its launch, Slerf (SLERF), the newest Solana-based project, has been trending for all the wrong reasons. The project successfully raised $10 million during its presale and saw most of the token supply burned by accident.</p>



<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Solana Memecoin Launch Sees Millions Gone</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Just a few hours ago, the Slerf creator and the presale investors were full of excitement and expectation as the token’s launch approached. Everything appeared normal as the project’s X account <a href="https://twitter.com/Slerfsol/status/1769620303229952445" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> it had successfully burned $10.8 million worth of SLERF.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">For context, the project’s website states that the “slerfnomics” included a total supply yet to be determined, with 50% of the tokens to be sent into the Liquidity Pool (LP) and 50% for the presale participant’s airdrop. Additionally, the tokens in the LP would be burned at launch, and ownership would be revoked.</p>
<p><img alt="slerf, memecoin, sol" class="size-large wp-image-598533 aligncenter" height="310" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Captura-de-Pantalla-2024-03-18-a-las-7.41.15-a.-m.png?w=860&#038;resize=860%2C310" width="860" /></p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">However, investors seemed confused about the amount burned and where the airdrop tokens would come from. Before realizing their mistake, the creator explained that the airdrop to the presale participants wasn’t done before the burn because “it was the safest way.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The community quickly <a href="https://x.com/devtonic_sol/status/1769620999212028259?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">realized</a> that something had gone wrong, as it seemed the project’s team had no tokens left for the airdrop. The creator realized the mistake shortly after and announced it on X while apologizing.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Guys I fucked up. I burned the LP and the tokens that were set aside for the airdrop,” the <a href="https://twitter.com/Slerfsol/status/1769628592315748403" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> read. He further explained that the mistake was a “simple mindless misclick” while burning the LP.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It was further explained that after the first attempt to <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/shiba-inu-mania-price-surges-60-as-burn-rate-heats-up-by-over-22000/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">burn</a> the tokens failed, the creator checked the Sol incinerator and couldn’t see the LP tokens. As a result, he decided to clean the wallet of the “shitcoins” sent there. This action accidentally burned the presale token’s supply alongside the other tokens.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The mistake proved irreversible as the minting authority had already been revoked. Neither the creator nor the developers could access the burned tokens or mint new ones for the presale participants.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">From Sloths To Whales: Millions Made In 12 Minutes</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Whales took the opportunity to profit big on this Solana-based memecoin drama, as reported by Lookonchain.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The blockchain research platform <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1769663277561430111" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">revealed</a> that a whale wallet with over $32 million worth of SOL spent $606,000 (3,024 SOL) to buy 1.7 million SLERF. This wallet had never bought any tokens, and its newly acquired SLERF accounted for $1.5 million in unrealized profits a couple of hours ago.</p>

<p></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A different whale wallet spent 9,894 SOL (worth $1.98 million) to buy almost 70 million SLERF immediately after opening trading. In 12 minutes, the trader sold the memecoin for 25,001 SOL (worth around $5 million) and made over $3 million <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/pepe-whale-makes-8-13m-in-profit-as-bullish-rally-continues/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">in profit</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">However, these transactions raised the alarms of the presale investor and the community. Doubts of the “accidental burn of tokens” being much more than a mistake are high, as replies to the post suggest.  Many users believe these movements to be from “insiders” and not “lucky people.”</p>

He also stated his principal concern was to make things right for those who saw their investment vanish.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, he committed to finding a way to refund the presale participants. As of this writing, Slerf is live on X Space, asking the community for suggestions on how to repay them.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The SLERF pumped to $1.24 after its launch, over 43.4% in an hour. The token’s price has decreased by over 52%, trading at $0.59 at writing time.</p>

<title>Standard Chartered Predicts Bitcoin At $150,000, ETH At $8,000 By Year-End</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />Standard Chartered银行的最新研究对比特币（BTC）和以太坊（ETH）提供了非常看涨的展望，预计到2024年底甚至更长时间，比特币可能达到15万美元，而以太坊可能达到8000美元。银行的研究深入探讨了推动比特币可能飙升至15万美元的因素，包括比特币现货交易所交易基金（ETF）的推出和以太坊最近的Dencun升级。银行认为，这些三项关键分析为Standard Chartered对比特币估值奠定了基石。银行还预测了以太坊到2024年底可能达到8000美元的路径，这取决于Dencun升级和预计的ETH现货ETF批准。展望到2025年及以后，银行认为ETH对比BTC的价格比率将回到7%水平，预计以太坊价格将在2025年底达到14000美元。<br /> <div>
<p>Standard Chartered&#8217;s latest research <a href="https://twitter.com/FinBizJedi/status/1769667188439560483" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">notes</a> offer a very bullish outlook for the major digital assets, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), by the end of 2024 and beyond. The bank&#8217;s analysts project Bitcoin could reach $150,000, while Ethereum could hit the $8,000 mark.</p>
<p>These projections come amidst a backdrop of significant developments in the crypto space, including the launch of Bitcoin spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and Ethereum&#8217;s recent Dencun upgrade.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin&#8217;s Path To $150,000</h2>
<p>The bank&#8217;s research delves deep into the factors propelling Bitcoin&#8217;s potential surge to $150,000 by year-end. Central to this projection is the influence of Bitcoin spot ETFs, which, since their <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/breaking-news-ticker/breaking-sec-approves-all-11-spot-bitcoin-etfs-btc-price-holds-steady-at-46000/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">launch on January 11</a>, have seen rapid inflows exceeding increases in open interest.</p>

<p>According to the bank, this suggests a more robust and sustainable positioning for Bitcoin, distinct from previous speculative peaks. &#8220;Rapid inflows to the new Bitcoin (BTC) spot ETFs have dominated [&#8230;] Most of the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitwise-ceo-bitcoin-ipo-moment-what-it-means-for-price/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">inflows are likely to be sticky</a> pension-type flows,&#8221; Geoff Kendrick and Suki Cooper elucidate, highlighting the newfound stability in Bitcoin investment trends.</p>
<p>Three pivotal analyses form the cornerstone of Standard Chartered&#8217;s Bitcoin valuation:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Gold Analogy:</strong> Drawing parallels with the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/cathie-wood-bitcoin-gold/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">gold market&#8217;s response</a> to the introduction of US gold ETFs, the bank estimates Bitcoin could rise to the $200,000 level, marking a 4.3x increase from its pre-ETF price.</li>
<li><strong>Two-Asset Optimization:</strong> By optimizing a portfolio with 80% gold and 20% Bitcoin at current gold prices, the analysis suggests a Bitcoin level around $190,000.</li>
<li><strong>ETF Inflows Correlation:</strong> Linear extrapolation based on the correlation between ETF inflows and Bitcoin price points to a possible $250,000 level, assuming total ETF inflows around the bank&#8217;s midpoint estimate of $75 billion.</li>
</ol>
<p>Standard Chartered notes that these three measures suggest “that $200,000 is the &#8216;correct&#8217; end-2025 price level for BTC, [&#8230;] and that it is likely to be the new midpoint for a sideways trading range at that time.”</p>

<p>Further the research notes that an “overshoot to $250,000 is likely at some point in 2025 if ETF inflows continue apace and/or reserve managers buy BTC.” Previously, the bank only <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/mark-your-calendars-bitcoin-to-hit-100000-by-end-of-2024-standard-chartered-says/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">predicted</a> a Bitcoin price of $100,000 by the end of 2024.</p>
<h2>Ethereum&#8217;s Road To $8,000</h2>
<p>Ethereum&#8217;s expected climb to $8,000 by the end of 2024 is anchored in two transformative developments: the Dencun upgrade and the expected approval of ETH spot ETFs. The recent <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/dencun-upgrade-officially-deployed-on-ethereum-mainnet-eth-price-holds-steady-below-4000/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Dencun upgrade</a>, by significantly lowering transaction costs on layer 2 blockchains, enhances Ethereum&#8217;s competitive edge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ethereum (ETH) has just undergone the ‘Dencun’ upgrade, which dramatically lowers the cost of transactions [&#8230;] making ETH more competitive,&#8221; the research notes.</p>
<p>The forecast also hinges on the anticipation of US SEC approval for ETH ETFs by May 23, a decision poised to catalyze substantial inflows into Ethereum. Drawing from the Bitcoin ETF experience, Standard Chartered expects similar enthusiasm for Ethereum, with projected inflows of 2.39-9.15 million ETH (equivalent to roughly $15-45 billion).</p>
<p>This substantial capital infusion is seen as a crucial lever for Ethereum&#8217;s price surge. &#8220;We expect significant ETF-driven inflows to ETH [&#8230;] This could drive ETH to the $8,000 level by end-2024,&#8221; the bank elaborates, underscoring the parallel potential for growth akin to Bitcoin&#8217;s trajectory.</p>
The Prognosis For 2025 And Beyond
<p>Looking further ahead, Standard Chartered ventures into the terrain of 2025 predictions, where the bank sees the ETH-to-BTC price ratio ascending back to the 7% level, a hallmark of the 2021-22 period.</p>
<p>This adjustment forecasts an Ethereum price of $14,000 by the end of 2025, given the projected Bitcoin level of $200,000. Such a scenario underscores the bank&#8217;s optimism about the enduring value proposition and growth potential of these leading digital assets in the medium term.</p>
<p>At press time, BTC traded at $68,401.</p>

<title>Shiba Inu Open Interest Suffers 40% Crash, What Does This Mean For Price?</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-open-interest-40-crash/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-open-interest-40-crash/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。<br />Shiba Inu的开放利益经历了一次急剧下跌，下跌超过40％。这表明对该加密货币的兴趣正在减少，可能导致价格下跌。历史数据显示，开放利益的下降通常会与价格下跌相一致。然而，当前的牛市周期仍处于早期阶段，可能有更多需求来避免价格崩盘。 <div>
<p class="p2">The Shiba Inu open interest has hit a snag after a particularly good run. The open interest had <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/forget-dogecoin-shiba-inu-set-to-become-the-top-dog-expert-predicts-100-billion-market-cap/">risen quickly alongside the price</a> of the meme coin, which climbed close to its previous all-time high earlier in March. However, the cryptocurrency has been unable to maintain this uptrend, leading to a significant drop in the open interest.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Shiba Inu Open Interest Sees Over 40% Decline</h2>
<p class="p2">According to <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/BitcoinOpenInterest" rel="nofollow">data</a> from Coinglass, the Shiba Inu open interest had hit a new two-year high on March 6 when its price crossed over the $0.000032 threshold. Since then, however, it has been on a decline, seeing a near-constant decline each day since.</p>

<p class="p2">By Monday, March 18, the Shiba Inu open interest had dropped from its $135 million all-time high to just $80 million. This decline translates to an over 40% decrease in the space of two weeks. At the same time, the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/crypto-analyst-shiba-inu-target/">price of the meme coin</a> has followed the same trend and has dropped from its yearly highs above $0.00004 to $0.000028 at the time of writing.</p>
<p class="p2">Now, the open interest for any cryptocurrency is important because it serves as a measure of the total interest in that asset at any given time. It basically shows the total number of all futures and/or options contracts for a particular asset. So in this case, it shows the amount of money invested in <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-whales-shib/">SHIB</a> derivative products at any time.</p>
<p class="p2">Given this, an increase in the open interest can be bullish for a cryptocurrency such as Shiba Inu, while a decrease can be bearish. This is because, the lower the open interest, the less money is being put into that particular asset, thereby decreasing the demand. So this could negatively affect the price.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Will SHIB Price Continue To Decline?</h2>
<p class="p2">As seen historically, a decline in open interest has often coincided with a decline in price. As such, the present decline being experienced by Shiba Inu could spell bad news for its price going forward. The effect is already being felt with the price of SHIB dropping significantly over the weekend, although it has started to recover as the new week opens up.</p>

<p class="p2">To get an idea of where the price might be headed next, we can take a look at the last time that the Shiba Inu open interest was this high, back in 2021. The open interest had reached its current all-time high in October 2021, but after peaking, both the open interest and the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-whales-shib/">SHIB price</a> would suffer tremendously.</p>
<p class="p2">Over the course of the next few months, the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/forget-dogecoin-shiba-inu-set-to-become-the-top-dog-expert-predicts-100-billion-market-cap/">SHIB price</a> would fall more than 50%, following the same trend as the open interest. If this trend were to continue this time around, then the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-whales-shib/">SHIB price</a> may be headed for a price crash.</p>
<p class="p2">However, 2021 marked the end of the bull market, while the current bull cycle is only in the beginning stages. In this case, there is more demand, which would mean there is more of a cushion to mitigate a price crash.</p>

<title>Shiba Inu Price Soars 10% In Reaction To Explosive 2,367% SHIB Burn Surge</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-price-soars-10-in-reaction-to-explosive-2367-shib-burn-surge/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />Shiba Inu（SHIB）是一种以太坊网络上的加密货币，最近经历了大幅上涨，吸引了全球加密货币爱好者的兴趣。这次价格上涨的原因有多方面，包括市场情绪的增长、社交媒体的影响、名人和意见领袖的背书等。Shibburn的数据显示，Shiba Inu的销毁率在过去24小时激增，社区的销毁活动和加密货币的供需动态引发了对SHIB的看涨情绪。此外，SHIB的价格也出现了显著上涨，交易量增加，并且有望突破关键价格点，恢复并超越前期最高点。 <div>
<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB), a prominent Ethereum-based cryptocurrency, witnessed a substantial rally, bolstering the interest of crypto enthusiasts worldwide. The nearly 10% surge in price on Monday has been attributed to a wave of market optimism, coinciding with a significant burn surge revealed by Shibburn, the meme coin&#8217;s burn tracker.</p>
<p>The recent rally of meme coins can be attributed to various factors. Firstly, the growing market sentiment and excitement surrounding meme coins have attracted investors seeking high-risk, high-reward opportunities.</p>
<p>Additionally, the influence of social media platforms, viral marketing, and endorsements from celebrities and influencers have played a significant role in driving up the prices of meme coins.</p>

<h2><strong>Shiba Inu Burn Surge Analysis</strong></h2>
<p>According to Shibburn&#8217;s data, the burn rate for Shiba Inu skyrocketed by a <a href="https://www.shibburn.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">staggering 2,367%</a> over the past 24 hours, resulting in the destruction of a whopping 186 million coins.</p>
<p>This surge in burning activity has further heightened market optimism surrounding the meme token, as the Shiba crypto community continues to make remarkable efforts to enhance the SHIB tokenomics.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-598478" height="334" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Shibburn.png?resize=381%2C334" width="381" /></p>

<p>The continuous depletion of SHIB&#8217;s supply through burning activities has triggered discussions about the dynamics of supply and demand, igniting a hurricane of bullish sentiments for Shiba Inu. Notably, it is the community&#8217;s concerted efforts, including significant transfers to a dead wallet, that have primarily contributed to the rise in the burn rate.</p>
<p>Shibburn&#8217;s insights shed light on two massive transactions by the Shiba crypto community, both involving transfers to a dead wallet. The first transaction saw a transfer of 168 million coins, while the second involved the transfer of 16.68 million SHIB.</p>
<p>These actions reflect the community&#8217;s determination to bolster the tokenomics of <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Shiba Inu</a> and have further contributed to the burn surge witnessed recently.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/uVSbXZKK/" width="1835" /></p>

<h2><strong>SHIB Price Climbs Amid Optimism</strong></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">positive momentum</a> extends beyond burning activity, as Shiba Inu&#8217;s price experienced a substantial uptick of 10% over the past 24 hours, reaching a current trading value of $0.0000287.</p>
<p>This surge in price has been accompanied by a surge in trading volume by nearly 23% and a market cap increase of 10%, firmly establishing a<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/shiba-inu" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> bullish stance for SHIB.</a> However, it is important to note that the recent correction in Bitcoin&#8217;s price led to a temporary dip for Shiba Inu, which reached a low of $0.0000238.</p>

<p>With the recent upward movement, there is growing optimism that SHIB may breach the $0.00003 mark, potentially paving the way for a recovery trend that could push prices above the previous swing high of $0.000045 and even surpass the $0.00005 milestone.</p>
<p>Market observers are particularly encouraged by the burning chronicles of the meme coin, which further contribute to the prevailing market optimism.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Sentiment Cools Off, Price Rebound Soon?</title>

<div> 
<br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />最近比特币恐惧与贪婪指数显示情绪有所降温，为可能的反弹铺平了道路。指数考虑波动性、交易量、社交媒体情绪、市值主导和谷歌趋势。当前，投资者持有极度贪婪的心态，但指数现在为77，显示情绪有所减缓。先前最高点与极端贪婪情绪重合，而最低点通常发生在市场处于极度恐惧区域时。比特币价格周末暴跌至64,500美元，但在过去一天中已经有所恢复，目前回升至68,000美元。 <div>
<p>The Bitcoin Fear &amp; Greed Index shows that the sentiment around the asset has cooled off a bit recently, something that could pave the way for a rebound.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Fear &amp; Greed Index Has Gone Through Some Decline Recently</h2>
<p>The &#8220;<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/crypto-fear-greed-index-drops-to-one-month-low-heres-what-it-means/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Fear &amp; Greed Index</a>&#8221; is an indicator created by <a href="https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Alternative</a> that tells us about the average sentiment present among the investors in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency market</p>
<p>To determine the trader mentality, the index takes into consideration for these five factors: volatility, trading volume, social media sentiment, market cap dominance, and Google Trends.</p>

<p>The metric uses a numeric scale that runs from zero to hundred for representing this sentiment. A score of 46 or less implies the presence of fear among the investors, while that of 54 and above suggests greed in the market.</p>
<p>The territory between these two (47 to 53) naturally corresponds to the neutral mentality. Besides these three sentiments, there are also two extreme sentiments called &#8220;extreme greed&#8221; and &#8220;extreme fear.&#8221;</p>
<p>The extreme greed occurs at values above 75, while the extreme fear takes place below 25. Historically, these two sentiments have been quite relevant for BTC&#8217;s trajectory.</p>
<p>Tops have generally tended to form when the investors have held the former sentiment, while bottoms have been probable to happen when the market has been in the latter region.</p>
<p>At present, the traders are holding a mentality of extreme greed, as the latest data of the Bitcoin Fear &amp; Greed Index shows.</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Fear &amp; Greed Index" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-598440 aligncenter" height="329" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/meter_b48137.png?w=368&#038;resize=368%2C329" width="368" /></p>

<p>As is visible, the indicator&#8217;s value is 77 right now, meaning that while it&#8217;s indeed inside extreme greed, it&#8217;s only so just. This is a fresh change from how it has been recently, as the chart below displays.</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Extreme Greed" class="alignnone wp-image-598444 size-large aligncenter" height="406" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/chart_be381d.png?w=860&#038;resize=860%2C406" width="860" /></p>

<p>From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that the Bitcoin Fear &amp; Greed Index has mostly stayed deep inside the extreme greed region recently. On the 14th of this month, the indicator hit the 88 mark, and alongside this high, the BTC price registered its current all-time high of about $73,800.</p>
<p>Since this peak, though, the asset has <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-threatens-to-retreat-to-60000-as-bulls-seek-solid-ground/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">plunged</a>, and it appears that alongside it, so has the sentiment among the traders. As mentioned earlier, tops have been more likely to occur when the market has shared a mentality of extreme greed and this probability has generally only gone up the more extreme levels the metric has hit.</p>
<p>This could perhaps explain why the recent top occurred when it did. Another top this month, the one that took place on the 5th, also coincided with high values in the Fear &amp; Greed Index (a peak of 90 this time).</p>

<p>Shortly after this earlier peak and the plummet in the cryptocurrency that had followed, the asset found its bottom as the metric briefly exited the extreme greed region.</p>
<p>As the Bitcoin Fear &amp; Greed Index is once again looking to dip outside this territory, it&#8217;s possible that a bottom may be near for the price this time as well. It now remains to be seen if the sentiment would cool down enough in the coming days so as to leave the extreme region behind, at least temporarily.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>Bitcoin had plunged towards $64,500 during the weekend, but it seems the coin has made some recovery in the past day as it&#8217;s now back at $68,000.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Approaches Risky Territory As Halving Event Draws Near</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。文章讨论了比特币价格下跌的趋势，并预测在即将到来的分叉事件之前可能会进一步下降。专家指出在历史上，比特币在距离分叉事件前14-28天经常出现大幅回撤。此外，文章还介绍了比特币分叉的4个不同阶段，包括分叉前的上涨、最终分叉前的回撤、重新积累和抛物线上涨。文章强调了在暴涨之前通常会有一个多月的重新积累阶段。 <div>
<p>The <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-hits-support-65k/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">price of Bitcoin</a> has been on a downward trend since it reached a new all-time of $73,000, ushering in a wave of speculations regarding the crypto asset&#8217;s next direction in the short term.</p>
<p>In the past few days, Bitcoin&#8217;s recent dip has triggered a general crypto market retracement. With the Bitcoin Halving event fast approaching, many crypto analysts are anticipating a further decline in BTC&#8217;s price in the near future.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Poised For &#8220;Danger Zone&#8221; Ahead Of Halving Event</h2>
<p>Popular cryptocurrency trader and analyst Rekt Capital has <a href="https://x.com/rektcapital/status/1769465412322766993?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">shared</a> a gloomy prediction for Bitcoin with the crypto community on the social media platform X. His forecast examines BTC&#8217;s potential to drop even further prior to the halving event while noting the entrance to a risky area he dubbed the &#8220;Danger Zone.&#8221;</p>

<p>The analyst&#8217;s forecast came in light of BTC experiencing a notable decline in the past few days. According to the expert, two days from now, Bitcoin will formally venture into the danger Zone (orange). </p>
<p>This is the starting area of past retracements seen ahead of the BTC Halving, which is expected to take place in April. Prior to the halving, these retracements have constantly indicated intervals of substantial market corrections for the digital asset. </p>
<img alt="Bitcoin" class="size-medium wp-image-598467" height="325" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rekt-Capital-Bitcoin-Chart-1.jpg?w=460&#038;resize=460%2C325" width="460" />
<p>Rekt Capital further pointed out that the pre-halving retracements have historically been observed in BTC 14-28 days before the event. Bitcoin&#8217;s price witnessed a pullback of about 40% in advance of the 2016 halving occurrence. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, in 2020, the crypto asset fell by over 40% before the occasion. Presently, we are less than 30 days before this year&#8217;s <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/grayscale-next-bitcoin-halving-different/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">BTC halving</a> takes place; however, the price of the coin has declined by over 11% in the past week, suggesting further correction in the coming weeks. </p>
<p>The post read:</p>
<blockquote><p>In 2 days, Bitcoin will officially enter the &#8220;Danger Zone&#8221; (orange) where historical Pre-Halving Retraces have begun. Historically, Bitcoin has performed Pre-Halving Retraces 14-28 days before the Halving. In 2020, this retrace was -20% deep, and in 2016, this retrace was -40% deep. Currently, BTC is 30 days away from the Halving and has pulled back -11% this week.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is noteworthy that the crypto analyst had previously <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/historical-trends-unveil-bitcoin-peak-timing-in-current-bull-cycle/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">pinpointed</a> the timeframe BTC is expected to top out in this bull cycle. Rekt Capital believes the asset will peak within 280-350 days. Specifically, this could occur around mid-December this year, or in mid-February of next year.</p>
<h2>4 Distinct Halving Phases</h2>
<p>So far, the crypto analyst has <a href="https://x.com/rektcapital/status/1769656725341163692?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">highlighted</a> several different phases for the upcoming Bitcoin Halving; these include the Pre-Halving Rally, Final Pre-Halving Retrace, Re-accumulation, and Parabolic uptrend.</p>

<p>According to Rekt Capital, there usually is a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/whats-ahead-for-bitcoin-expert-forecasts-pre-halving-rally-as-early-as-next-week/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">pre-halving rally</a> approximately 60 days before the event takes place. For the final pre-halving retrace, it usually develops around 14 to 28 days ahead.</p>
<p>Furthermore, after the Pre-Halving pullback, a multi-month re-accumulation period follows. Lastly, the parabolic uptrend begins once Bitcoin exits the area of re-accumulation.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Threatens To Retreat To $60,000 As Bulls Seek Solid Ground</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。比特币价格在创纪录高点后出现剧烈价格回调，导致投资者担忧可能出现更多熊市迹象。分析人士指出，投资者情绪受到影响，地址活跃度下降，市场存在卖压。然而，一些技术分析显示60,000至67,000美元之间可能是买家的支撑区域。尽管眼下形势不明朗，一些分析师看好比特币的长期前景，认为当前回调是牛市的正常和健康部分。机构资本的可能回归也被认为是潜在的反弹催化剂。 <div>
<p>After a spectacular ascent to record highs, Bitcoin (BTC) is facing a reality check. The past week has seen a dramatic price correction, leaving investors wondering if this is a temporary setback or a sign of a more bearish future.</p>
<p>The world&#8217;s most popular cryptocurrency reached an<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> intraday low of $64,620</a> on March 17th, a significant drop from its recent peak above $73,000. This pullback has triggered a wave of pessimism, with analysts pointing to declining profitability and a drop in daily active addresses on the network.</p>

<h2><strong>A Bearish Shadow Looms</strong></h2>
<p>According to analysts, investor sentiment has been hurt by a series of descending peaks and failed upturns, while selling pressure remains rampant as we approach the &#8220;weekly candle close.&#8221; This sentiment is echoed by data from IntoTheBlock, which shows a sharp decline in the number of addresses &#8220;In the Money,&#8221; signifying a decrease in overall profitability within the Bitcoin network.</p>

<h2><strong>Finding Support: A Beacon of Hope?</strong></h2>
<p>However, not everyone is hitting the panic button. Technical analysis suggests a potential support zone for buyers between $60,000 and $67,000. Popular trader Skew highlights this area as a possible turning point, while also acknowledging significant spot selling from major exchanges like Coinbase and Binance.</p>

<strong>Bulls On The Horizon: Are The Giants Awakening?</strong>
<p>While the immediate future appears uncertain, some analysts remain bullish on Bitcoin&#8217;s long-term prospects. They view the current correction as a natural and healthy part of any bull run, pointing to historical data where similar pullbacks paved the way for further growth.</p>

<p>Adding fuel to the fire of optimism is the potential return of institutional capital. The recent resumption of buying from US Bitcoin ETFs and the prospect of a significant influx of funds from hedge funds and investment advisors in the coming months are seen as potential catalysts for a rebound.</p>


<p>Thomas Fahrer, CEO of Apollo, a decentralized online cryptocurrency platform renowned for its comprehensive crypto reviews and analysis of ETF inflows, echoes sentiments regarding X.</p>
<p>Fahrer characterizes the current state as a &#8220;Bear Trap&#8221; and pinpoints the resumption of buying from US Bitcoin ETFs on March 18 as a potential catalyst for an upward surge in X&#8217;s value.</p>

<p>Emphasizing the significance of increased institutional acceptance, Fahrer anticipates a surge in liquidity within Bitcoin ETFs, suggesting that substantial capital inflows from institutional investors have yet to materialize.</p>
<strong>The Verdict: Brace For A Volatile Week</strong>
<p>This week will be crucial for Bitcoin. The coming days will be a test of the cryptocurrency&#8217;s resilience and its ability to overcome the current selling pressure. If bulls can regain control and positive sentiment prevails, a return to record highs remains a possibility. However, if the downtrend continues, Bitcoin could face a more extended period of correction.</p>

<title>Solana Market Cap Set To Skyrocket 1,000%, Says Crypto Fund CEO</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-market-cap-1000-crypto-fund-ceo/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-market-cap-1000-crypto-fund-ceo/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章指出了Asymmetric的CEO兼CIO Joe McCann对Solana市值达到1万亿美元的乐观预测。McCann认为Solana胜过以太坊，因为以太坊的L1交易慢且昂贵，L2解决方案复杂，不适合零售用户。他认为Solana成功吸引了零售用户，尤其是通过与memecoin和投机交易的联合。Solana上的memecoin数量和交易量大幅增加，成为其吸引力和实用性的证明。McCann还比较了以太坊和Solana的市值，并认为Solana有潜力实现近10倍增长。Solana目前的交易价格为201.27美元。 <div>
<p>Joe McCann, the CEO and CIO of the crypto hedge fund Asymmetric, recently made a bold <a href="https://twitter.com/joemccann/status/1769497076667404528" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">statement</a> on X (formerly Twitter), forecasting a $1 trillion market cap for Solana. McCann&#8217;s argument hinges on several key points that detail why he believes Solana has achieved product-market fit (PMF) as &#8220;The Chain for Retail,&#8221; juxtaposing it against Ethereum&#8217;s challenges and perceived shortcomings for retail users.</p>
<h2>Solana Beats Ethereum</h2>
<p>McCann critiques Ethereum for not being designed with retail in mind, pointing out its slow and expensive Layer 1 (L1) transactions, alongside the user experience (UX) nightmare posed by its numerous Layer 2 (L2) solutions. He states, &#8220;Ethereum is not a chain designed for retail &#8211; the L1 is too slow and expensive and the L2s are (currently) a UX nightmare.&#8221;</p>
<p>The friction for new users, fragmented liquidity across over “40 L2s”, and the complications with bridging are highlighted as significant barriers to Ethereum&#8217;s adoption by a broader retail audience.</p>

<p>Turning his attention to corporate-backed open-source projects like Coinbase&#8217;s L2 solution, Base, McCann acknowledges their potential to solve some <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-fees-plunge-70-following-a-yearly-high-in-may/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">UX issues</a>. However, he also notes the inherent priority of such projects to serve corporate interests, often at the expense of broader community needs.</p>
<p>Despite his critique, he admits, &#8220;Most corporate open source ultimately ends up serving corporate priorities&#8230;and it should!&#8221; This acknowledgment underscores the complexity of balancing corporate involvement in blockchain development with the ecosystem&#8217;s decentralized ethos.</p>
<p>McCann attributes Solana&#8217;s rise to its ability to serve the retail segment effectively, particularly through its association with memecoins and speculative trading. Describing Solana as originally being &#8220;Blockchain at Nasdaq speed&#8221; for its high throughput and low latency, he notes a pivotal shift in its narrative towards retail.</p>

<p>He observes, &#8220;Not once has the concept of being The Chain for Retail<img alt="™" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" style="height: 1em;" /> ever surfaced. Until now.&#8221; This shift is largely credited to Solana&#8217;s embrace by the memecoin community and the speculative trading that follows, marking a clear PMF with retail users.</p>
<p>Highlighting the explosion of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/why-shiba-inu-pepe-dogecoin-are-far-from-done/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">memecoin speculation</a> on Solana, especially post-NFL season, McCann points out, &#8220;Since the NFL season ended, speculation on memecoins has exploded&#8230;<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/sponsored/bonk-price-prediction-next-big-altcoin-set-to-explode/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">BONK</a> and WIF are on Solana. [&#8230;] Thousands of them are being created everyday and trading volumes are exploding.”</p>
<img alt="Meme coins go parabolic" class="wp-image-598412 size-full" height="766" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GI6BLhYaIAApe5v.jpg?resize=1314%2C766" width="1314" />
<p>The extensive creation and trading volumes of these coins on Solana are seen as a testament to its appeal and utility for retail speculators. Notably, the majority of memecoins is on Solana, not Ethereum.</p>
<p>”Trading Bots aka the ‘<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bonk-price-jumps-over-30-as-robinhood-revolut-listing-speculations-gain-traction/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Robinhood</a>-ification of crypto’ has been driving the majority of the trading due to its&#8230;great UX. [&#8230;] And the majority of those bots are trading memecoins on Solana. Solana is now consistently flipping Ethereum in DEX volumes yet for some reason, SOL is still 1/4th the value of Ethereum, it was 1/8th just a few days ago,” McCann noted.</p>
<img alt="Trading bots " class="wp-image-598411 size-full" height="830" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GI6B9VAbAAAJc57.jpg?resize=1488%2C830" width="1488" />
<p>He contrasts Solana&#8217;s market cap with Ethereum&#8217;s, using their relative valuations to argue for Solana&#8217;s growth potential. With Ethereum valued at just under $500 billion and Solana at about $115 billion, he suggests that Solana&#8217;s path to a $1 trillion market cap represents a nearly 10x growth opportunity, far outpacing the potential for Ethereum.</p>
<p>&#8220;ETH to $1T is a double. SOL to $1T is nearly a 10x. Which horse are you gonna bet on? The fastest one, obviously,&#8221; McCann concludes, encapsulating his bullish outlook for Solana based on its retail-friendly ecosystem and the vibrant activity around memecoins.</p>
<p>At press time, Solana traded at $201.27.</p>
<img alt="Solana price " class="wp-image-598413 size-full" height="1673" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SOLUSD_2024-03-18_08-13-58.png?resize=3628%2C1673" width="3628" />

<title>SOL Price Crosses $200 Milestone, What’s Next For Solana?</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/sol-price-crosses-200/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/sol-price-crosses-200/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。Solana价格超过了$200关键阻力位，并显示出继续上涨的迹象。随着价格上涨，下一个重要的阻力位将是$205和$212。如果成功突破$212，可能会进一步上涨至$220水平。支撑位在$195和$175附近，以及在$165和$150水平。技术指标显示MACD朝着多头方向走高，RSI也位于50水平以上。 <div>
<p><em>Solana is gaining bullish momentum above $200. SOL price is still showing positive signs, and it could even surpass the $220 resistance in the near term.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>SOL price gained bullish momentum and cleared the $200 resistance against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>The price is now trading above $200 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $195 on the 4-hour chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken).</li>
<li>The pair could continue to rally if it clears the $205 and $212 resistance levels.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Solana Price Extends Rally</h2>
<p>Solana price remained strong above the $150 level and extended its <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/sol-price-breaks-150/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">rally</a>. There was a decent increase above the $165 and $180 levels.</p>
<p>The price is up nearly 20% and there was a move above the $200 level, outperforming Bitcoin and <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-grinds-lower-3400/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ethereum</a>. A new multi-month high was formed near $204, and the price is now consolidating gains. It is stable above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $142 swing low to the $204 high.</p>
<p>There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $195 on the 4-hour chart of the SOL/USD pair. Solana is now trading above $200 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Solana_f3319d.png?resize=1024%2C461"><img alt="SOL Price" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-598388" height="461" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Solana_f3319d.png?resize=1024%2C461" width="1024" /></a></p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/SOLUSD/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SOLUSD on TradingView.com</a></p>
<p>Immediate resistance is near the $205 level. The next major resistance is near the $212 level. A successful close above the $212 resistance could set the pace for another major increase. The next key resistance is near $220. Any more gains might send the price toward the $232 level.</p>
<h2>Are Dips Supported in SOL?</h2>
<p>If SOL fails to rally above the $205 resistance, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $195 level and the trend line.</p>
<p>The first major support is near the $175 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $142 swing low to the $204 high, below which the price could test $165. If there is a close below the $165 support, the price could decline toward the $150 support or the 100 simple moving average (4 hours) in the near term.</p>
<p>Technical Indicators</p>
<p>4-Hours MACD – The MACD for SOL/USD is gaining pace in the bullish zone.</p>
<p>4-Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for SOL/USD is above the 50 level.</p>

<title>Introducing Book Of Meme (BOME), The Latest $1 Billion Crypto Sensation</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/meme-coin/introducing-book-of-meme-bome-the-latest-1-billion-crypto-sensation/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的<br />MEMECOIN项目Book of Meme（BOME）在加密市场上迅速崭露头角，吸引了投资者的兴趣，并在48小时内达到了10亿美元的市值。Book of Meme由DarkFarms创立，旨在结合Meme、去中心化存储解决方案、degen shitcoin交易和赌博，为用户创造新颖的web3体验。BOME在Binance上市后价格急剧上涨243%，市值达到15.5亿美元。投资者从BOME的涨势中受益，有人在预售时以19,000美元的投资获得340倍收益。当前，BOME的价格为0.02139美元，市值为11.8亿美元，居于第85位的加密货币。 <div>
<p>Memecoin project Book of Meme (BOME) has emerged as the latest shining star in the crypto market over the last few days. Following its official launch this week, BOME has attracted much investor interest, acquiring a market cap of $1 billion within 48 hours of trading.</p>
<p>BOME’s sudden emergence can be regarded as a silver lining in the crypto space in the last week amidst Bitcoin’s 4% decline, which resulted in the maiden cryptocurrency falling to around $65,345.14. Meanwhile, Ethereum is also down by 10%, while prominent memecoins <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-influencer-scams/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Dogecoin</a> and <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/behind-the-scenes-of-shiba-inu-12-plunge-what-on-chain-analysis-tells-us/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Shiba Inu</a> also recorded losses to the tune of 24.23% and 16.69% over the last seven days. </p>

<h2>What Is The Book Of Meme?</h2>
<p>The Book of Meme was founded by DarkFarms, the creator of another popular memecoin Pepecoin. BOME functions as an experimental project aimed at incorporating memes, decentralized storage solutions, degen shitcoin trading, and gambling on a single platform in a bid to create a novel web3 experience. </p>
<p>Following a successful presale that raised 10,131 SOL, BOME debuted in the crypto market on March 14 with an initial price of $0.0000496. Over the next two days, Book of Meme swiftly rose to a price region of $0.012 while achieving a market cap value of $1 billion. </p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Due to the sudden listing by Binance, MEMECOIN BOME rose sharply by 243% in 24h, but other MEMECOINs generally fell sharply, PEPE WIF FLOKI BONK fell by more than 10%. The current market value of BOME has exceeded US$1.38 billion, ranking seventh in MEMECOIN in terms of market…</p>
<p>— Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1769015001304781183?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">March 16, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/forget-dogecoin-shiba-inu-set-to-become-the-top-dog-expert-predicts-100-billion-market-cap/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。Shiba Inu目标是达到1000亿美元市值，吸引了加密社区的注意。数据显示持有SHIB代币的地址数量激增，表明零售投资者对Shiba Inu的兴趣和采纳度在增加。大型交易数量也增加，显示机构投资者和鲸鱼积极参与。拥有50%总供应量的前100个地址表明拥有大金额SHIB的持有人对市场有潜在影响。尽管交易活动波动性较大，但Jake Gagain预测Shiba Inu有望超过Dogecoin，并达到1000亿美元市值。 <div>
<p>Shiba Inu, the meme coin sensation, is making headlines once again. With its sights set on a major achievement &#8211; a staggering $100 billion market cap &#8211; Shiba Inu has captured the attention of the crypto community.</p>
<p>This audacious ambition has been fueled by data from IntoTheBlock, shedding light on the coin&#8217;s potential. Additionally, renowned investor Jake Gagain has made a bold prediction, further igniting excitement within the crypto community.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SHIB&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">$SHIB</a> Will Be The First 100 Billion MC Memecoin. <a href="https://t.co/YogeSb2E7q" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/YogeSb2E7q</a></p>
<p>— JAKE (@JakeGagain) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeGagain/status/1768722585221566612?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">March 15, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<h2><strong>Shiba Inu: Growing Interest, Volatile Trading</strong></h2>
<p>According to analysis from IntoTheBlock, SHIB has witnessed a surge in the number of addresses holding the token. This surge indicates a growing interest and adoption of Shiba Inu among retail investors, who are eager to partake in the meme coin revolution.</p>
<p>Moreover, there has been a notable increase in the number of large transactions involving Shiba Inu tokens, suggesting institutional investors and whales are actively engaging with the coin.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-598265" height="216" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_b80e2e.png?resize=388%2C216" width="388" /></p>

<p><a href="https://app.intotheblock.com/register" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">IntoTheBlock&#8217;s data</a> reveals a concentration of wealth among the top holders of Shiba Inu. Approximately 50% of the total supply is held by the top 100 addresses, indicating the potential influence these large holders may have on the market dynamics and price movements of Shiba Inu. This concentration of wealth can play a significant role in shaping the future trajectory of the coin.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/0YSrdCdD/" width="1835" /></p>

<p>Trading activity surrounding the memecoin has also been a focal point of the analysis. The data highlights the volatility of Shiba Inu&#8217;s trading volume, with periods of intense fluctuations followed by relative stability. This volatility can be attributed to various factors, including market sentiment, news events, and overall market conditions.</p>
<h2><strong>SHIB $100 Billion Milestone</strong></h2>
<p>In the midst of this excitement, renowned investor Jake Gagain has made a bold prediction: He firmly believes that Shiba Inu has the potential to surpass Dogecoin and reach a remarkable $100 billion market cap. This prediction has sparked both enthusiasm and skepticism, as the rivalry between Shiba Inu and Dogecoin intensifies.</p>

<p>Taking all these factors into account, the journey towards the billion-dollar market cap for <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/shiba-inu-mania-price-surges-60-as-burn-rate-heats-up-by-over-22000/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Shiba Inu</a> is not without its challenges. While the recent surge in market cap and the accumulation by large holders are positive indicators, the volatility and concentration of wealth present potential risks that need to be navigated.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the resilience and determination exhibited by the memecoin, coupled with the growing interest from retail and institutional investors, provide a strong foundation for its pursuit of the $100 billion milestone.</p>
<p>Shiba Inu&#8217;s quest for a $100 billion market cap represents a paradigm shift in the world of meme coins. Backed by data from IntoTheBlock, which highlights growing adoption, concentration of wealth, and trading activity, as well as the bold prediction from Jake Gagain, SHIB has positioned itself as a formidable contender in the cryptoverse.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。<br />马提克（MATIC）价格出现显著下跌，过去一周下跌超过10%，不到24小时下跌8%。数据显示大约10,900个地址在价位区间$1.02至$1.05购买了6.08亿MATIC，为该区间建立了关键支撑。如果这支撑破裂，下一个重要需求区域位于约$0.91。马提克当前价格为$1.04，市值超过97亿美元，排名第18。 <div>
<p><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/polygon/polygon-matic-whale-deposit-binance-bearish/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">MATIC, the native token of the Polygon network</a>, has witnessed a significant decline in its value. It has fallen by more than 10% in the past week and 8% in less than 24 hours as the general cryptocurrency market continues to grapple with a cloud of negative sentiment.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the latest on-chain analysis has revealed the important levels that investors should look out for following the latest decline in the MATIC price.</p>
<h2>Over 10,900 Addresses Bought 600 Million Polygon Tokens At This Price</h2>
<p>According to a recent <a href="https://x.com/ali_charts/status/1769135468208119809?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post on X</a> by crypto pundit Ali Martinez, the price of MATIC has established a key support around its current price point. This evaluation is based on analytics firm IntoTheBlock’s on-chain data, which tracks the average acquisition price for any given wallet address.</p>
<p><img alt="MATIC" class="aligncenter wp-image-598220 size-large" height="292" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GI06oELX0AA8aSo-1.jpeg?w=860&#038;resize=860%2C292" width="860" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Above is the chart highlighted by <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-long-positions-surge-on-bitfinex-whales-add-4230-btc-signaling-potential-price-reversal/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Martinez</a> that shows the distribution of the Polygon token supply across various price ranges. The size of the dots in the chart represents the magnitude of coins purchased around the corresponding price range.</p>

<p>Most notably, over 10,900 wallet addresses bought a whopping 608 million MATIC around the $1.02 and $1.05 zone. According to the crypto analyst, this massive buying activity has supported the establishment of crucial support around this price region.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Polygon?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">#Polygon</a> has found crucial support between $1.02 and $1.05, supported by 10,900 addresses holding around 608 million <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MATIC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">#MATIC</a>. Should this support falter, the next essential demand zone lies near $0.91, where 35,700 addresses collectively hold 394.6 million <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MATIC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">$MATIC</a>. <a href="https://t.co/rLn4ymcQf7" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/rLn4ymcQf7</a></p>
<p>— Ali (@ali_charts) <a href="https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1769135468208119809?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">March 16, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>While the large size of the dot reflects the strength of this particular level, sustained bearish pressure could cause the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/altcoins-watchlist-market-expert-spotlights-eth-blur-matic-and-more-for-explosive-gains/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">price of MATIC to breach</a> and fall beneath this support. In this case, investors could see the cryptocurrency drop to around $0.91.</p>
<p>This makes the $0.89 and $0.92 price range another level to watch, as it represents the next vital support area, where 35,680 wallet addresses purchased nearly 400 million Polygon tokens.</p>
<h2>MATIC Price Overview</h2>
<p>As of this writing, the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/matic/polygon-vesting-matic-price-3/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">price of MATIC</a> stands at $1.04, reflecting an 8% decline in the past 24 hours. This price dip comes after the altcoin printed a multi-month high of $1.28 on Thursday, March 14.</p>
<p>According to data from CoinGecko, the Polygon coin has suffered a 9.7% price slump in the last seven days. From a broader perspective, though, the cryptocurrency has had a fairly positive performance in the past month.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">With a market capitalization of more than $9.7 billion, the MATIC token ranks as the 18th-largest cryptocurrency in the sector.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Crashes: Dip To $65,000 Triggers Over $400 Million Liquidation Avalanche</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。比特币价格急剧下跌，导致市场动荡。在过去一周内，比特币价格下跌至65,000美元，其他加密货币也受到影响。市场分析师警告进一步下行风险，市场情绪不佳。总市场清算额超过4.26亿美元，长线交易者损失最严重。市场投资者开始重新评估策略。 <div>
<p>In a tumultuous turn of events, the cryptocurrency market has been rattled by a sharp decline in Bitcoin prices. After a sustained period of remarkable gains and record highs, Bitcoin has plunged to a weekly low of $65,000, marking a significant setback for investors.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bitcoin numbers were all painted in red,</a> and trading at $65,710, losing value in the 24-hour and weekly timeframes by 5.6% and 4.5%, respectively, according to data from Coingecko.</p>
<p>A few days after its previous low of $68,000, Bitcoin plummeted to its present level, a figure not seen in a week, as bears persisted in their downward pressure.</p>



<h2><strong>Altcoins Also Take A Beating</strong></h2>
<p>While Bitcoin bears the brunt of the downturn, altcoins are not spared from the fallout. Ethereum (ETH) and Binance Coin (BNB) have also witnessed<a href="https://coinank.com/liqMapChart" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> substantial losses</a>, shedding 10% of their value or more.</p>
<p>Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, two popular meme coins, have experienced even steeper declines, plunging by 20% and nearly 30%, respectively. The broader altcoin market mirrors Bitcoin&#8217;s downward trajectory, amplifying the sense of unease among investors.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/ISYm1HEA/" width="2475" /></p>

<strong>Bitcoin: Impact On Market Dynamics</strong>
<p>The recent price correction in Bitcoin has reverberated across the cryptocurrency landscape, reshaping market dynamics and investor sentiment. <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">The surge in liquidations</a>, with over 151,000 traders facing margin calls in the past 24 hours, underscores the magnitude of the market upheaval. Bitcoin&#8217;s dominance in the market is evident as it accounts for the lion&#8217;s share of the total liquidations, highlighting its pivotal role in shaping overall market trends.</p>
<p>As a result of the decline in value, the total market liquidations have reached $426 million, with Bitcoin taking the worst hit.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-598210" height="384" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_562718.png?resize=724%2C384" width="724" /></p>
<strong>Liquidation Spree</strong>
<p>The amount that the price of Bitcoin has liquidated over the last 24 hours has exceeded $104 million, with long traders losing the most money—they lost $86 million compared to $18 million for short sellers. Ethereum saw a $48 million overall liquidation, with $33 million going to long traders and $15 million going to short traders, as a result of the losing run.</p>
<strong>Analyst Sounds Alarm Siren</strong>
<p>Meanwhile, market analysts such as Markus Thielen, CEO of 10x Research, have sounded the alarm bells, warning of further downside risks for Bitcoin. Thielen&#8217;s prediction of a potential drop to $63,000 sends a sobering message to investors, urging caution and prudence in navigating the current market environment.</p>
<p>His insights shed light on underlying concerns about Bitcoin&#8217;s market structure, including low trading volumes and liquidity, which exacerbate the risk of sharp price corrections.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-598209" height="340" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_34d7be.png?resize=588%2C340" width="588" /></p>
<p>Amidst the market turbulence, investors are grappling with the implications of Thielen&#8217;s analysis and adjusting their strategies accordingly. The era of meme coin mania appears to be waning, prompting investors to reassess their positions and secure profits while they still can.</p>

<title>Grayscale Submits Revised Application For Ethereum Spot ETF – What’s New?</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/ethereum-news/grayscale-submits-revised-application-for-ethereum-spot-etf-whats-new/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/ethereum-news/grayscale-submits-revised-application-for-ethereum-spot-etf-whats-new/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。文章提到，Grayscale已向美国证券交易委员会更新了以太坊现货ETF的申请，但随着最近的提醒，SEC批准以太坊现货ETF的成功几率降至35%。两位民主党参议员强烈敦促SEC主席不要批准加密投资产品，并限制未来加密ETF申请。他们指出，这些产品可能给零售投资者带来巨大风险。当前以太坊代币价格为$3,731，过去一天上涨了1.2%。 <div>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-spot-etf-grayscale-outflows/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Asset management firm Grayscale</a> Investments has updated its application for an Ethereum spot ETF (exchange-traded fund) with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<h2 class="p1"><strong>Ethereum Spot ETF Case Just As Solid As Bitcoin’s, Grayscale Argues</strong></h2>
<p class="p1">According to a recent post on X by Craig Salm, Grayscale’s chief legal officer, the asset management firm has <a href="https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/nyse/markets/nyse-arca/rule-filings/filings/2024/SR-NYSEArca-2023-70_Am._1.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">revised its 19b-4 form</a> for an Ether spot ETF. Salm claimed that this move was “important” in an effort for Grayscale to list and trade shares of its Ether Trust on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Arca.</p>
<p class="p1">The chief legal officer <a href="https://x.com/CraigSalm/status/1768750794021511218?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">stated in his post</a> that investors “want and deserve access” to Ethereum via a spot exchange-traded product, likening the situation to the Bitcoin ETF story. “We believe the case is just as strong as it was for spot Bitcoin ETFs,” Salm said.</p>

<p class="p1">The asset manager is amongst the numerous firms <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/approval-denial-ethereum-etf-sell-the-news-event/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">looking to issue the first Ethereum spot ETF</a> in the United States, having filed an application with the SEC on October 10, 2023. However, these ETF applications have faced delays multiple times, with the most recent coming against BlackRock’s filing on March 4, 2024.</p>
<p class="p1">As a result, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-etfs-approval-odds-drop-to-35/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the likelihood</a> of the SEC approving an Ethereum spot ETF has taken a nosedive in recent weeks. Once-optimistic Bloomberg ETF expert Balchunas even revealed in his latest analysis that the ETH funds now have only a 35% chance of approval.</p>












<h2><strong>SEC Chairman Faces Pressure Over Crypto Approval</strong></h2>













<p class="p1">Two US senators of the Democrat party, Sens. Laphonza Butler of California and Jack Reed of Rhode Island, have urged the SEC chairman to avoid approving crypto investment products. In a letter dated March 11, the lawmakers, who are also members of the Senate Banking Committee, asked the Commission to limit future crypto ETF applications.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The success of the BTC spot products clearly ruffling some feathers on the Hill. <a href="https://twitter.com/SenatorJackReed?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">@SenatorJackReed</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Senlaphonza?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">@Senlaphonza</a> write to the <a href="https://twitter.com/SECGov?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">@SECGov</a> urging:-no further ETPs for other tokens-make life difficult (i.e. examinations/reviews) for brokers and advisers that recommend BTC ETPs <a href="https://t.co/enxdumC02N" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/enxdumC02N</a></p>

<p></p>
<p class="p1">Following the approval of 11 Bitcoin spot ETFs in January, the attention of the crypto public has somewhat turned to whether the SEC will do the same for the Ethereum versions. However, this latest letter from the senate seems to further <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-etfs-approval-outlook-fades-ahead-may-23/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">hurt the chances of an ETH ETF approval</a>.</p>

<p class="p1">A part of the letter read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">Retail investors would face enormous risks from ETPs referencing thinly traded cryptocurrencies or cryptocurrencies whose prices are especially susceptible to pump-and-dump or other fraudulent schemes,&#8221; they said. &#8220;The Commission is under no obligation to approve such products, and given the risk, it should not do so.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">As of this writing, the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-takes-hit-3680/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">price of the Ethereum</a> token stands at $3,731, reflecting a 1.2% increase in the past day.</p>
