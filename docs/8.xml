<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。加密分析师Willy Woo预测比特币将迎来稀有的“双泵”周期，预计2024年中和2025年将出现两次重要价格涨幅。尽管BTC最近经历了10%的下跌，但解决下跌势头的关键需求区在61,000美元，可能会吸引机构投资者。同时，根据加密分析师Charles Edwards的观察，BTC在特许的牛市拉回幅度约为30%，因此下跌至59,000美元甚至51,000美元的水平也是可能的购买机会。 <div>
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s recent downturn has prompted renowned crypto analyst Willy Woo to offer a fresh <a href="https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1770048197584683412?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">perspective</a> on the cryptocurrency&#8217;s future trajectory. Woo&#8217;s analysis, based on the surge in Bitcoin&#8217;s Macro Index, suggests an optimistic outlook for the leading digital currency, potentially indicating a pivotal shift in market dynamics.</p>
<h2>Unveiling Bitcoin Double Pump Prediction</h2>
<p>Willy Woo, a figure well-respected in the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/planbs-bitcoin-forecast-a-journey-to-5-million/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">cryptocurrency analysis</a> sphere, has recently shared insights that paint an intriguing future for Bitcoin.</p>

<p>According to Woo, the notable increase in the Bitcoin Macro Index could signal more than just a recovery; it might be the precursor to a rare &#8220;double pump&#8221; cycle.</p>
<img alt="Bitcoin Macro Index" height="649" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GJB5LsKbkAAajAz?format=jpg&amp;name=medium" width="1200" />
<p>Drawing parallels with the market patterns 2013, Woo&#8217;s forecast points towards two significant price surges for Bitcoin in the coming years. He anticipates the first peak by mid-2024 and a second, even more substantial top in 2025.</p>
<p>This dual surge scenario, though historically uncommon, aligns with Woo&#8217;s analysis of current market conditions and Bitcoin&#8217;s intrinsic <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/japans-1-5-trillion-pension-fund-assess-bitcoin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">growth potential</a>.</p>

<h2>Navigating Through The Bearish Terrain</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, the past week has not been kind to BTC, with the asset experiencing a roughly 10% decline. This downward trend extended over the past 24 hours, seeing Bitcoin&#8217;s value <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crashed-65000/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">dip</a> by 4.9%, bringing its <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-plunges-64000-on-chain-support/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">price to around $65,000</a>—a sharp fall from its recent peak above $73,000.</p>
<img alt="Bitcoin (BTC) price chart on TradingView" class="size-medium" height="1556" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/RvnsCvxk/" width="2770" />
<p>Amid this bearish price action, IntoTheBlock, a notable crypto analytics firm, suggests the $61,000 level as a critical demand zone, highlighted by the significant volume of Bitcoin purchased at this price point.</p>
<p>This area is deemed attractive for accumulation by institutional investors and large-scale traders, suggesting a possible recovery in the near future.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Bitcoin is looking for support. But where will it find it?
The $61k range could be a key area to keep an eye on. 805k addresses acquired over 466k BTC at this level, indicating a healthy appetite for <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">$BTC</a> around that level. <a href="https://t.co/XYw7LSC6Ji" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/XYw7LSC6Ji</a></p>

<p>Additionally, as Bitcoin navigates its<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/fomc-preview-bitcoin-crypto-fed-rate-move/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> current market challenges</a>, cryptocurrency analyst Charles Edwards points out that a typical pullback during a Bitcoin bull run amounts to about 30%.</p>

<p>With BTC having experienced its longest winning streak in history, a corrective dip to $59,000 or even $51,000, as per some predictions, remains within the realm of possibility.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">A normal Bitcoin bullrun pullback is 30%. Back in December, we were already in the longest winning streak in Bitcoin&#8217;s history. A 20% pullback here takes us to $59K. A 30% pullback would be $51K. These are all levels we should be comfortable expecting as possibilities.</p>
<p>— Charles Edwards (@caprioleio) <a href="https://twitter.com/caprioleio/status/1770049266532466783?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">March 19, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>These levels represent potential buying opportunities for investors looking to capitalize on Bitcoin&#8217;s cyclical nature and its anticipated ascension post-pullback.</p>

<title>Crypto Presale Frenzy Raises Over $122M Worth Of SOL In A Week</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。加密货币市场下跌，导致大多数加密货币出现红色数字。投资者转向预售狂潮，尝试从MEME代币中获利。截至3月12日以来，预售已筹集122.5万美元。27个基于Solana的MEME代币预售项目吸引了巨额资金，但许多项目在推出后迅速衰退。投资者面临损失，而欺诈者也利用这一趋势进行钓鱼诈骗。这种趋势可能导致MEME代币疲劳，对长期稳定性有害。 <div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The crypto market is down as most cryptocurrencies have registered red numbers for the past few days. Expectations of making big profits out of the bullish sentiment are momentarily halted. And while many patiently wait for the prices to rise again, others are seemingly looking for different options to make their bags.</p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto Presale Frenzy Sees Big Numbers</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The “<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solanas-biggest-memecoin-gains-681000-in-3-days-as-more-investors-bet-on-its-popularity/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">memecoin mania</a>” has been at the forefront of the market, stealing the spotlight since February. As a result, investors might see a window of opportunity to profit from these tokens.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">During the previous bull cycle, Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) were at the center of the stage, with millions of dollars invested in the tokens. This time, the biggest memecoins by market cap are being outshined by some of the newer players.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Dogwifhat and other <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-tokens-among-top-gainers-jup-and-wen-soar-over-12-wif-hits-new-ath/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Solana-based tokens</a> have led the way during this leg, registering massive gains in the last month. Recently, the presale and launch of Book of MEME (BOME), which started as a small experimental project, saw its surge to a $1 billion market cap in a few days.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The memecoin surge has now turned into a memecoin presale frenzy, with presale launching left and right after becoming the “meta” of the market.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="es">PRE SALE META <a href="https://t.co/z02vQWnnhz" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/z02vQWnnhz</a></p>
<p>&mdash; duss (@dussincook) <a href="https://twitter.com/dussincook/status/1769563711960658086?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">March 18, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The meta term, borrowed from the gaming community, refers to the Most Effective Tactic Available. As such, investors and scammers are equally attempting to take profit off the trend.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto investigator ZachXBT revealed on X that the current “presale meta” trend has raised $122.5 million since March 12. Taking the BOME project as a starting point, the crypto detective counted 27 different presales from Solana-based memecoins since that date. These projects raised approximately 655,000 SOL, according to the crypto sleuth calculations.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I was interested to see how much SOL has been sent as a result of the presale meta and calculated &gt;655,000 SOL ($122.5M) raised from 27 presales. <a href="https://t.co/dvsW4TSoov" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/dvsW4TSoov</a></p>
<p>&mdash; ZachXBT (@zachxbt) <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1769948459266707961?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">March 19, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">To put the numbers into perspective, ZachXBT highlighted that these figures only account for the projects on the Solana chain in the last seven days. This means that the calculations are only one part of the bigger image as the presales before March 12, and chains like Ethereum, Base, and BSC are excluded.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Memecoins Raising Millions In Minutes</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The biggest raiser on the list was the SMOLE token by visual artist Dekadente. This project received 169,982 SOL during the presale and has seen notable support from the community.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, the recently launched Slerf raised over 50,000 SOL. However, the token faced a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana-memecoin-presale-gone-wrong-creator-accidentally-burns-10m-whale-makes-huge-profit/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">dramatic launch</a> after its creator accidentally burned the tokens reserved for the presale participants airdrop.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Many of the presales <a href="https://twitter.com/ozempicsol/status/1769885246642954430" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">raised millions</a> in a matter of minutes, which hints at impressive participation from the crypto community. However, many <a href="https://x.com/Ape848/status/1769973480731082808?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">suggest</a> that the massive figures raised come from “fabricated fomo” and “insiders sending sol that they’ll eventually get back.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Despite raising millions in SOL, the presale meta trend left investors with nothing. As the investigator highlights, many of the presales on his list have seen a “hard rug” or the tokens’ momentum quickly fading after launch. As a result, the presale participants’ investments vanished or diminished considerably.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">depends if you mean hard rug or just presale contributors down bad</p>
<p>&mdash; ZachXBT (@zachxbt) <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1769952372581626051?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">March 19, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, scammers have taken their chance to profit off the presale frenzy. Phishing scams under the presale posts have skyrocketed, with impersonating accounts trying to drain investors’ wallets or collect whatever amount people meant to send to the presale addresses.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Members of the crypto community have expressed their concerns over the presale trend. Many crypto investors consider the trend might create memecoin fatigue, which <a href="https://twitter.com/barkery91/status/1769626690538320018" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">could hurt</a> the organic projects aiming for long-term stability.</p>

<title>Injective Launches Important Token Tool As INJ Bleeds</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/injective/injective-launches-important-token-tool-as-inj-bleeds/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/injective/injective-launches-important-token-tool-as-inj-bleeds/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。Injective Protocol推出了TokenStation，允许用户在其主网上创建原生代币，降低了代币创建的门槛。此外，与Volan合作升级了INJ代币经济学，使其逐渐紧缩。此外，与Rollup Technologies的合作有望提高Injective的安全性。尽管Injective在DeFi领域的声誉有所提升，并与Ethereum等平台进行合作，但其总锁定价值（TVL）相对较低，而INJ价格受到一定压力。 <div>
<p>Injective Protocol, a decentralized finance-centric platform, has launched TokenStation. In a <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.tokenstation.app/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> on March 18, Injective said the solution, deployed on its mainnet, allows users to launch native tokens. With this tool, Injective said it would empower anyone to create their tokens in a low-fee and scalable environment.</p>
<h2>Injective Launches TokenStation, Strikes Key Partnership</h2>
<p>The tool was developed by the Injective community and aims to &#8220;remove barrier to entry for token creation.&#8221; Like the token creation tools on Solana and Ethereum, for example, using TokenStation, part of the blog post won&#8217;t require coding experience. </p>
<p>Related Reading: <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crashed-65000/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Top Reasons Why The Bitcoin Price Crashed Below $63,000</a></p>
<p>This makes it easier for individuals and projects to launch on Injective. Beyond token minting, the tool allows token management and integration of tokenomics mechanisms like burning.</p>
<p>The blockchain is launching the TokenStation days after partnering with <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://blog.injective.com/en/injective-and-altlayer-bring-restaking-security-to-evm-applications/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">AltLayer</a>, a platform backed by Binance Labs dedicated to developing roll-up technology for Ethereum. Through this collaboration, the two will build a re-staking security framework for Injective Ethereum Virtual Machine (inEVM) applications.</p>
<p>The recently launched inEVM allows developers to seamlessly build applications leveraging the high scalability and near-zero fees on Injective. Additionally, the inEVM is set to increase composability between WebAssembly (WASM) and EVM environments. Through this unique feature, Injective can bridge the interoperability of Cosmos, the developer activity of Ethereum, and the high scalability of Solana. </p>
<h2>Will Volan Help Prop Up INJ Prices?</h2>
<p>In January, Injective Protocol <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://blog.injective.com/en/a-new-era-of-injective-the-volan-mainnet-upgrade/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">activated</a> the Volan Upgrade, setting the platform&#8217;s plans to build a robust real-world tokenization infrastructure into motion. Part of this was the introduction of a Real-World Asset (RWA) module. In this way, institutions can launch regulatory-compliant security tokens. </p>
<p>Additionally, Volan modified INJ tokenomics, making the token progressively deflationary. Burning reduces INJ tokens over time, a measure adopted by other protocols, including BNB and Ethereum.</p>

<p>While the upgrade and subsequent partnerships have lifted its prominence in decentralized finance (DeFi), growth has been slower than expected. </p>
<img alt="Injective TVL | Source: DeFiLlama" class="size-full wp-image-598677" height="354" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot592.png?resize=1024%2C354" width="1024" />
<p>So far, DeFiLlama data <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://defillama.com/chain/Injective" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">shows</a> that Injective Protocol commands a total value locked (TVL) of less than $65 million. This is miles behind Solana or Ethereum, two of the world&#8217;s most active smart contract platforms where active DeFi protocols also thrive.</p>
<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/x/T5jUkfpP/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="Injective prices trending downward on the daily chart | Source: INJUSDT on Binance, TradingView" class="size-full" height="904" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/T5jUkfpP/" width="1787" /></a>
<p>Meanwhile, INJ prices, although relatively higher, are under pressure, as seen in the candlestick arrangement in the daily chart. INJ is down 30% from 2024 highs, slipping and following <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crashed-65000/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin</a>. However, the coin is within a broader consolidation. Resistance and support levels are around $44 and $30, respectively.</p>

<title>Crypto Report Says ‘Alameda Gap’ Is Gone After Bitcoin Rally, What This Means</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/crypto-alameda-gap-bitcoin-rally/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/crypto-alameda-gap-bitcoin-rally/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />最近的研究报告指出了过去影响比特币和加密市场的“阿拉米达鸿沟”，但现在该鸿沟似乎已经消失。阿拉米达鸿沟源自Alameda的倒闭，导致市场缺乏流动性。然而，市场已经恢复了，比特币的市场深度几乎已完全恢复。比特币在价值上的表现胜过黄金，吸引了更多投资者。从长期来看，人们可能将黄金视为比特币的替代品。<br /> <div>
<p>In its most recent research newsletter, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-as-one-of-the-best-performing-assets-report/" rel="nofollow">crypto research firm Kaiko</a> alluded to an ‘Alameda Gap,’ which has been massively impacting the Bitcoin and crypto market for some time now. However, that seems to be in the past, as Kaiko stated that the gap no longer exists. </p>
<h2>What The Alameda Gap Is About</h2>
<p>According to the <a href="https://research.kaiko.com/insights/eth-lags-post-upgrade" rel="nofollow">report</a>, the ‘Alameda Gap’ is the gap in liquidity that existed after the collapse of the collapse of the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/major-reveals-from-the-ftx-bankruptcy-filing-whats-the-takeaway/">defunct crypto exchange FTX</a> and its sister company <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/blockfi-resolves-dispute-with-ftx-alameda-research/" rel="nofollow">Alameda Research</a>. Alameda was one of the most prominent market makers then and provided massive liquidity to the market. </p>

<p>Following Alameda’s collapse, this liquidity gap is said to have persisted as market makers “waited on the sidelines for sentiment and trading activity to recover.” Now, the market looks to have moved past this, as Kaiko revealed that, as of last week, the market depth has almost fully recovered and is back to its <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-collapse-sam-bankman-fried-trial/" rel="nofollow">pre-FTX average</a>. </p>
<p>The research firm added that the Bitcoin 2% market depth is up 40% year-to-date (YTD) and briefly surpassed its pre-FTX average of $470 million. This increase is said to have been mainly due to the surge in Bitcoin’s price, which has risen faster than the market liquidity since the SEC approved the Spot Bitcoin ETFs in January. </p>
<p>Bitcoin is up about 50% YTD and has already hit new highs since the beginning of the year, including a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-breaks-through-69000-setting-new-record/" rel="nofollow">new all-time high (ATH)</a> of $73,750. Meanwhile, the improvement in liquidity is also evident in the fact that the cost of trading has declined on the three major US crypto exchanges: Coinbase, Kraken, and Bitstamp. </p>
<h2>How Bitcoin Is Outperforming Gold</h2>
<p>Kaiko also highlighted in its report that the Bitcoin-to-Gold ratio, which measures both assets’ relative performance, is inching closer to its ATH, which it last hit in November 2021. Interestingly, this increase means that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/spot-bitcoin-etf-flows-flip-gold-capital-rotation/" rel="nofollow">BTC is outperforming Gold</a>, even though <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-and-gold-hit-record-breaking-milestones/" rel="nofollow">both assets have recorded ATHs</a> these past few weeks. </p>

<p>Furthermore, funds linked to these assets show how Bitcoin has outperformed Gold. Kaiko noted that Bitcoin ETFs have attracted $11 billion since they launched in early January. Meanwhile, the largest <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/spot-bitcoin-etf-flows-flip-gold-capital-rotation/" rel="nofollow">physically-backed Gold ETFs</a> (SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) and iShares Gold Trust (IAU) have <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/gold-out-bitcoin-in-etf-investors-flock-to-btc/" rel="nofollow">registered outflows</a> during the same period. </p>
<p>Kaiko suggested that this could mean that investors were moving towards Bitcoin as the “new global store of value.” Interestingly, the CEO of Jan3 and Bitcoiner, Samson Mow, while giving reasons why Bitcoin will hit $1 million, also <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-reach-1-million/#:~:text=Mow%20mentioned%20during%20an%20interview,demand%20far%20exceeds%20its%20supply.">mentioned</a> that people will start demonetizing Gold and substitute it for BTC at some point.  </p>

<title>AVAX Price Soars To Highest In Nearly 2 Years, Over 80% Of Holders In Profit</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/avalanche/avax-price-soars-to-highest-in-nearly-2-years-over-80-of-holders-in-profit/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。Avalanche (AVAX)在过去一周表现出色，在数字资产中成为表现最佳的加密货币之一，并达到了近两年来的最高价格。AVAX从市场信号中获得了提振，包括持有人的利润增加，大宗交易量增加，现货市场需求增加，以及期货合约的开放利息上升。市场观察家对AVAX的未来走势持谨慎乐观态度，未来有望建立在$70附近，但可能会遇到阻力。 <div>
<p>Avalanche (AVAX), the 10th-ranked cryptocurrency, has been on a tear in the past week, not only emerging as the top performer among major digital assets but also reaching its highest price point in nearly two years.</p>

<p>According to CoinMarketCap data, AVAX surged by an impressive 20%, surpassing its previous peak in May 2022 and reaching a<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/avalanche" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> price of $60</a> at the time of writing. This remarkable rally has ignited a wave of bullish sentiment within the crypto community.</p>
<h2><strong>AVAX Gets Boost From Strong Market Signals </strong></h2>
<p>Analysts are pointing to a confluence of on-chain activity and market signals that paint a bullish picture for AVAX. NewsBTC&#8217;s analysis revealed<a href="https://app.intotheblock.com/coin/AVAX" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> a key factor:</a> 84% of AVAX holders are currently sitting on profits, signifying a wave of positive sentiment within the investor community. This profitable position fosters a more optimistic environment, potentially attracting new buyers to the market.</p>

<p>Digging deeper into on-chain data, market observers at NewsBTC noticed a significant rise in large buy orders on the Avalanche network. This trend suggests that institutional investors or whales might be accumulating AVAX, potentially fueling the upward price movement.</p>
<p>The bullish momentum isn&#8217;t confined to on-chain activity. The spot market is also exhibiting strong demand for AVAX. <a href="https://coinalyze.net/avalanche/open-interest/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Coinalyze data</a> indicates a steady rise in the token&#8217;s Cumulative Volume Delta (CVD) since March 17th. CVD is a metric that gauges the difference between buying and selling volumes, and its current uptick suggests a clear dominance of buying pressure in the spot market.</p>

<h2><strong>Positive Vibes In The Air For AVAX</strong></h2>
<p>The derivatives market is echoing the optimism as well. Open Interest (OI) in AVAX futures contracts has been on an upward trajectory, reflecting a growing interest from investors looking to leverage the potential price increase.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that OI doesn&#8217;t necessarily indicate a long-biased market (where more traders are betting on a price rise), but rather highlights increased participation from both buyers and sellers.</p>
<p>However, the rising price alongside surging OI suggests that buyers are currently more aggressive, potentially leading to a breakout above resistance levels.</p>

<p>With this bullish tailwind propelling AVAX forward, analysts are cautiously optimistic about its future trajectory. Some market observers are of the opinion that AVAX has the potential to reach $70 soon.</p>
<p>However, they acknowledge the presence of a psychological hurdle at $70, where the price might encounter some resistance before continuing its climb. If the bulls can overcome this <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/avax-slips-adding-tension-to-365-million-avalanche-token-unlock-drama/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">obstacle</a> and achieve a decisive breakout, the bullish target of $75 might be within reach.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/BNhoEiw8/" width="1835" /></p>

<p>Looking at the potential downside risks, the article warns of a possible rejection at $70, which could trigger a price correction back down to $63. The report also emphasizes that the predicted upswing might not be a linear path, with potential price fluctuations along the way.</p>

<p>Avalanche (AVAX) is experiencing a period of strong momentum, buoyed by positive on-chain data, a surge in investor interest, and a bullish market sentiment. While some resistance levels and potential price corrections are to be expected, the overall outlook for AVAX appears promising in the near future.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Plunges Under $63,000, Here’s Where Next On-Chain Support Is</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-plunges-64000-on-chain-support/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-plunges-64000-on-chain-support/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。比特币价格下跌至63000美元以下，可能在61100美元、56685美元和51530美元的支撑水平处找到支持。另一方面，66990美元和72880美元的高成本基础水平可能会成为阻力。这些支撑和阻力水平基于链上数据，显示了投资者的购买活动，可能影响价格走势。BTC价格已下跌至62700美元，接近首个主要链上支撑水平。 <div>
<p>Bitcoin has deepened its decline in the past day with its price now slipping below $63,000. Here&#8217;s where the next potential support is, according to on-chain data.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Could Find Support At These Price Levels</h2>
<p>In a new <a href="https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1769979649600172220" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, analyst Ali has discussed how the Bitcoin support and resistance levels are looking like right now based on on-chain data from Glassnode.</p>
<p>The indicator of relevance here is the &#8220;<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/analyst-expect-decline-30220-bitcoin-loses-support/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">UTXO Realized Price Distribution</a>&#8221; (URPD), which, in short, tells us about the amount of coins (or more precisely, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-utxo-mid-long-term-holders-november-correction/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">UTXOs</a>) that were last purchased at any given price level that the asset has visited in its history so far.</p>

<p>Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the data for this distribution for the price levels around the recent spot value of the cryptocurrency:</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin URPD" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="1286" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GJA6duNWMAAECTA?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096" width="2404" /></p>

<p>From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that there are a few price levels not far from the current one that particularly stands out in terms of the amount of buying that took place at them.</p>
<p>In on-chain analysis, the potential for any level to act as support or resistance is based on the total number of coins that have their cost basis at the level in question.</p>
<p>Levels thick with coins that are situated under the current price would be probable to act as points of support, while those above the spot value could prove to be resistance walls.</p>
<p>As is apparent from the graph, the $61,100, $56,685, and $51,530 levels are the ones below the current price that hold the cost basis of a notable amount of the supply right now. Naturally, this means that should the decline continue further, these would be the levels to watch for a possible rebound.</p>
<p>Two levels above, however, are even larger than all three of these support levels: the cost basis centers around $66,990 and $72,880. Interestingly, the latter of these is the single largest acquisition level out of all the price levels listed in the chart, implying that a large amount of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-fomo-533330-addresses-bought-70180/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">FOMO buying</a> has occurred at the asset&#8217;s all-time high levels.</p>
<p>In the scenario that Bitcoin regains its upward momentum, these levels of high cost basis population would be where the asset could be most probable to find some trouble.</p>
<p>Now, as for why acquisition centers are considered relevant for support and resistance in on-chain analysis is the fact that investors are likely to show some kind of reaction when a retest of their cost basis takes place.</p>

<p>When such a retest is from above, the holders may decide to accumulate more, believing that the price will go up again in the future. On the other hand, they may sell instead if the retest is from below, as they may think exiting at break-even is better than risking another drop.</p>
<p>A large number of coins having their cost basis at the same level means a potentially large degree of one of these reactions happening and, hence, a strong support or resistance effect on the price.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>Bitcoin is inching closer to the first major on-chain support level as it has now dropped to $62,700.</p>

<title>Dogecoin Growth Hits Roadblock As Holder Activity Enters Dreaded Period Of Stagnancy</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-growth-holder-activity/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-growth-holder-activity/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。Dogecoin和其他主要热门炒作加密货币的地址数量增长速度已经减缓，尤其是在3月份。Dogecoin仅在本月新增了6万个地址，与2月份新增45万个地址的情况形成鲜明对比。其他热门炒作加密货币，如SHIB和PEPE，也没有看到持有者数量的增长。目前，DOGE的价格为约0.12美元，下跌近14%。这可能表明市场对炒作加密货币的关注正在减弱。 <div>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-5-3-million-holders-compares-top-coins/" rel="nofollow">The Dogecoin (DOGE) network</a> has entered a period of stagnancy, as the number of addresses holding the meme coin has slowed. This is a stark contrast to February and January, when the network experienced a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-doge-path-to-0-2/#:~:text=The%20Dogecoin%20adoption%20trend%20has,added%20in%20a%20single%20week.">significant expansion</a>. </p>
<h2>Dogecoin Has Added Only 60,000 New Addresses In March</h2>
<p><a href="https://app.santiment.net/charts/iXhlYy3R__sCl" rel="nofollow">Data</a> from the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/why-these-2-altcoins-could-witness-price-bumps/" rel="nofollow">market intelligence platform Santiment</a> shows that the total number of DOGE holders has increased by only 60,000 since the beginning of this month. At the start of the month, 6.51 million users were holding the meme coin, with this figure only increasing to 6.57 million since then.</p>

<p>This is unlike February when the total number of DOGE holders rose from 5.92 million to 6.51 million. Specifically, around this same time last month, the network had already seen an increase of 450,000 in the total number of addresses holding DOGE. Meanwhile, NewsBTC <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-doge-path-to-0-2/#:~:text=The%20Dogecoin%20adoption%20trend%20has,added%20in%20a%20single%20week.">reported</a> that over 400,000 new addresses were added in two weeks between January and February. </p>
<p>Dogecoin also set a new record in January alone when <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-doge-ready-to-pop/#:~:text=Dogecoin%20(DOGE)%20is%20getting%20ready,be%20added%20for%20it%20soon.">247,240 new DOGE addresses</a> were created on January 29. <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-analyst-predicts-1300-for-cardano/" rel="nofollow">Crypto analyst Ali Martinez</a> noted that a sustained uptrend in the network’s expansion “could soon reflect positively” on DOGE’s price. That underscores how significant the number of addresses holding the meme coin is. </p>
<p>The stagnancy in Dogecoin’s holder activity might also come as a surprise to some in the crypto community, considering the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/top-ai-meme-coins/" rel="nofollow">meme coin frenzy</a> that has taken the crypto space by storm. However, a plausible explanation is that meme coin traders aren’t necessarily invested in the prominent meme tokens but have their eyes on the undervalued gems. </p>
<h2>How Other Top Meme Coins Have Fared</h2>
<p>Data from Santiment also shows that the other two meme coins, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/big-moves-for-shiba-inu-pepe/" rel="nofollow">Shiba Inu (SHIB) and Pepe (PEPE)</a>, which make up the top three largest meme coins by market cap, haven’t fared better. <a href="https://app.santiment.net/charts/iXhlYy3R__sCl" rel="nofollow">Shiba Inu</a> hasn’t seen its holder count increase since the beginning of the month, with the total number of users holding the meme coin still at 1.38 million. </p>

<p>On the other hand, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/similarities-dogecoin-and-pepe/" rel="nofollow">PEPE</a> still has less than 200,000 holders despite boasting a year-to-date (YTD) gain of over 370%. These figures place <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-shiba-inu-pepe-metric/" rel="nofollow">DOGE firmly ahead</a> of SHIB and PEPE in terms of the number of users they all have. Dogecoin is expected to see its user base pick up once again as soon as there is a renewed interest in network functionalities like the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/the-dogecoin-surge-unveiling-the-catalyst-behind-rising-transactions/">Doginals</a>. </p>
<p>At the time of writing, DOGE is trading at around $0.12, down almost 14% in the last 24 hours, according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dogecoin/" rel="nofollow">data</a> from CoinMarketCap. </p>

<title>Bitcoin Suffers Massive Drop On BitMEX, Is The Rally Over?</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-suffers-massive-drop-on-bitmex-bulls-over/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-suffers-massive-drop-on-bitmex-bulls-over/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要: 这些信息是消极的。本文讨论了比特币在BitMEX交易所上的急剧下跌到8,900美元的事件，导致市场普遍下滑。一位用户卖出400个比特币导致价格急剧下跌，引发了一系列价格波动。比特币价格从68,000美元下跌至8,900美元，随后恢复正常。彼得·施菲夫预测比特币可能会出现更大的崩盘。当前比特币价格为62,943美元，24小时内下跌7%。 <div>
<p>Since Bitcoin (BTC) witnessed a crash this week to $64,000, the crypto asset has not been able to reclaim its momentum, with the price falling <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-at-risk-65k/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">even lower.</a> This has led to a general market decline that has affected altcoins.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Plummets To $8,900 On BitMEX Exchange</h2>
<p>In a devastating turn of events, Bitcoin witnessed a steep decline on the Seycelles-based cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX on Monday. <a href="https://x.com/WuBlockchain/status/1769926754121232554?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Reports</a> from blockchain media, Wu Blockchain, revealed that Bitcoin fell to around $8,900, following a massive BTC sell-off on the platform.</p>

<p>Wu Blockchain reported that a user sold over 400 BTC, which led to the price of Bitcoin falling to the aforementioned figure. Over the space of two hours, the unidentified user sold the 400 BTC in groups of 10–50 BTC.</p>
<p>Consequently, BitMEX&#8217;s market stability was impacted since the user sold the assets for incredibly low prices. However, according to reports from Blockchain Daily, the event was short-lived as prices have now returned to the normal level.</p>
<p>In response to the development, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitmex-co-founder-bitcoin-forecast-btc-to-reach-1-million-amid-banking-turmoil/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">BitMEX</a> has assured the crypto community that it is &#8220;looking into odd behavior&#8221; involving users selling substantial orders on the spot market for BTC-USDT.</p>
<p>The crypto platform further stated that while the investigation is ongoing, &#8220;the derivatives market will still be operational, including the index price for its popular XBT derivatives contracts.&#8221; Furthermore, the exchange confirmed the safety of users&#8217; funds and assets, and the platform is &#8220;running as usual.&#8221;</p>
<p>Given that the price of Bitcoin was situated at $68,000 before the incident, the drop indicates an over 87% decline. After falling to $8,900, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-whales-btc-exchanges/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin</a> recovered, but the abnormal price fluctuations lasted for an additional 30 minutes before things returned completely to normal.</p>
<p>The development has since stirred quite a frenzy within the cryptocurrency landscape, leaving the community to ponder on the reason behind the drop. Several crypto enthusiasts believe that the incident was a move orchestrated by BitMEX to manipulate prices to liquidate investors and end up making a lot of money.</p>
<h2>Larger Crash Might Take Place</h2>
<p>As Bitcoin continues to move downward, Gold advocate and crypto critic Peter Schiff has <a href="https://x.com/PeterSchiff/status/1769907447420817520?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">forecasted</a> a larger crash for prices. At first, Peter Schiff drew the crypto community&#8217;s attention to the 2021 rally, in which BTC peaked at $69,000.</p>

<p>However, the largest cryptocurrency witnessed a collapse the next year, and by November 2022, it was already trading at $16,000. As a result, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/peter-schiff-spot-bitcoin-etfs/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Schiff</a> mocked Bitcoin enthusiasts, asking, &#8220;How many of them still have their laser eyes on their profiles.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thus, considering that the majority are presently more optimistic about BTC, Schiff anticipates a &#8220;bigger crash&#8221; is probably on the horizon. </p>
<p>As of the time of writing, the price of Bitcoin was trading at $62,943, indicating an over 7% decline in the past 24 hours. Its market cap is down more than 7%, while its trading volume holds steady increasing by 63% in the past day.</p>

<title>FOMC Preview: Bitcoin and Crypto’s Fate Tied To Fed Rate Move</title>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章讨论了即将召开的联邦公开市场委员会（FOMC）会议对比特币和加密货币市场的影响。文章提到了比特币和以太坊在会议前期经历了严重的下跌，与美国经济指标和通胀数据有关。文章还提到了市场对FOMC利率和未来政策方向的预期，以及各种分析师对比特币和加密货币市场如何应对的看法。高盛预测了今年只会有3次降息。总之，市场正在谨慎地等待FOMC会议结果，并密切关注未来货币政策方向。 <div>
<p>In the lead-up to the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting scheduled for Wednesday, March 20, the Bitcoin and crypto market is experiencing a severe downtrend. BTC price has plunged roughly -10% in the past two days, and Ethereum (ETH) is down -12% in the same period.</p>
<p>The anticipation surrounding the Fed&#8217;s stance on interest rates has heightened in the wake of recent economic indicators, including unexpected <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/inflationary-concerns-rise-as-us-cpi-exceeds-predictions-bitcoin-price-reacts/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">spikes in the  US Consumer Price Index</a> (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI), stirring volatility across markets, including digital assets.</p>
<p>The consensus, with a 99% probability according to the CME FedWatch tool, suggests interest rates will hold steady. Nonetheless, the spotlight turns to the Fed&#8217;s dot plot, a graphical representation of the individual members&#8217; expectations for future interest rates, which could provide crucial insights into the monetary policy outlook for the coming months and years.</p>
<img alt="CME FedWatch Tool" class="wp-image-598663 size-full" height="1000" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/target-rate-probabilitie.png?resize=2000%2C1000" width="2000" />
<p>Anna Wong, Chief US Economist for Bloomberg, remarked via X (formerly Twitter), “Another reason why FOMC [is] not ready to cut: members not yet of broad agreement of that need. Here’s visualizing the dispersion of FOMC views with the help of our new weekly NLP Fed spectrometer. “</p>

<p></p>
<h2>How Will Bitcoin And Crypto React?</h2>
<p>Macro analyst Ted, expressing his perspective on X, underscores the nuanced relationship between macroeconomic trends and the crypto market at the moment. Ted elucidated that spot <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-etfs-see-record-1-billion-inflows/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin ETF flows</a> have taken the backseat while macro factors came to the foreground.</p>
<p>He <a href="https://twitter.com/tedtalksmacro/status/1769901194435338460" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">stated</a> via X, “If BTC is to be considered digital gold, it&#8217;s expected to mirror gold&#8217;s market movements, albeit with a higher degree of volatility. In the current climate, with the market bracing for the Fed&#8217;s upcoming meeting, macroeconomic factors momentarily take precedence, driven by recent developments in PPI and CPI figures.&#8221;</p>
<p>He further speculates that &#8220;Despite the eventual remarks from [Fed Chair] Powell, the market has already adopted a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/breaking-news-ticker/powell-speaks-at-jackson-hole-bitcoin-volatility-comes-back-with-a-vengeance/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">hawkish stance</a> in anticipation of a &#8216;higher for longer&#8217; interest rate scenario.&#8221;</p>

<p>Michaël van de Poppe, a noted figure in the crypto analysis domain, <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1769996367521353898" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">provided</a> his insights on the recent downward price movement of Bitcoin via X, citing a mix of factors including the anticipation of the FOMC meeting and significant capital outflows from <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/ethereum-news/grayscale-submits-revised-application-for-ethereum-spot-etf-whats-new/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Grayscale</a>&#8216;s Bitcoin Trust. Van de Poppe advises, &#8220;It&#8217;s typically in these pre-FOMC periods, perceived as risk-off intervals, that the savvy investor finds opportunities to &#8216;buy the dip&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>In a reflection of market sentiment adjustments, analyst @10delta on X<a href="https://twitter.com/_10delta_/status/1770036918991913188" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> pointed out</a> the strategic positioning of investors in anticipation of the Fed&#8217;s rate decisions. &#8220;The market is currently pricing in a reversal to the November &#8217;23 interest rate levels, a clear indication that investors are adjusting their expectations based on the Fed&#8217;s potential pivot signaled in the previous dot plot,&#8221; he noted.</p>
<p>Accordingly, he argues that the FOMC &amp; dot plot will be a &#8220;buy the news&#8221; event as the market expectations are being properly adjusted. &#8220;The macro worries [&#8230;] should dissipate &amp; crypto idiosyncratic bullish factors, such as the ETF inflows [&#8230;] as well as the BTC halving take hold. All considered I think there&#8217;s a good R/R for &#8216;buying the dip&#8217; heading into the March 20 event,&#8221; the analyst added.</p>
Goldman Sachs Predicts (Only) 3 Rate Cuts This Year
<p>Goldman Sachs Research recently provided a detailed analysis in their March FOMC Preview. The report highlights the nuanced balance the Fed seeks to achieve between controlling inflation and supporting economic growth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our revised forecast now anticipates three rate cuts in 2024, a slight adjustment from our previous prediction, primarily due to a modest uptick in the inflation trajectory,&#8221; Goldman Sachs analysts elucidated. They further speculate, &#8220;While the immediate focus is on maintaining current rate levels, the trajectory for rate cuts will hinge on inflation dynamics and economic performance indicators.&#8221;</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs further predicts that the Fed will still target a first cut in June. “This combined with a default pace of one cut per quarter implies that the most natural outcome for the median dot is to remain unchanged at 3 cuts or 4.625% for 2024,” the banking giant remarked.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Goldman: Inflation has been firmer in recent months, but we think it is still on track to fall enough by the June FOMC meeting for a first cut. <a href="https://t.co/0I1BPYiU8W" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/0I1BPYiU8W</a></p>

<p></p>
<p>As the crypto market and broader financial ecosystems await the outcomes of the FOMC meeting, the prevailing sentiment is one of cautious anticipation. Market participants are closely monitoring the Fed&#8217;s commentary for indications of future monetary policy directions via the dot plot.</p>
<p>The question for the Bitcoin and crypto market is whether there will be an unpleasant surprise or whether market participants were right with their &#8220;higher for longer&#8221; policy assumption.</p>
<p>At press time, BTC found support at the $62,400 price level, trading at $63,118.</p>

<title>Top Reasons Why The Bitcoin Price Crashed Below $63,000</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要: 这些信息是消极的。<br />比特币价格在过去24小时跌破了63,000美元，目前正处于价格修正阶段，最近创下73,750美元的历史新高。导致价格下跌的原因可能包括比特币减半即将到来。分析人士表示比特币正在进入减半趋势的第二阶段，长期持有者开始获利了，导致利润回吐。当前比特币情绪偏向熊市。 <div>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/why-bitcoin-halving-could-bring-uncertainty-to-mining-industry/" rel="nofollow">The flagship cryptocurrency, Bitcoin</a>, dropped below the $63,000 mark in the last 24 hours and is currently on a price correction, having recently hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $73,750. This price dip is believed to be due to several factors, including the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bull-market-glassnode/" rel="nofollow">Bitcoin Halving</a>, which is fast approaching. </p>
<h2>Bitcoin Price Is In The Second Phase Of The Halving Trend</h2>
<p>Crypto trader and analyst Rekt Capital <a href="https://x.com/rektcapital/status/1769656725341163692?s=20" rel="nofollow">recently provided</a> insights into the four phases of Bitcoin Halving, which provides a plausible explanation for Bitcoin’s recent decline. He suggested that Bitcoin was entering into the ‘Final Pre-Halving Retrace,’ having just concluded with the ‘<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/history-backs-buying-bitcoin-dip-before-halving/" rel="nofollow">Pre-Halving Rally</a>.’</p>

<p>This ‘Final Pre-Halving Retrace’ is said to occur 28 to 14 days before the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/grayscale-next-bitcoin-halving-different/">Halving event</a>. However, it looks to have come earlier this time around (just like the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-59000-pre-halving-rally/">Pre-Halving Rally</a>), with the Halving still about 30 days away. Rekt Capital alluded to the Pre-Halving retrace in 2016 and 2020 when Bitcoin pulled back by 38% and 20%, respectively. </p>
<p>Bitcoin has already pulled back over 11% in the past week. Interestingly, the analyst noted that this phase of the Halving can last “multiple weeks and up to 77 days.” Rekt Capital, however, expects it to be much shorter than <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/historical-bull-run-pattern-finally-forming-bitcoin/" rel="nofollow">historical ones</a>. He added that this year’s Pre-Halving Retrace “would more likely be on the shallower side than on the deeper side.”</p>
<h2>Long-Term Bitcoin Holders Are Taking Profit</h2>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/pro-xrp-lawyer-threat-crypto/" rel="nofollow">Alex Thorn</a>, Head of Research at Galaxy Digital, highlighted in an X (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/intangiblecoins/status/1769823573370150919?s=20" rel="nofollow">post</a> that long-term Bitcoin holders are starting to sell. This is evidenced by different metrics, such as the movement in coins that had stagnated for over a year. </p>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/analyst-predicts-when-dogecoin-will-reach-1/" rel="nofollow">Crypto analyst Ali Martinez</a> previously alluded to this wave of profit-taking, noting data from market intelligence platform Glassnode, which showed that those holding over 1,000 BTC were increasingly cashing out. This has also led to a 4.83% drop in this category of BTC addresses this past few weeks. </p>
<p>Thorn, however, sounded optimistic about Bitcoin’s future trajectory in his post, noting that new whales are entering (through the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-spot-etf-100-volume/" rel="nofollow">Spot Bitcoin ETF</a> market) as some others are exiting. He also suggested that some of these whales aren’t exactly leaving the market but selling their spot BTC and investing in Bitcoin ETFs instead. </p>
Bitcoin Sentiment Is Currently Bearish
<p><a href="https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData" rel="nofollow">Data</a> from Coinglass shows that the bears currently have the upper hand, with almost $82 million in <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-volatility-causes-over-300-million-in-liquidations-as-milei-moneda-is-set-to-generate-riches-for-investors/" rel="nofollow">long positions liquidated</a> in the last 24 hours compared to just about $23 million of shorts liquidated during the same period. </p>

<p>There has also been a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-open-interest-alarming-levels-brace-impact/" rel="nofollow">decrease in open interest</a> on these exchanges, which suggests that traders are choosing to stay out of the market at the moment. Therefore, activity in the derivatives market shows that the current outlook for Bitcoin is bearish, with many still expecting further declines. </p>
<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $63,000, down over 4% in the last 24 hours according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/" rel="nofollow">data</a> from CoinMarketCap. </p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />ShibaSwap的BONE代币在市场熊市中表现出色，备受关注。SHIB骑士预测其价格可能达到3美元，目前价格上涨并处于强劲的趋势中。BONE代币在过去30天内有了惊人的涨幅，目前价格为0.84美元，预计将突破3美元。为了提高BONE的市场可见性，Shiba Inu社区成员正在努力争取其在主要交易平台上的上市，这可能会为其带来大幅上涨的催化作用。 <div>
<p>Bone ShibaSwap (BONE), a token within the Shiba Inu ecosystem, has showcased remarkable resilience amidst a predominantly bearish market. Despite the downward trend, BONE has emerged as a top performer, catching the attention of community analyst SHIB Knight, who predicts further gains and a potential price target of $3.</p>

<p>SHIB Knight, a respected analyst within the Shiba Inu community, has been closely monitoring <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bone-shibaswap" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">BONE&#8217;s performance</a> and recently shared an update on the token&#8217;s outlook. Despite a previous failed breakout attempt, SHIB Knight remains optimistic, highlighting a chart that suggests BONE is now better positioned for an anticipated bullish breakout.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BONE&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">$BONE</a> is having a nice pump rn. It will pump more! <img alt="🔥" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f525.png" style="height: 1em;" /><img alt="🚀" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f680.png" style="height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/ao3YvsrJzS" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/ao3YvsrJzS</a> <a href="https://t.co/P7HbIDVkmk" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/P7HbIDVkmk</a></p>
<p>— $SHIB KNIGHT (@army_shiba) <a href="https://twitter.com/army_shiba/status/1769693757870379212?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">March 18, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>At the time of writing, BONE has experienced an impressive surge, with its price skyrocketing from a low of $0.87 to a high of $1.09. This surge represents a significant 44% gain in the monthly timeframe, accompanied by a substantial 60% increase in trading volume compared to the previous day.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-598641" height="389" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_a3a20d.png?resize=633%2C389" width="633" /></p>

<p>A Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 65 indicates that the Shiba Inu BONE Token is in a bullish trend and is seeing increased trading volumes after a spectacular 30-day rally. BONE is currently trading at $0.84.</p>
<p>While BONE&#8217;s current price hovers around $1.09, SHIB Knight has set a target price of $3, anticipating a potential 150% rally for the token. It is worth noting that the memecoin is currently down almost 98% from its all-time high in 2021, which implies ample room for growth.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/tjAjx8iK/" width="2475" /></p>

<p>The limited exposure of BONE among major centralized crypto trading platforms may have contributed to its slower price gains compared to the ecosystem&#8217;s leading token, SHIB. Currently, BONE is listed on platforms such as OKX and Gate.io, while notable exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, KuCoin, and Bybit have yet to support its trading.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I expected <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BONE&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">$BONE</a> to breakout of the channel, but it failed last time.</p>
<p>Breakout will happen sooner or later. Target is around $3 <a href="https://t.co/YJRRyST8kE" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/YJRRyST8kE</a></p>
<p>— $SHIB KNIGHT (@army_shiba) <a href="https://twitter.com/army_shiba/status/1769428146577682449?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">March 17, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>To address this limitation, leaders of the Shiba Inu community have rallied their members to campaign for BONE&#8217;s listing on Binance, one of the largest crypto exchanges. They firmly believe that inclusion on such a prominent platform would provide the necessary catalyst for explosive price rallies, potentially propelling BONE to unprecedented levels.</p>

<p>As demand for the Shiba Inu BONE Token rises and community members work strategically to achieve its listing and increase its market visibility, this positive momentum has raised investor intrigue about the token&#8217;s ability to cross the $3 threshold before the end of March.</p>
<p>Despite the inherent risks, the recent price surge of BONE and the optimistic outlook from SHIB Knight have generated excitement within the Shiba Inu community. Traders and enthusiasts will be closely monitoring BONE&#8217;s performance in the coming days, eagerly awaiting signs of a breakout and the potential for significant gains.</p>

<title>Japan’s $1.5 Trillion Pension Fund To Assess Bitcoin For Diversification</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/japans-1-5-trillion-pension-fund-assess-bitcoin/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/japans-1-5-trillion-pension-fund-assess-bitcoin/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。日本政府养老金投资基金(GPIF)正式宣布探索包括比特币在内的资产多元化机会，这标志着该基金传统上与更保守资产类别相关联的投资策略可能发生重大转变。GPIF目前处于信息请求阶段，将研究比特币和其他非传统资产的益处和风险。此举反映了该基金致力于拓宽其投资视野的努力。此外，日本日益推动比特币和加密货币投资的相关法规变化，使得投资基金能够直接持有比特币等加密货币。如果世界上最大的养老基金将比特币纳入其投资组合，这可能对其他国家和其投资战略产生重大影响。BTC目前交易价为$64,589。 <div>
<p>The Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF) of Japan, the world’s largest pension fund with assets totaling $1.5 trillion, has officially announced its initiative to explore diversification opportunities that include Bitcoin, alongside traditional investments such as gold and more unconventional assets like forests and farmland. This exploration marks a monumental potential pivot in the investment strategy of a fund traditionally associated with more conservative asset classes.</p>
<h2>Japan GPIF Seeks Information On Bitcoin</h2>
<p>According to a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.co.jp/news/articles/2024-03-19/SAKP1VT0AFB400" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">report</a> dated March 19, 2024, GPIF is in the initial phase of this exploration, focusing on an information request stage rather than signaling an imminent expansion of its investment portfolio. The fund currently diversifies its holdings across a vast array of assets, including domestic and international stocks and bonds, infrastructure, and real estate. With assets under management valued at approximately 225 trillion yen as of the end of December 2023, the GPIF&#8217;s interest in Bitcoin and other illiquid assets underscores a notable shift towards broadening its investment aperture.</p>

<p>The GPIF stated, &#8220;In addition to basic knowledge about the assets targeted for information provision, we are also seeking information on how overseas pension funds incorporate them into their portfolios and actual investment cases.&#8221; This reflects a methodical approach to understanding the potential benefits and risks associated with diversifying into less traditional and more volatile asset classes like Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Recent years have seen the GPIF actively seeking to enhance the sophistication and diversity of its portfolio. &#8220;Since the fall of 2022, a total of 56 active funds have been selected in North American, developed country, and Japanese stocks,&#8221; the GPIF noted, highlighting its ongoing efforts to refine its investment strategies. The inclusion of Bitcoin and other non-traditional assets would represent a further step in these <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/trading-bitcoin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">diversification</a> efforts.</p>
<p>However, the GPIF has cautiously noted, &#8220;This announcement is a request for information and does not indicate that the company will expand its investment targets in the future.&#8221; This statement clarifies that any decision to incorporate Bitcoin or other proposed assets into its investment strategy will depend on the outcomes of its current research phase.</p>

<p>This move by the GPIF comes amid broader regulatory changes in Japan regarding Bitcoin and crypto investments. Just one month prior to this announcement, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/japanese-government-to-ease-30-crypto-tax-requirement-a-good-move/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Japan&#8217;s administration</a>, led by Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, moved to enable investment funds to hold Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies directly. &#8220;The bill states that &#8216;measures will be taken to add crypto assets to the list of assets that can be acquired and held by investment limited partnerships,'&#8221; according to a statement from the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry.</p>
<p>The GPIF&#8217;s exploration of Bitcoin and alternative assets not only underscores the growing <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-etfs-see-record-1-billion-inflows/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">institutional interest</a> in Bitcoin, but is also in line with Japan&#8217;s regulatory advances aimed at integrating digital assets into the country&#8217;s economic framework. The potential inclusion of Bitcoin in the world&#8217;s largest pension fund would be huge news and could have implications for other countries and their investment strategies.</p>
<p>At press time, BTC traded at $64,589.</p>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。XRP价格从$0.7450阻力开始下跌，难以保持在$0.5850支撑区域以上。价格在$0.650以下交易，并且已经跌破了100四小时简单移动平均线。有一个关键的下行趋势线形成，阻力位于$0.640。如果价格能在$0.6650阻力区域收盘，可能会开始新的上涨。如果下跌，支撑位于$0.5980和$0.5850，更下方支撑位于$0.5200。技术指标显示MACD和RSI都偏于熊市。 <div>
<p><em>XRP price started a downside correction from the $0.7450 resistance. The bulls are now struggling to keep the price above the $0.5850 support zone.</em></p>

<li>The pair could start a fresh rally if there is a close above the $0.6650 resistance zone.</li>
</ul>
<h2>XRP Price Trims Gains</h2>
<p>After a steady increase, XRP price struggled to extend gains above the $0.750 resistance. The price started a downside correction from the $0.7442 high, like <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-extends-losses-3200/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ethereum</a> and <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-at-risk-65k/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin</a>.</p>
<p>There was a steady decline below the $0.700 and $0.665 support levels. The price even declined below the $0.600 support. A low was formed near $0.5874 and the price is now consolidating losses. There was a minor increase above the $0.620 level.</p>
<p>The price spiked above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.7442 swing high to the $0.5874 low. However, the bears were active near $0.650. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $0.640 on the 4-hour chart of the XRP/USD pair.</p>
<p>Ripple’s token price is now trading below $0.620 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $0.640 zone. The first key resistance is near $0.6650 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.7442 swing high to the $0.5874 low, above which the price could rise toward the $0.70 resistance.</p>

<p>Source: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/XRPUSD/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">XRPUSD on TradingView.com</a></p>
<p>A close above the $0.70 resistance zone could spark a strong increase. The next key resistance is near $0.7450. If the bulls remain in action above the $0.7450 resistance level, there could be a rally toward the $0.800 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.820 resistance.</p>
<h2>More Losses?</h2>
<p>If XRP fails to clear the $0.6650 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.5980 zone.</p>
<p>The next major support is at $0.5850. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.5850 level, the price might accelerate lower. In the stated case, the price could retest the $0.520 support zone.</p>

<title>PlanB’s Bitcoin Forecast: A Journey To $5 Million Per BTC In The Next Decade</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/planbs-bitcoin-forecast-a-journey-to-5-million/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/planbs-bitcoin-forecast-a-journey-to-5-million/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要: 这些信息是积极的。PlanB提出了关于比特币未来发展的预测，引起了加密社区的兴趣和讨论。根据S2F模型，2020-2024的减半周期预计将使比特币价格稳定在约5万美元左右。2024-2028周期将为比特币升至50万美元奠定基础，最终在2028-2032周期达到500万美元。虽然这些预测引起了争议，但PlanB指出，S2F模型虽然能指导总体趋势，但精确的未来价格预测存在较大误差。此外，文章还提到了比特币最新价格走势，显示了市场的技术分析和价格变动。 <div>
<p>PlanB, a popular name within the Bitcoin community, thanks to his Stock-to-Flow (S2F) model, has <a href="https://twitter.com/100trillionUSD/status/1769681310296035783?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">shared</a> the latest discourse on X, igniting a flurry of excitement and speculation. This discourse particularly highlights BTC&#8217;s potential journey through successive <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-sentiment-cools-price-rebound-soon/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">halving cycles</a>.</p>
<p>PlanB&#8217;s analysis, deeply rooted in the S2F model, presents a narrative for Bitcoin&#8217;s future. This model scrutinizes the correlation between an asset&#8217;s existing reserves (stock) and annual production (flow) and lays the groundwork for <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/planbs-market-cycle-analysis-bitcoin-gears-up-for-skyrocketing-beyond-100000/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">PlanB’s bold predictions</a>.</p>

<h2>Navigating Through Predictions: A Community Aweigh</h2>
<p>According to the model, the forthcoming halving cycle spanning 2020-2024 is expected to solidify Bitcoin&#8217;s price at around $50,000. But the real spectacle unfolds in the ensuing cycles, with<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-hits-support-65k/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> projections</a> setting the stage for Bitcoin to ascend to $500,000 in the 2024-2028 cycle, eventually reaching a monumental $5 million in the 2028-2032 cycle.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Stock-to-Flow 2020-2024 halving cycle: ~$50k
Stock-to-Flow 2024-2028 halving cycle: ~$500k
Stock-to-Flow 2028-2032 halving cycle: ~$5m
Yes, S2F = exponential growth, and it will continue IMO. <a href="https://t.co/rH1KmIyKSl" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/rH1KmIyKSl</a></p>

<p>The predictions made by PlanB have sparked interest and debate among the crypto community. Many are curious to see if Bitcoin will experience the forecasted substantial growth.</p>
<p>An X user responded to PlanB&#8217;s post, expressing hopefulness yet advising caution due to the limited number of data points that can&#8217;t definitively predict precise future prices, like an average of $500k from 2024 to 2028.</p>
<p>PlanB acknowledged this caution, pointing out that his predictions are based on three past halving events and the significant pre-halving period, suggesting that while the Stock-to-Flow model can guide the general trend, its accuracy comes with a considerable margin of error.</p>
<p>For instance, while the 2020-2024 period was projected to see an average of $55k, the actual figure was around $33k.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Very true. Only 3 halvings (2012, 2016 and 2020) plus the crucial pre-halving period (where BTC S2F grew from below 1 to ~4). And S2F is only for general direction, of course, and with wide error margin (for example: prediction 2020-2024 was 55k but in reality ~33k).</p>

<p>Additionally, another user in the conversation, known as Phoenix of Crypto, <a href="https://x.com/PhoenixBTC7/status/1769688309456912892?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">remarked</a> that while PlanB&#8217;s projection might seem &#8220;overly optimistic,&#8221; the true outcome remains to be seen, emphasizing the need for patience.</p>
<p>This user highlighted the uncertainty surrounding <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/planbs-triple-bitcoin-forecast-a-pre-halving-surge/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin&#8217;s future</a>, especially considering the potential impacts of ETFs and widespread adoption, signaling an open-minded but watchful approach to market developments.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Latest Price Action</h2>
<p>Bitcoin is undergoing a notable decline, having decreased by 7.5% over the last week. This downward trajectory has extended into the last 24 hours, with the cryptocurrency dropping an additional 1.5%. Despite these setbacks, Bitcoin&#8217;s trading price remains at $67,167 at the time of writing.</p>

</ul>
<h2>Bitcoin Price Faces Resistance</h2>
<p>Bitcoin price attempted a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-hits-support-65k/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">fresh increase</a> above the $65,500 zone. BTC climbed above the $67,200 and $68,000 levels. However, the bears were active near the $69,000 zone.</p>
<p>A high was formed at $68,898 and the price is now moving lower. There was a move below the $67,500 support zone. The price declined below the 50% Fib retracement level of the recovery wave from the $64,555 swing low to the $68,898 high.</p>

<title>Ether.fi $210M Airdrop Sparks Market Turbulence, ETHFI Value Drops By 35%</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ether-fi-210m-airdrop-sparks-market-turbulence-ethfi-value-drops-by-35/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ether-fi-210m-airdrop-sparks-market-turbulence-ethfi-value-drops-by-35/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要: 这些信息是积极的。文章介绍了Ether.fi的治理代币ETHFI的空投活动，吸引了约20000名参与者。虽然ETHFI的价值在空投后出现了35%的下跌，但分配策略旨在确保更广泛和更公平地分发代币。此外，Ether.fi的净存款和总锁定价值都呈现出显著增长，但活跃用户数量有所波动。总体而言，ETHFI代币的空投吸引了很多关注，而Ether.Fi生态系统中ETHFI的长期潜力和影响尚待充分实现。 <div>
<p>ETHFI, the governance token of the decentralized liquid staking protocol Ether.fi, debuted for $4.13 following its distribution through its <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-open-interest-40-crash/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">airdrop </a>on March 18. </p>
<p>However, since the $210 million airdrop, the value of ETHFI has experienced a significant decline, plummeting over 35% to its current trading price of $3.05, according to CoinGecko <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ether-fi" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">data</a>.</p>
<h2>ETHFI Airdrop Attracts 20,000 Participants</h2>
<p>Market expert Tom Wan has provided a <a href="https://x.com/tomwanhh/status/1769706615744118948?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">summary </a>of the ETHFI airdrop. Out of the total supply of 16.8 million ETHFI tokens, approximately 28% have been claimed by participants. </p>

<p>The airdrop attracted around 20,000 claimers, showcasing considerable interest in the token distribution. Notably, the top wallets, accounting for 1.67% of the total distribution, have the potential to receive between 10,000 and 25,000 <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-price-soars-10-in-reaction-to-explosive-2367-shib-burn-surge/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">ETHFI tokens</a>, reflecting substantial holdings.</p>
<img alt="Ether.fi " class="wp-image-598577 size-large" height="469" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot_80.jpg?w=860&#038;resize=860%2C469" width="860" />
<p>Most claimers, comprising approximately 67% of participants, are expected to receive a lower allocation of ETHFI tokens, ranging from 175 to 500. </p>
<p>This distribution strategy aims to ensure a broader and more equitable dispersion of the tokens among participants. However, an interesting observation is that 76% of claimers have transferred their ETHFI tokens to other wallets, indicating a potential desire for liquidity or <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-sentiment-cools-price-rebound-soon/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">trading activities</a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it is noteworthy that 38% of the token receivers are new wallets, suggesting an expansion of the ETHFI user base as of May 1, 2023. This influx of new participants showcases a growing interest in the governance and utility offered by Ether.Fi&#8217;s protocol.</p>
<h2>Ether.fi Witnesses Surge In Total Value Locked</h2>
<p>Ether.fi has experienced notable growth in net deposits and Total Value Locked (TVL), as evidenced by <a href="https://tokenterminal.com/terminal/projects/etherfi" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">data </a>provided by Token Terminal. However, the platform has faced fluctuations in its active user base. </p>
<p>According to Token Terminal, net deposits on Ether.fi have significantly increased, reaching $2.99 billion over the past 30 days alone. This marks a significant growth rate of 136.9%.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the TVL on Ether.fi has mirrored the surge in <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-approaches-risky-territory-as-halving-event-draws-near/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">net deposits</a>, which also amount to $2.99 billion over the same 30-day period. This metric represents the total value of assets, predominantly cryptocurrency, locked within the protocol. </p>
<p>However, while Ether.fi has witnessed robust growth in net deposits and TVL, the platform has experienced fluctuations in its active user base. Daily active users have shown a considerable decline of 54.3% over the past 30 days, currently standing at 506. </p>
<img alt="Ether.fi " class="wp-image-598578 size-large" height="418" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot_81.jpg?w=579&#038;resize=579%2C418" width="579" />
<p>Similarly, weekly active users have experienced a more moderate decline of 3.5%, currently standing at 5,780. This suggests that while there has been a slight reduction in user engagement every week, a significant portion of the user base remains actively involved with the protocol.</p>
<p>The most substantial decline in user activity is observed in monthly active users, with a notable drop of 68.9% over the past 30 days. The figure currently stands at 14,740 users. </p>

<p>Overall, the distribution of the ETHFI token through the airdrop has garnered significant attention and participation. At the same time, the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-threatens-to-retreat-to-60000-as-bulls-seek-solid-ground/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">token&#8217;s value</a> has experienced a decline since its initial listing, the long-term potential and impact of ETHFI within the Ether.Fi ecosystems are yet to be fully realized.</p>

<title>Is Ripple Behind The XRP Price Crash? Massive Selling Spree Sparks Concern</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/ripple-behind-xrp-price-crash/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/ripple-behind-xrp-price-crash/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的<br />文章讨论了Ripple最近转移240万XRP代币到一个未知地址的行为，引发了人们对XRP价格崩溃的担忧。进行的两次交易分别发生在3月5日和3月13日，而XRP价格在3月11日曾经上涨至0.74美元后出现急剧下跌。尽管有人认为Ripple的销售行为可能导致了价格下降，但也有人表示疑问。目前XRP价格持续下跌，市场对于这一情况的讨论仍在继续。 <div>
<p>Ripple’s occasional sale of XRP tokens has always been pinpointed as one reason for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-price-action-legal-expert/" rel="nofollow">XRP’s tepid price action</a>. Once again, the crypto firm’s recent offloading of a significant amount of XRP has raised concerns <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-will-remain-flat-even-if-bitcoin-roars/" rel="nofollow">about its negative effect</a> on the crypto token. </p>
<h2>Ripple Offloads 240 Million XRP</h2>
<p><a href="https://xrpscan.com/account/rBg2FuZT91C52Nny68houguJ4vt5x1o91m" rel="nofollow">On-chain data</a> shows that Ripple transferred a total of 240 million XRP tokens to an unknown address in two separate transactions. The first transaction occurred on March 5, when it sent 100 million XRP to the address in question. Then, on March 13, the Ripple wallet again transferred 140 million XRP to this address. </p>

<p>These transactions have raised eyebrows, and members of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-cto-burn-xrp-holdings/" rel="nofollow">XRP community</a> are contemplating whether these sales might have been the reason XRP’s price crashed recently. Notably, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-is-primed-for-growth/">the crypto token rose</a> to as high as $0.74 on March 11 before seeing a sharp correction. </p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-price-to-hit-3-4-crypto-expert-reveals-when/" rel="nofollow">XRP’s price</a> crashed on March 5, the day the first transaction was carried out. Data from CoinMarketCap shows that the crypto token, which was trading as high as $0.65 on the day, dropped to as low as $0.55 on the same day. However, it remains uncertain whether or not Ripple’s action was directly responsible for this price dip.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/39000-xrp-price-to-hit-220/" rel="nofollow">XRP’s price</a> was pretty stable on the day the second transaction occurred, although it was still declining from its weekly high of $0.7, recorded on March 11. The impact of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/ripple-xrp-sales-jump-in-2023/">Ripple’s XRP sales</a> on the market continues to be heavily debated among those in the<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrps-underperformance-ruffles-feathers-as-community-asks-ripple-to-do-something-about-price/" rel="nofollow"> XRP community</a>. </p>
<p>Pro-XRP crypto YouTuber Jerry Hall <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-expert-xrp-price-suppressed/" rel="nofollow">previously claimed</a> that Ripple was suppressing XRP’s price with its monthly sales. However, there has also been a <a href="https://blockworks.co/news/ripple-xrp-sec-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">report</a> that Ripple’s sale doesn’t impact prices on crypto exchanges. </p>
<h2>If Not Ripple, Then Who?</h2>
<p>Ripple’s price action defies logic, especially considering that the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-ceo-success-for-xrp/" rel="nofollow">token’s fundamentals </a>and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/parabolic-breakout-xrp-price/" rel="nofollow">technical analysis</a> suggest it is well primed for a parabolic move. That is why talks about possible market manipulation continue to persist. It is also understandable that all fingers instantly point to Ripple since they are the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/top-10-xrp-wallets-11-supply/" rel="nofollow">largest XRP holders</a>. </p>

<p>However, if Ripple is indeed not responsible for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-will-remain-flat-even-if-bitcoin-roars/" rel="nofollow">XRP’s stagnant price action</a>, then there needs to be another explanation for why XRP has continued to underperform. Although the crypto token has continued to rank in the top 10 largest crypto tokens by market cap, it is worth mentioning that it is one of few tokens that has a negative year-to-date (YTD) gain. </p>
<p>At the time of writing, XRP is trading at around $0.61, up in the last 24 hours according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/xrp/" rel="nofollow">data</a> from CoinMarketCap. </p>

<title>Bitcoin Has Undergone This Bearish Structure Change, Analyst Explains</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。最近比特币的Coinbase溢价差持续为负值，表明大型美国实体正在出售比特币。这反映在比特币价格下跌近9％至约67300美元。分析显示，美国机构交易商今年推动了价格行动，当前的熊市结构可能使价格无法积累太多上行动力。愿景不明朗。 <div>
<p>An analyst has explained that the recent trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap suggests a significant change in the asset&#8217;s structure.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap Has Continued To Be Negative</h2>
<p>In a new <a href="https://twitter.com/JA_Maartun/status/1769722321609101793" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, analyst Maartunn discussed how the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap is still negative. The &#8220;Coinbase Premium Gap&#8221; here refers to a metric that tracks the difference between the Bitcoin prices listed on cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase (USD pair) and Binance (USDT pair).</p>

<p>This indicator&#8217;s value provides hints about how the behavior of the former&#8217;s userbase currently differs from that of the latter platform.</p>
<p>Below is the chart shared by the analyst that reveals the trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap since the start of the year.</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="2580" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GI9REFQXAAA9MLp?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096" width="4096" /></p>

<p>As the graph shows, the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap had been mostly positive as Bitcoin had gone through its journey from $44,000 to beyond the $73,000 level.</p>
<p>This would imply that the price listed on the exchange was higher than on Binance during this period. Such a trend naturally suggests that the buying pressure on the former was greater than on the latter.</p>
<p>Coinbase is widely known to be the preferred platform of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/institutionals-bitcoin-fomo-coinbase-premium/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">US-based institutional investors</a>, while Binance has global traffic. Thus, the green positive premium values would imply these large American entities had been buying and supporting the rally.</p>
<p>Recently, however, the indicator&#8217;s value turned negative as these investors took to selling instead. Since then, the metric has continued to assume such values. Alongside this selloff, the BTC price has experienced a notable decline.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap followed a similar pattern during the first month or so of the year. In the first 10 days of January, the metric had been positive as buying had occurred in anticipation of the<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-etfs-see-record-1-billion-inflows/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs)</a>. Still, after the ETFs had been approved, the indicator had turned negative.</p>

<p>The red premium values had maintained for a few weeks, during which the cryptocurrency price had struggled. Based on this pattern and the recent trend, it would seem that American institutional traders have driven the price action this year.</p>
<p>As such, so long as the current bearish structure in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap exists, it&#8217;s possible that the price may not be able to amass too much upward momentum.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>At the end of the positive Coinbase Premium Gap streak, Bitcoin had been able to achieve a new all-time high above $73,800, but as traders have switched to selling on the platform, the coin has dropped almost 9%, with its price now trading around $67,300.</p>

<title>Profit-Taking Panic, Short-Term Bitcoin Holders Sell Off – What’s Next For BTC?</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/profit-taking-panic-short-term-bitcoin-holders/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。最近的区块链数据显示了一个重要趋势：持有比特币不到五个月的投资者正在大量获利。这种短期持有者为了获利而清仓的现象反映了先前牛市高峰时期的模式。此外，引入了BTC现货交易所交易基金（ETF）可能会平衡市场动态，缓解短期持有者获利行为的不良影响。预计RIAs市场的资金流入将带来积极需求冲击，增加比特币的投资。同时，BTC的供需动态显示出不断增长的需求对减少供应的压力。<br /> <div>
<p>Recent on-chain data <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptoquant_com/status/1769516442729533668?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">highlighted</a> a significant trend: a wave of profit-taking by investors who have held Bitcoin (BTC) for less than five months.</p>
<p>As detailed by CryptoQuant&#8217;s latest data, this phenomenon is not just a random market movement but an echo of patterns observed at the zeniths of previous bull markets.</p>

<h2>Profit-Taking Among Short-Term Bitcoin Holders Signals Market Shift</h2>
<p>According to CryptoQuant, the Spent Output Profit Ratio (SOPR), a key metric in evaluating the profit and loss of Bitcoin transactions over a specific period, showcases a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-sentiment-cools-price-rebound-soon/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">pronounced uptick</a> indicative of widespread profit realization.</p>
<p>This tendency among short-term holders to liquidate their holdings for gains parallels historical market peaks and suggests a critical juncture for Bitcoin.</p>

<h2>New Market Forces At Play: ETFs Inflow Set To Rebalance The Equation</h2>
<p>While the SOPR metric might signal alarm bells reminiscent of past <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-hits-support-65k/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">bull market peaks</a>, the crypto landscape is underpinned by factors that could mitigate the traditional outcomes of such profit-taking.</p>
<p>Among these is the recent introduction of a BTC spot Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF). This new avenue for Bitcoin investment introduces a complex layer to the market&#8217;s dynamics, potentially cushioning any adverse effects of short-term holders&#8217; profit-taking activities.</p>
<p>Dan concluded by <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/65f6b4e4afc8f17fcb7e6924-BTC-short-term-investors-took-large-profits?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=sns&amp;utm_campaign=quicktake&amp;utm_content=crypto-dan" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">noting</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>But considering the BTC spot ETF and potential additional inflows from institutions and individuals, it is difficult to judge it as simply a signal of the peak of a bull market. After a short-term correction period, it&#8217;s very likely that we will see a strong further bull in 2024.</p></blockquote>
<p>CoinShares Head of Research, James Butterfill, <a href="https://blog.coinshares.com/the-bitcoin-demand-shock-5be12c1738b3" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">provides</a> a further layer of analysis, suggesting an imminent &#8220;positive demand shock&#8221; for Bitcoin. According to Butterfill, the delay in making spot Bitcoin ETFs accessible to the Registered Investment Advisors (RIA) market — a sector managing around $50 trillion in assets — is set to end.</p>
<p>With RIAs requiring three months of<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-threatens-to-retreat-to-60000-as-bulls-seek-solid-ground/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> trading data</a> before including new ETFs in their portfolios, the market is on the cusp of witnessing a substantial influx of new investments into Bitcoin. &#8220;If 10% of RIAs chose to invest 1% of their portfolios, this could result in approximately $50 billion in additional inflows,&#8221; Butterfill elaborated, highlighting the scale of potential market impact.</p>
<p>Moreover, the current supply-demand dynamics within the Bitcoin <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-approaches-risky-territory-as-halving-event-draws-near/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">market are skewed</a> towards increasing demand against decreasing supply.</p>

<p>The daily demand for BTC, fueled by the trade of spot BTC ETFs and the average production of new coins, underscores a growing discrepancy that ETF issuers are filling by <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-crashes-dip-to-65000-triggers-over-400-million-liquidation-avalanche/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">tapping into the secondary market</a>.</p>
<p>This scenario is evidenced by a dramatic decrease in OTC desk coin holdings, a direct consequence of ETF-driven demand, according to Butterfill.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Whales Enter Full Accumulation Mode: Here’s How Much BTC They Pulled From Exchanges</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-whales-btc-exchanges/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-whales-btc-exchanges/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章指出上周比特币价格波动，由于大量比特币从交易所撤出，大型投资者预计价格将进一步上涨。数据显示，过去一周已有21,401枚比特币从交易所转移。另外，13名新的持有超过1,000个比特币的大鲸鱼加入。此外，3月15日比特币从交易所取出的金额达到5.75亿美元，是自2023年5月以来的最高点。尽管市场信心略有下降，但通过大量比特币的撤离来看，大鲸鱼似乎在为持续的涨势做准备。 <div>
<p>The Bitcoin price movement last week revealed a series of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-crashes-dip-to-65000-triggers-over-400-million-liquidation-avalanche/">ups and downs</a>, from starting the week at a new all-time high of  $73,780 to crashing 12% in the days after to reach below $65,000. Crypto data analysts have spotted massive amounts of Bitcoin being withdrawn from major exchanges during the period of uncertainty, indicating that large investors anticipate further price appreciation. </p>
<p>According to a social media post by crypto analyst Ali Martinez, the total BTC balance on crypto exchanges fell by over 21,400 in the past week, with the creation of 13 new whales, each holding over 1,000 BTC.</p>
<h2>BTC Withdrawal From Exchanges</h2>
<p>Bitcoin crossed over $73,700 last week to register a new all-time high but has struggled to gain a footing above the price level. Interestingly, it would seem the new all-time high sparked a wave of profit-taking from some investors. However, on-chain and exchange data indicate Bitcoin is still undergoing a bullish sentiment from some investors, particularly large investors. </p>

<p>Crypto analyst Ali Martinez noted this bull accumulation pattern in a post on his social media platform X. According to a Glassnode chart shared by the analyst, the total amount of BTC on exchanges has been on a free-fall since the middle of January. Notably, the total BTC balance saw a brief increase in the first few days of March before resuming a free-fall on March 5. In the past week alone, 21,401 BTC were moved off crypto exchanges. </p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Similarly, the crypto analytics platform IntoTheBlock noted this outflow pattern during the week. According to ITB, BTC withdrawal from crypto exchanges reached its highest point this year on March 15. Interestingly, $750 million worth of Bitcoin was withdrawn on this day, the highest since May 2023.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Over $750m <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">$BTC</a> was withdrawn from exchanges yesterday, the highest since May 2023. The majority of these withdrawals originate from Bitfinex ($524m) and Kraken ($130m) <a href="https://t.co/8d3eIJROhv" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/8d3eIJROhv</a></p>
<p>— IntoTheBlock (@intotheblock) <a href="https://twitter.com/intotheblock/status/1768592828362289234?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">March 15, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<h2>What Does This Mean For Bitcoin?</h2>
<p>The Bitcoin ecosystem has witnessed serious money on the move since the beginning of the year, leading to a strong price surge for the cryptocurrency. However, this rally has since slowed down to spark a price correction, with market sentiment <a href="https://x.com/ali_charts/status/1769049306827272609?s=20" rel="nofollow">reaching the most negative sentiment</a> toward BTC since December 2023. Bitcoin is currently trading at $68,201, down by 3.44% in the past seven days. </p>

<p>After such a strong surge in price, it’s normal for the momentum to slow down as the market consolidates and decides on the next move. While momentum has slowed, the overall trend for <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-hits-support-65k/">Bitcoin remains bullish</a>. </p>
<p>Judging by the massive amounts of Bitcoin pulled from exchanges recently, it looks like whales are gearing up for a continued rally. <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-a-decades-long-investment-ceo-says-despite-recent-downturn/" rel="nofollow">Bitcoin is now showing signs</a> of a rally, and is now up by 5% in the past 24 hours. </p>

<title>Arbitrum Whales Are HODLing; Why Are ARB Prices Tanking?</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/arbitrum-whales-hodling-arb-prices-tanking/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/arbitrum-whales-hodling-arb-prices-tanking/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />最近解锁的ARB触发了抛售担忧，但Lookonchain数据显示出不同的情况。仅有58百万ARB被11个大型投资者发送到交易所，显示出其他鲸鱼持有着他们的ARB，对项目的未来充满信心。尽管价格下跌，但持有者保持乐观，而Dencun升级对Arbitrum的发展也有利。 Arbitrum继续领先于第二层扩展解决方案，在总锁定价值方面胜过Optimism。 <div>
<p>While the recent unlocking of ARB triggered fears of a sell-off, Lookonchain data suggests a different story. On March 18, the analytics platform <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1769586523639562691" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">showed</a> that a mere 58 million ARB, representing only a tiny portion of the 1.1 billion tokens unlocked on March 16, were sent to exchanges by just 11 large-scale investors, commonly called &#8220;whales.&#8221;</p>
<img alt="ARB whales transferred coins to exchanges | Source: ARBUSDT on Binance, TradingView" class="size-full wp-image-598523" height="668" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GI7Vb57aAAA61XH.png?resize=1024%2C668" width="1024" />
<h2>Are Whales Bullish On ARB? </h2>
<p>This transfer indicates that despite some profit-taking, other whales are HODLing on to their ARB, reflecting continued confidence in the project&#8217;s future. </p>
<p>On March 16, Arbitrum <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://token.unlocks.app/arbitrum" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">sent</a> 1.1 billion ARB to investors, team members, and advisors in a &#8220;Cliff Unlock.&#8221; Analysts describe a &#8220;Cliff Unlock&#8221; as a situation in which all allocated tokens for that event are released simultaneously.</p>

<p>Arbitrum chose to release all tokens at once. 673.5 million were sent to advisors and the team. Meanwhile, the remainder, 438.25 million, was sent to investors. The unlocking event, as expected, was a source of concern that some receivers would choose to sell in the secondary market. </p>
<p>As expected, ARB prices have decreased, reflecting the general sentiment across the crypto market board. So far, ARB is down 24% from March 2024 highs. However, what&#8217;s clear is that the uptrend remains, and buyers remain in charge despite the selling pressure.</p>
<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/x/dsNW23i2/" rel="nofollow"><img alt="Arbitrum prices trending downward on the daily chart | Source: ARBUSDT on Binance, TradingView" class="size-full" height="904" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/dsNW23i2/" width="1787" /></a>
<p>Based purely on price action, ARB bulls have a chance if prices are above the $1.6 to $1.65 support zone. Conversely, any upswing above this level might drive prices to the upper end of the range at around $2.20. Further upswings will continue the sharp expansion from October 2023. At the time of writing, ARB is up 125% from Q4 2023 lows.</p>
<h2>Arbitrum To Benefit From Dencun, Cementing Its Layer-2 Dominance</h2>
<p>Lookonchain data shows that only a few tokens were sent to exchanges less than a week after the unlocking event, suggesting investors and whales are bullish about the project. </p>
<p>L2Beat data <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://l2beat.com/scaling/summary" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">shows</a> that Arbitrum, a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum, is the largest in that category by total value locked (TVL). By March 18, Arbitrum managed $14.7 billion worth of assets, nearly 2X that of Optimism.</p>
<img alt="Arbitrum TVL | Source: L2Beat" class="size-full wp-image-598521" height="434" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot591.png?resize=893%2C434" width="893" />
<p>While ARB is under pressure, the broader Ethereum and crypto community remains bullish. Last week, the &#8220;Dencun&#8221; update was released to the mainnet. </p>

<p>This update is significant as it further slashes transaction fees, making layer-2s, including Arbitrum, more attractive for users. This upgrade is especially appealing to developers and users seeking to enjoy the high on-chain activity on Ethereum without struggling with high gas fees and low scalability. As Layer-2 solutions find adoption, Arbitrum could benefit from this influx.</p>

<title>Arbitrum Token Sell-Off: Whales Transfer $58M To Exchanges Following Unlock, ARB Price Reacts</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。Layer 2协议Arbitrum (ARB)解锁了11亿个令牌，导致其本地令牌价值下跌。11只大鲸鱼将价值5800万美元的ARB令牌存入交易所出售。Wintermute交易公司连续两天存入ARB令牌，可能用于出售。ARB令牌自其创下的2.39美元历史高点以来已经下跌了29%。解锁后，ARB的价格出现了3%的上涨，但循序渐进地下跌，21天后达到-21%的低点。然而，约在25天后，价格开始大幅恢复，超过解锁当天水平19%。过去的模式显示，虽然ARB可能面临解锁后的初期压力，但在接下来的几周内可能会出现恢复和积极的价格走势。 <div>
<p>On Saturday, March 16, the Layer 2 protocol Arbitrum (ARB) unlocked 1.1 billion <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/arbitrum/arbitrum-beats-ethereum-and-solana-with-119-surge-in-nft-sales-nft-resurgence-on-the-horizon/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">ARB tokens</a> as part of its 2024 roadmap. This event led to a significant decline in the native token&#8217;s value, with losses of up to 18% reported over the past week. </p>
<p>In the past 24 hours, more whales have been sending ARB tokens to exchanges for selling, indicating a potential further drop in the protocol&#8217;s prices. This token unlocking marks the beginning of a four-year phased process, releasing a specific number of tokens every four weeks until 2027.</p>
<h2>11 Whales Dump $58 Million Worth Of ARB Tokens</h2>
<p>Following the massive unlocking of ARB tokens, analysis firm Lookonchain <a href="https://x.com/lookonchain/status/1769586523639562691?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">revealed </a>that 11 whales deposited 34 million ARB tokens (equivalent to $58 million) into exchanges. </p>
<p>Additionally, on-chain data provider &#8220;The Data Nerd&#8221; <a href="https://x.com/OnchainDataNerd/status/1769381905244529099?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">noted </a>that trading firm Wintermute has been continuously depositing ARB tokens for the past 48 hours, potentially for selling purposes. </p>
<p>The data provider notes that digital asset trading firm Wintermute now holds only 7.22 million ARB tokens worth $12.35 million, indicating that they have already deposited or sold $18.12 million worth of ARB over the past few days.</p>

<p>The ARB token has been on a 29% downtrend since reaching its all-time high (ATH) of $2.39 on June 12, 2024. Following the unlock event, ARB traded as high as $1.96 but dipped to $1.61 within 48 hours. </p>
<p>The token has managed to reclaim the $1.68 level despite being in the red zone over the past 24 hours if the price drops further, ARB&#8217;s potential support walls are identified at $1.56, $1.46, and potentially as low as $1.32.</p>
<h2>Arbitrum Post-Unlock Journey </h2>
<p>NewsBTC <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/arbitrum/arbitrum-arb-faces-potential-selling-pressure-as-1-billion-tokens-become-unlocked-in-march/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">reported</a> that there has been only one previous unlock event for ARB tokens. On the first day after the unlock, ARB experienced a 3% increase, indicating positive market sentiment and initial demand. </p>
<p>However, the token&#8217;s price gradually declined, reaching a low of -21% approximately 21 days after the unlock event. Interestingly, around the 25-day mark, the price began significantly recovering, surging by 19% above the unlock-day level. </p>
<p>These patterns suggest that while Arbitrum may face initial downward pressure post-unlock, there is potential for recovery and positive price movement in the following weeks.</p>

<p>The future trajectory of ARB&#8217;s price action remains uncertain despite experiencing a 15% drop from its first unlock day. Drawing from the past <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/uniswap/uniswap-expands-reach-deploys-v2-protocol-on-six-new-chains-including-arbitrum-and-polygon/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">unlock event</a>, if historical patterns hold, there may be a further 6% decrease, aligning with the previous 21% drop observed 25 days after the first Arbitrum unlock event. </p>
<p>This hypothetical scenario would place Arbitrum at $1.57, indicating a favorable mid-term <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/arbitrum/buy-sell-trade-arbitrum-network/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">uptrend structure</a>.</p>
<p>However, it is crucial to note that past patterns do not guarantee identical outcomes in current price trading. Nevertheless, analyzing historical data can provide valuable insights and help understand and assess potential price movements.</p>

<title>Solana Surpasses Ethereum In Major Metric Amid Surge Above $200</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-ethereum-surge-200/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-ethereum-surge-200/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。Solana在加密货币领域变得越来越流行，网络活动超过了以太坊。3月16日，Solana的网络活动大幅增加，超过了以太坊的日交易量。网络容量达到极限，导致交易失败和ping时间增加。Solana的价格也在上涨，市值稳步接近1000亿美元。随着对Solana的兴趣和需求增加，其在市值排名上成功跻身第四位，并创下了全球谷歌搜索兴趣的新高。 <div>
<p>Solana has recently become one of the trendiest cryptocurrencies in the space, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-sol-massive-870-premium/">capturing the interest </a>of both crypto investors and enthusiasts in the space. The popular cryptocurrency has witnessed a significant <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-sol-transaction-volume-breaks-the-charts/" rel="nofollow">surge in network activity</a>, surpassing even that of Ethereum, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency. </p>
<h2>Solana Outpaces Ethereum Network Activity</h2>
<p>On March 16, Solana experienced a major increase in its overall network activity, pushing its capacity to its limits amidst the growing demands. The network had surged past <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-ethereum-trading-volume-over-40-billion/" rel="nofollow">Ethereum’s total trading volume</a> and exceeded its daily trading volume by more than $1.1 billion, according to <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Solana" rel="nofollow">data</a> by DefilLama.   </p>

<p>Specifically, Solana’s 24-hour <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana-defi-landscape-thrives-with-record-11-billion-trading-volume/">trading volume</a> had recorded almost $3 billion, surging past Ethereum’s daily volume of $2.04 billion. During the surge, the network witnessed an unprecedented amount of trading activities, which resulted in failed transactions and a surge in ping times. </p>
<p>As <a href="https://explorer.solana.com/" rel="nofollow">highlighted</a> by Solana Validator, the cryptocurrency network’s ping time on March 18, had jumped to a staggering 46 seconds, causing about a 30% to 40% failed transactions. The validator’s report also revealed a steady and rapid increase in <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-transaction-volumes-700-200/" rel="nofollow">Solanan’s transaction count</a>, recording over 276 million transactions at the time of writing, with about 2,107 transactions per second. </p>
<p>This rise in <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/from-outage-to-recovery-solana-price-bounces-back-with-network-restart-in-full-swing/">Solana’s network activity</a> has been attributed to the surge in interest in <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/god-candle-solana-meme-coin/">Solana-based meme coins</a>. On Thursday, March 14, degens eagerly sought after a new meme coin called <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/meme-coin/introducing-book-of-meme-bome-the-latest-1-billion-crypto-sensation/">Book of Meme (BOME)</a>, which had experienced an unprecedented bullish spike that triggered its market capitalization to rise from almost zero to a staggering $1.45 billion. </p>
<p>During these periods, the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-price-will-climb-to-750/">price of Solana</a> also rallied alongside, witnessing an unexpected price surge that propelled it by more than 30% in the past week. The cryptocurrency has been on a steady momentum since the beginning of the year, displaying slight <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/company/solana-price-drops-as-altcoin-market-falters-is-it-too-late-to-buy-sol/">price corrections</a> before continuing on its upward trajectory. </p>
<h2>SOL Price Rides The Bullish Wave</h2>
<p>Amidst Solana’s burgeoning popularity and rising transaction volumes, the cryptocurrency saw a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/sol-price-crosses-200/">price increase to more than $200</a>, reflecting a daily surge of approximately 8.9%, at the time of writing. The cryptocurrency’s <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-market-cap-1000-crypto-fund-ceo/">market capitalization</a> is also up by 11.10%, recording over $89 billion and steadily closing towards the $100 billion mark. </p>

<p>Due to its overwhelming network activities and <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solanas-biggest-memecoin-gains-681000-in-3-days-as-more-investors-bet-on-its-popularity/">growing popularity</a>, Solana has successfully gained the position of the 4th largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-chasing-bnb-chain-race-to-5-market-dominance-heats-up/">overtaking BNB Chain (BNB)</a> by more than four billion, according to CoinMarketCap. </p>
<p>Moreover, the cryptocurrency has <a href="https://x.com/solanafloor/status/1769599178013823394?s=46" rel="nofollow">reached</a> peak levels globally in terms of Google search interest,  hitting a new all-time high. This surge has been attributed to the increasing interest and demand for the popular digital asset. </p>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。新的Solana基于项目Slerf (SLERF)在推出后遭遇了问题，大部分代币供应在意外中被烧毁。项目的发起人在试图烧毁流动性池中的代币时出现错误，导致预售参与者的代币也被烧毁。鲸鱼利用这一情况赚取了数百万美元，引发社区的质疑。发起人承诺寻找方式来偿还预售参与者，但SLERF的价值在发布后波动不定。 <div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A new <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-tokens-among-top-gainers-jup-and-wen-soar-over-12-wif-hits-new-ath/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Solana-based</a> memecoin launched today, becoming the talk of the town, and whales have noticed it. However, the reasons behind this might be different from what everybody expects.</p>
<p>Since its launch, Slerf (SLERF), the newest Solana-based project, has been trending for all the wrong reasons. The project successfully raised $10 million during its presale and saw most of the token supply burned by accident.</p>



<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Solana Memecoin Launch Sees Millions Gone</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Just a few hours ago, the Slerf creator and the presale investors were full of excitement and expectation as the token’s launch approached. Everything appeared normal as the project’s X account <a href="https://twitter.com/Slerfsol/status/1769620303229952445" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> it had successfully burned $10.8 million worth of SLERF.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">For context, the project’s website states that the “slerfnomics” included a total supply yet to be determined, with 50% of the tokens to be sent into the Liquidity Pool (LP) and 50% for the presale participant’s airdrop. Additionally, the tokens in the LP would be burned at launch, and ownership would be revoked.</p>
<p><img alt="slerf, memecoin, sol" class="size-large wp-image-598533 aligncenter" height="310" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Captura-de-Pantalla-2024-03-18-a-las-7.41.15-a.-m.png?w=860&#038;resize=860%2C310" width="860" /></p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">However, investors seemed confused about the amount burned and where the airdrop tokens would come from. Before realizing their mistake, the creator explained that the airdrop to the presale participants wasn’t done before the burn because “it was the safest way.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The community quickly <a href="https://x.com/devtonic_sol/status/1769620999212028259?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">realized</a> that something had gone wrong, as it seemed the project’s team had no tokens left for the airdrop. The creator realized the mistake shortly after and announced it on X while apologizing.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">“Guys I fucked up. I burned the LP and the tokens that were set aside for the airdrop,” the <a href="https://twitter.com/Slerfsol/status/1769628592315748403" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> read. He further explained that the mistake was a “simple mindless misclick” while burning the LP.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It was further explained that after the first attempt to <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/shiba-inu-mania-price-surges-60-as-burn-rate-heats-up-by-over-22000/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">burn</a> the tokens failed, the creator checked the Sol incinerator and couldn’t see the LP tokens. As a result, he decided to clean the wallet of the “shitcoins” sent there. This action accidentally burned the presale token’s supply alongside the other tokens.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The mistake proved irreversible as the minting authority had already been revoked. Neither the creator nor the developers could access the burned tokens or mint new ones for the presale participants.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">From Sloths To Whales: Millions Made In 12 Minutes</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Whales took the opportunity to profit big on this Solana-based memecoin drama, as reported by Lookonchain.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The blockchain research platform <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1769663277561430111" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">revealed</a> that a whale wallet with over $32 million worth of SOL spent $606,000 (3,024 SOL) to buy 1.7 million SLERF. This wallet had never bought any tokens, and its newly acquired SLERF accounted for $1.5 million in unrealized profits a couple of hours ago.</p>

<p></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A different whale wallet spent 9,894 SOL (worth $1.98 million) to buy almost 70 million SLERF immediately after opening trading. In 12 minutes, the trader sold the memecoin for 25,001 SOL (worth around $5 million) and made over $3 million <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/pepe-whale-makes-8-13m-in-profit-as-bullish-rally-continues/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">in profit</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">However, these transactions raised the alarms of the presale investor and the community. Doubts of the “accidental burn of tokens” being much more than a mistake are high, as replies to the post suggest.  Many users believe these movements to be from “insiders” and not “lucky people.”</p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Slerf creator <a href="https://x.com/Slerfsol/status/1769710069581512822?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">guaranteed</a> it was an honest mistake during an X Space session. He also stated his principal concern was to make things right for those who saw their investment vanish.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, he committed to finding a way to refund the presale participants. As of this writing, Slerf is live on X Space, asking the community for suggestions on how to repay them.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The SLERF pumped to $1.24 after its launch, over 43.4% in an hour. The token’s price has decreased by over 52%, trading at $0.59 at writing time.</p>

<title>Standard Chartered Predicts Bitcoin At $150,000, ETH At $8,000 By Year-End</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />Standard Chartered银行的最新研究对比特币（BTC）和以太坊（ETH）提供了非常看涨的展望，预计到2024年底甚至更长时间，比特币可能达到15万美元，而以太坊可能达到8000美元。银行的研究深入探讨了推动比特币可能飙升至15万美元的因素，包括比特币现货交易所交易基金（ETF）的推出和以太坊最近的Dencun升级。银行认为，这些三项关键分析为Standard Chartered对比特币估值奠定了基石。银行还预测了以太坊到2024年底可能达到8000美元的路径，这取决于Dencun升级和预计的ETH现货ETF批准。展望到2025年及以后，银行认为ETH对比BTC的价格比率将回到7%水平，预计以太坊价格将在2025年底达到14000美元。<br /> <div>
<p>Standard Chartered&#8217;s latest research <a href="https://twitter.com/FinBizJedi/status/1769667188439560483" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">notes</a> offer a very bullish outlook for the major digital assets, Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), by the end of 2024 and beyond. The bank&#8217;s analysts project Bitcoin could reach $150,000, while Ethereum could hit the $8,000 mark.</p>
<p>These projections come amidst a backdrop of significant developments in the crypto space, including the launch of Bitcoin spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and Ethereum&#8217;s recent Dencun upgrade.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin&#8217;s Path To $150,000</h2>
<p>The bank&#8217;s research delves deep into the factors propelling Bitcoin&#8217;s potential surge to $150,000 by year-end. Central to this projection is the influence of Bitcoin spot ETFs, which, since their <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/breaking-news-ticker/breaking-sec-approves-all-11-spot-bitcoin-etfs-btc-price-holds-steady-at-46000/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">launch on January 11</a>, have seen rapid inflows exceeding increases in open interest.</p>

<p>According to the bank, this suggests a more robust and sustainable positioning for Bitcoin, distinct from previous speculative peaks. &#8220;Rapid inflows to the new Bitcoin (BTC) spot ETFs have dominated [&#8230;] Most of the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitwise-ceo-bitcoin-ipo-moment-what-it-means-for-price/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">inflows are likely to be sticky</a> pension-type flows,&#8221; Geoff Kendrick and Suki Cooper elucidate, highlighting the newfound stability in Bitcoin investment trends.</p>
<p>Three pivotal analyses form the cornerstone of Standard Chartered&#8217;s Bitcoin valuation:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Gold Analogy:</strong> Drawing parallels with the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/cathie-wood-bitcoin-gold/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">gold market&#8217;s response</a> to the introduction of US gold ETFs, the bank estimates Bitcoin could rise to the $200,000 level, marking a 4.3x increase from its pre-ETF price.</li>
<li><strong>Two-Asset Optimization:</strong> By optimizing a portfolio with 80% gold and 20% Bitcoin at current gold prices, the analysis suggests a Bitcoin level around $190,000.</li>
<li><strong>ETF Inflows Correlation:</strong> Linear extrapolation based on the correlation between ETF inflows and Bitcoin price points to a possible $250,000 level, assuming total ETF inflows around the bank&#8217;s midpoint estimate of $75 billion.</li>
</ol>
<p>Standard Chartered notes that these three measures suggest “that $200,000 is the &#8216;correct&#8217; end-2025 price level for BTC, [&#8230;] and that it is likely to be the new midpoint for a sideways trading range at that time.”</p>

<p>Further the research notes that an “overshoot to $250,000 is likely at some point in 2025 if ETF inflows continue apace and/or reserve managers buy BTC.” Previously, the bank only <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/mark-your-calendars-bitcoin-to-hit-100000-by-end-of-2024-standard-chartered-says/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">predicted</a> a Bitcoin price of $100,000 by the end of 2024.</p>
<h2>Ethereum&#8217;s Road To $8,000</h2>
<p>Ethereum&#8217;s expected climb to $8,000 by the end of 2024 is anchored in two transformative developments: the Dencun upgrade and the expected approval of ETH spot ETFs. The recent <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/dencun-upgrade-officially-deployed-on-ethereum-mainnet-eth-price-holds-steady-below-4000/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Dencun upgrade</a>, by significantly lowering transaction costs on layer 2 blockchains, enhances Ethereum&#8217;s competitive edge.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ethereum (ETH) has just undergone the ‘Dencun’ upgrade, which dramatically lowers the cost of transactions [&#8230;] making ETH more competitive,&#8221; the research notes.</p>
<p>The forecast also hinges on the anticipation of US SEC approval for ETH ETFs by May 23, a decision poised to catalyze substantial inflows into Ethereum. Drawing from the Bitcoin ETF experience, Standard Chartered expects similar enthusiasm for Ethereum, with projected inflows of 2.39-9.15 million ETH (equivalent to roughly $15-45 billion).</p>
<p>This substantial capital infusion is seen as a crucial lever for Ethereum&#8217;s price surge. &#8220;We expect significant ETF-driven inflows to ETH [&#8230;] This could drive ETH to the $8,000 level by end-2024,&#8221; the bank elaborates, underscoring the parallel potential for growth akin to Bitcoin&#8217;s trajectory.</p>
The Prognosis For 2025 And Beyond
<p>Looking further ahead, Standard Chartered ventures into the terrain of 2025 predictions, where the bank sees the ETH-to-BTC price ratio ascending back to the 7% level, a hallmark of the 2021-22 period.</p>
<p>This adjustment forecasts an Ethereum price of $14,000 by the end of 2025, given the projected Bitcoin level of $200,000. Such a scenario underscores the bank&#8217;s optimism about the enduring value proposition and growth potential of these leading digital assets in the medium term.</p>
<p>At press time, BTC traded at $68,401.</p>

<title>Shiba Inu Open Interest Suffers 40% Crash, What Does This Mean For Price?</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-open-interest-40-crash/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-open-interest-40-crash/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。<br />Shiba Inu的开放利益经历了一次急剧下跌，下跌超过40％。这表明对该加密货币的兴趣正在减少，可能导致价格下跌。历史数据显示，开放利益的下降通常会与价格下跌相一致。然而，当前的牛市周期仍处于早期阶段，可能有更多需求来避免价格崩盘。 <div>
<p class="p2">The Shiba Inu open interest has hit a snag after a particularly good run. The open interest had <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/forget-dogecoin-shiba-inu-set-to-become-the-top-dog-expert-predicts-100-billion-market-cap/">risen quickly alongside the price</a> of the meme coin, which climbed close to its previous all-time high earlier in March. However, the cryptocurrency has been unable to maintain this uptrend, leading to a significant drop in the open interest.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Shiba Inu Open Interest Sees Over 40% Decline</h2>
<p class="p2">According to <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/BitcoinOpenInterest" rel="nofollow">data</a> from Coinglass, the Shiba Inu open interest had hit a new two-year high on March 6 when its price crossed over the $0.000032 threshold. Since then, however, it has been on a decline, seeing a near-constant decline each day since.</p>

<p class="p2">By Monday, March 18, the Shiba Inu open interest had dropped from its $135 million all-time high to just $80 million. This decline translates to an over 40% decrease in the space of two weeks. At the same time, the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/crypto-analyst-shiba-inu-target/">price of the meme coin</a> has followed the same trend and has dropped from its yearly highs above $0.00004 to $0.000028 at the time of writing.</p>
<p class="p2">Now, the open interest for any cryptocurrency is important because it serves as a measure of the total interest in that asset at any given time. It basically shows the total number of all futures and/or options contracts for a particular asset. So in this case, it shows the amount of money invested in <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-whales-shib/">SHIB</a> derivative products at any time.</p>
<p class="p2">Given this, an increase in the open interest can be bullish for a cryptocurrency such as Shiba Inu, while a decrease can be bearish. This is because, the lower the open interest, the less money is being put into that particular asset, thereby decreasing the demand. So this could negatively affect the price.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Will SHIB Price Continue To Decline?</h2>
<p class="p2">As seen historically, a decline in open interest has often coincided with a decline in price. As such, the present decline being experienced by Shiba Inu could spell bad news for its price going forward. The effect is already being felt with the price of SHIB dropping significantly over the weekend, although it has started to recover as the new week opens up.</p>

<p class="p2">To get an idea of where the price might be headed next, we can take a look at the last time that the Shiba Inu open interest was this high, back in 2021. The open interest had reached its current all-time high in October 2021, but after peaking, both the open interest and the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-whales-shib/">SHIB price</a> would suffer tremendously.</p>
<p class="p2">Over the course of the next few months, the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/forget-dogecoin-shiba-inu-set-to-become-the-top-dog-expert-predicts-100-billion-market-cap/">SHIB price</a> would fall more than 50%, following the same trend as the open interest. If this trend were to continue this time around, then the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-whales-shib/">SHIB price</a> may be headed for a price crash.</p>
<p class="p2">However, 2021 marked the end of the bull market, while the current bull cycle is only in the beginning stages. In this case, there is more demand, which would mean there is more of a cushion to mitigate a price crash.</p>

<title>Shiba Inu Price Soars 10% In Reaction To Explosive 2,367% SHIB Burn Surge</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />Shiba Inu（SHIB）是一种以太坊网络上的加密货币，最近经历了大幅上涨，吸引了全球加密货币爱好者的兴趣。这次价格上涨的原因有多方面，包括市场情绪的增长、社交媒体的影响、名人和意见领袖的背书等。Shibburn的数据显示，Shiba Inu的销毁率在过去24小时激增，社区的销毁活动和加密货币的供需动态引发了对SHIB的看涨情绪。此外，SHIB的价格也出现了显著上涨，交易量增加，并且有望突破关键价格点，恢复并超越前期最高点。 <div>
<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB), a prominent Ethereum-based cryptocurrency, witnessed a substantial rally, bolstering the interest of crypto enthusiasts worldwide. The nearly 10% surge in price on Monday has been attributed to a wave of market optimism, coinciding with a significant burn surge revealed by Shibburn, the meme coin&#8217;s burn tracker.</p>
<p>The recent rally of meme coins can be attributed to various factors. Firstly, the growing market sentiment and excitement surrounding meme coins have attracted investors seeking high-risk, high-reward opportunities.</p>
<p>Additionally, the influence of social media platforms, viral marketing, and endorsements from celebrities and influencers have played a significant role in driving up the prices of meme coins.</p>

<h2><strong>Shiba Inu Burn Surge Analysis</strong></h2>
<p>According to Shibburn&#8217;s data, the burn rate for Shiba Inu skyrocketed by a <a href="https://www.shibburn.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">staggering 2,367%</a> over the past 24 hours, resulting in the destruction of a whopping 186 million coins.</p>
<p>This surge in burning activity has further heightened market optimism surrounding the meme token, as the Shiba crypto community continues to make remarkable efforts to enhance the SHIB tokenomics.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-598478" height="334" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Shibburn.png?resize=381%2C334" width="381" /></p>

<p>The continuous depletion of SHIB&#8217;s supply through burning activities has triggered discussions about the dynamics of supply and demand, igniting a hurricane of bullish sentiments for Shiba Inu. Notably, it is the community&#8217;s concerted efforts, including significant transfers to a dead wallet, that have primarily contributed to the rise in the burn rate.</p>
<p>Shibburn&#8217;s insights shed light on two massive transactions by the Shiba crypto community, both involving transfers to a dead wallet. The first transaction saw a transfer of 168 million coins, while the second involved the transfer of 16.68 million SHIB.</p>
<p>These actions reflect the community&#8217;s determination to bolster the tokenomics of <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Shiba Inu</a> and have further contributed to the burn surge witnessed recently.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/uVSbXZKK/" width="1835" /></p>

<h2><strong>SHIB Price Climbs Amid Optimism</strong></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">positive momentum</a> extends beyond burning activity, as Shiba Inu&#8217;s price experienced a substantial uptick of 10% over the past 24 hours, reaching a current trading value of $0.0000287.</p>
<p>This surge in price has been accompanied by a surge in trading volume by nearly 23% and a market cap increase of 10%, firmly establishing a<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/shiba-inu" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> bullish stance for SHIB.</a> However, it is important to note that the recent correction in Bitcoin&#8217;s price led to a temporary dip for Shiba Inu, which reached a low of $0.0000238.</p>

<p>With the recent upward movement, there is growing optimism that SHIB may breach the $0.00003 mark, potentially paving the way for a recovery trend that could push prices above the previous swing high of $0.000045 and even surpass the $0.00005 milestone.</p>
<p>Market observers are particularly encouraged by the burning chronicles of the meme coin, which further contribute to the prevailing market optimism.</p>

<br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />最近比特币恐惧与贪婪指数显示情绪有所降温，为可能的反弹铺平了道路。指数考虑波动性、交易量、社交媒体情绪、市值主导和谷歌趋势。当前，投资者持有极度贪婪的心态，但指数现在为77，显示情绪有所减缓。先前最高点与极端贪婪情绪重合，而最低点通常发生在市场处于极度恐惧区域时。比特币价格周末暴跌至64,500美元，但在过去一天中已经有所恢复，目前回升至68,000美元。 <div>
<p>The Bitcoin Fear &amp; Greed Index shows that the sentiment around the asset has cooled off a bit recently, something that could pave the way for a rebound.</p>

<p>The &#8220;<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/crypto-fear-greed-index-drops-to-one-month-low-heres-what-it-means/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Fear &amp; Greed Index</a>&#8221; is an indicator created by <a href="https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Alternative</a> that tells us about the average sentiment present among the investors in the Bitcoin and wider cryptocurrency market</p>
<p>To determine the trader mentality, the index takes into consideration for these five factors: volatility, trading volume, social media sentiment, market cap dominance, and Google Trends.</p>

<p>The metric uses a numeric scale that runs from zero to hundred for representing this sentiment. A score of 46 or less implies the presence of fear among the investors, while that of 54 and above suggests greed in the market.</p>
<p>The territory between these two (47 to 53) naturally corresponds to the neutral mentality. Besides these three sentiments, there are also two extreme sentiments called &#8220;extreme greed&#8221; and &#8220;extreme fear.&#8221;</p>
<p>The extreme greed occurs at values above 75, while the extreme fear takes place below 25. Historically, these two sentiments have been quite relevant for BTC&#8217;s trajectory.</p>
<p>Tops have generally tended to form when the investors have held the former sentiment, while bottoms have been probable to happen when the market has been in the latter region.</p>
<p>At present, the traders are holding a mentality of extreme greed, as the latest data of the Bitcoin Fear &amp; Greed Index shows.</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Fear &amp; Greed Index" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-598440 aligncenter" height="329" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/meter_b48137.png?w=368&#038;resize=368%2C329" width="368" /></p>

<p>As is visible, the indicator&#8217;s value is 77 right now, meaning that while it&#8217;s indeed inside extreme greed, it&#8217;s only so just. This is a fresh change from how it has been recently, as the chart below displays.</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Extreme Greed" class="alignnone wp-image-598444 size-large aligncenter" height="406" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/chart_be381d.png?w=860&#038;resize=860%2C406" width="860" /></p>

<p>From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that the Bitcoin Fear &amp; Greed Index has mostly stayed deep inside the extreme greed region recently. On the 14th of this month, the indicator hit the 88 mark, and alongside this high, the BTC price registered its current all-time high of about $73,800.</p>
<p>Since this peak, though, the asset has <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-threatens-to-retreat-to-60000-as-bulls-seek-solid-ground/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">plunged</a>, and it appears that alongside it, so has the sentiment among the traders. As mentioned earlier, tops have been more likely to occur when the market has shared a mentality of extreme greed and this probability has generally only gone up the more extreme levels the metric has hit.</p>
<p>This could perhaps explain why the recent top occurred when it did. Another top this month, the one that took place on the 5th, also coincided with high values in the Fear &amp; Greed Index (a peak of 90 this time).</p>

<p>Shortly after this earlier peak and the plummet in the cryptocurrency that had followed, the asset found its bottom as the metric briefly exited the extreme greed region.</p>
<p>As the Bitcoin Fear &amp; Greed Index is once again looking to dip outside this territory, it&#8217;s possible that a bottom may be near for the price this time as well. It now remains to be seen if the sentiment would cool down enough in the coming days so as to leave the extreme region behind, at least temporarily.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>Bitcoin had plunged towards $64,500 during the weekend, but it seems the coin has made some recovery in the past day as it&#8217;s now back at $68,000.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Approaches Risky Territory As Halving Event Draws Near</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。文章讨论了比特币价格下跌的趋势，并预测在即将到来的分叉事件之前可能会进一步下降。专家指出在历史上，比特币在距离分叉事件前14-28天经常出现大幅回撤。此外，文章还介绍了比特币分叉的4个不同阶段，包括分叉前的上涨、最终分叉前的回撤、重新积累和抛物线上涨。文章强调了在暴涨之前通常会有一个多月的重新积累阶段。 <div>
<p>The <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-hits-support-65k/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">price of Bitcoin</a> has been on a downward trend since it reached a new all-time of $73,000, ushering in a wave of speculations regarding the crypto asset&#8217;s next direction in the short term.</p>
<p>In the past few days, Bitcoin&#8217;s recent dip has triggered a general crypto market retracement. With the Bitcoin Halving event fast approaching, many crypto analysts are anticipating a further decline in BTC&#8217;s price in the near future.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Poised For &#8220;Danger Zone&#8221; Ahead Of Halving Event</h2>
<p>Popular cryptocurrency trader and analyst Rekt Capital has <a href="https://x.com/rektcapital/status/1769465412322766993?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">shared</a> a gloomy prediction for Bitcoin with the crypto community on the social media platform X. His forecast examines BTC&#8217;s potential to drop even further prior to the halving event while noting the entrance to a risky area he dubbed the &#8220;Danger Zone.&#8221;</p>

<p>The analyst&#8217;s forecast came in light of BTC experiencing a notable decline in the past few days. According to the expert, two days from now, Bitcoin will formally venture into the danger Zone (orange). </p>
<p>This is the starting area of past retracements seen ahead of the BTC Halving, which is expected to take place in April. Prior to the halving, these retracements have constantly indicated intervals of substantial market corrections for the digital asset. </p>
<img alt="Bitcoin" class="size-medium wp-image-598467" height="325" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Rekt-Capital-Bitcoin-Chart-1.jpg?w=460&#038;resize=460%2C325" width="460" />
<p>Rekt Capital further pointed out that the pre-halving retracements have historically been observed in BTC 14-28 days before the event. Bitcoin&#8217;s price witnessed a pullback of about 40% in advance of the 2016 halving occurrence. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, in 2020, the crypto asset fell by over 40% before the occasion. Presently, we are less than 30 days before this year&#8217;s <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/grayscale-next-bitcoin-halving-different/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">BTC halving</a> takes place; however, the price of the coin has declined by over 11% in the past week, suggesting further correction in the coming weeks. </p>
<p>The post read:</p>
<blockquote><p>In 2 days, Bitcoin will officially enter the &#8220;Danger Zone&#8221; (orange) where historical Pre-Halving Retraces have begun. Historically, Bitcoin has performed Pre-Halving Retraces 14-28 days before the Halving. In 2020, this retrace was -20% deep, and in 2016, this retrace was -40% deep. Currently, BTC is 30 days away from the Halving and has pulled back -11% this week.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is noteworthy that the crypto analyst had previously <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/historical-trends-unveil-bitcoin-peak-timing-in-current-bull-cycle/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">pinpointed</a> the timeframe BTC is expected to top out in this bull cycle. Rekt Capital believes the asset will peak within 280-350 days. Specifically, this could occur around mid-December this year, or in mid-February of next year.</p>
<h2>4 Distinct Halving Phases</h2>
<p>So far, the crypto analyst has <a href="https://x.com/rektcapital/status/1769656725341163692?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">highlighted</a> several different phases for the upcoming Bitcoin Halving; these include the Pre-Halving Rally, Final Pre-Halving Retrace, Re-accumulation, and Parabolic uptrend.</p>

<p>According to Rekt Capital, there usually is a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/whats-ahead-for-bitcoin-expert-forecasts-pre-halving-rally-as-early-as-next-week/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">pre-halving rally</a> approximately 60 days before the event takes place. For the final pre-halving retrace, it usually develops around 14 to 28 days ahead.</p>
<p>Furthermore, after the Pre-Halving pullback, a multi-month re-accumulation period follows. Lastly, the parabolic uptrend begins once Bitcoin exits the area of re-accumulation.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Threatens To Retreat To $60,000 As Bulls Seek Solid Ground</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。比特币价格在创纪录高点后出现剧烈价格回调，导致投资者担忧可能出现更多熊市迹象。分析人士指出，投资者情绪受到影响，地址活跃度下降，市场存在卖压。然而，一些技术分析显示60,000至67,000美元之间可能是买家的支撑区域。尽管眼下形势不明朗，一些分析师看好比特币的长期前景，认为当前回调是牛市的正常和健康部分。机构资本的可能回归也被认为是潜在的反弹催化剂。 <div>
<p>After a spectacular ascent to record highs, Bitcoin (BTC) is facing a reality check. The past week has seen a dramatic price correction, leaving investors wondering if this is a temporary setback or a sign of a more bearish future.</p>
<p>The world&#8217;s most popular cryptocurrency reached an<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> intraday low of $64,620</a> on March 17th, a significant drop from its recent peak above $73,000. This pullback has triggered a wave of pessimism, with analysts pointing to declining profitability and a drop in daily active addresses on the network.</p>

<h2><strong>A Bearish Shadow Looms</strong></h2>
<p>According to analysts, investor sentiment has been hurt by a series of descending peaks and failed upturns, while selling pressure remains rampant as we approach the &#8220;weekly candle close.&#8221; This sentiment is echoed by data from IntoTheBlock, which shows a sharp decline in the number of addresses &#8220;In the Money,&#8221; signifying a decrease in overall profitability within the Bitcoin network.</p>

<h2><strong>Finding Support: A Beacon of Hope?</strong></h2>
<p>However, not everyone is hitting the panic button. Technical analysis suggests a potential support zone for buyers between $60,000 and $67,000. Popular trader Skew highlights this area as a possible turning point, while also acknowledging significant spot selling from major exchanges like Coinbase and Binance.</p>

<strong>Bulls On The Horizon: Are The Giants Awakening?</strong>
<p>While the immediate future appears uncertain, some analysts remain bullish on Bitcoin&#8217;s long-term prospects. They view the current correction as a natural and healthy part of any bull run, pointing to historical data where similar pullbacks paved the way for further growth.</p>
<p>Related Reading: <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-crashes-dip-to-65000-triggers-over-400-million-liquidation-avalanche/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin Crashes: Dip To $65,000 Triggers Over $400 Million Liquidation Avalanche</a></p>
<p>Adding fuel to the fire of optimism is the potential return of institutional capital. The recent resumption of buying from US Bitcoin ETFs and the prospect of a significant influx of funds from hedge funds and investment advisors in the coming months are seen as potential catalysts for a rebound.</p>


<p>Thomas Fahrer, CEO of Apollo, a decentralized online cryptocurrency platform renowned for its comprehensive crypto reviews and analysis of ETF inflows, echoes sentiments regarding X.</p>
<p>Fahrer characterizes the current state as a &#8220;Bear Trap&#8221; and pinpoints the resumption of buying from US Bitcoin ETFs on March 18 as a potential catalyst for an upward surge in X&#8217;s value.</p>
<p>Related Reading: <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/forget-dogecoin-shiba-inu-set-to-become-the-top-dog-expert-predicts-100-billion-market-cap/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Forget Dogecoin, Shiba Inu Set To Become The Top Dog: Expert Predicts $100 Billion Market Cap</a></p>
<p>Emphasizing the significance of increased institutional acceptance, Fahrer anticipates a surge in liquidity within Bitcoin ETFs, suggesting that substantial capital inflows from institutional investors have yet to materialize.</p>
<strong>The Verdict: Brace For A Volatile Week</strong>
<p>This week will be crucial for Bitcoin. The coming days will be a test of the cryptocurrency&#8217;s resilience and its ability to overcome the current selling pressure. If bulls can regain control and positive sentiment prevails, a return to record highs remains a possibility. However, if the downtrend continues, Bitcoin could face a more extended period of correction.</p>

<title>Solana Market Cap Set To Skyrocket 1,000%, Says Crypto Fund CEO</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-market-cap-1000-crypto-fund-ceo/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-market-cap-1000-crypto-fund-ceo/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章指出了Asymmetric的CEO兼CIO Joe McCann对Solana市值达到1万亿美元的乐观预测。McCann认为Solana胜过以太坊，因为以太坊的L1交易慢且昂贵，L2解决方案复杂，不适合零售用户。他认为Solana成功吸引了零售用户，尤其是通过与memecoin和投机交易的联合。Solana上的memecoin数量和交易量大幅增加，成为其吸引力和实用性的证明。McCann还比较了以太坊和Solana的市值，并认为Solana有潜力实现近10倍增长。Solana目前的交易价格为201.27美元。 <div>
<p>Joe McCann, the CEO and CIO of the crypto hedge fund Asymmetric, recently made a bold <a href="https://twitter.com/joemccann/status/1769497076667404528" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">statement</a> on X (formerly Twitter), forecasting a $1 trillion market cap for Solana. McCann&#8217;s argument hinges on several key points that detail why he believes Solana has achieved product-market fit (PMF) as &#8220;The Chain for Retail,&#8221; juxtaposing it against Ethereum&#8217;s challenges and perceived shortcomings for retail users.</p>
<h2>Solana Beats Ethereum</h2>
<p>McCann critiques Ethereum for not being designed with retail in mind, pointing out its slow and expensive Layer 1 (L1) transactions, alongside the user experience (UX) nightmare posed by its numerous Layer 2 (L2) solutions. He states, &#8220;Ethereum is not a chain designed for retail &#8211; the L1 is too slow and expensive and the L2s are (currently) a UX nightmare.&#8221;</p>
<p>The friction for new users, fragmented liquidity across over “40 L2s”, and the complications with bridging are highlighted as significant barriers to Ethereum&#8217;s adoption by a broader retail audience.</p>

<p>Turning his attention to corporate-backed open-source projects like Coinbase&#8217;s L2 solution, Base, McCann acknowledges their potential to solve some <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-fees-plunge-70-following-a-yearly-high-in-may/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">UX issues</a>. However, he also notes the inherent priority of such projects to serve corporate interests, often at the expense of broader community needs.</p>
<p>Despite his critique, he admits, &#8220;Most corporate open source ultimately ends up serving corporate priorities&#8230;and it should!&#8221; This acknowledgment underscores the complexity of balancing corporate involvement in blockchain development with the ecosystem&#8217;s decentralized ethos.</p>
<p>McCann attributes Solana&#8217;s rise to its ability to serve the retail segment effectively, particularly through its association with memecoins and speculative trading. Describing Solana as originally being &#8220;Blockchain at Nasdaq speed&#8221; for its high throughput and low latency, he notes a pivotal shift in its narrative towards retail.</p>

<p>He observes, &#8220;Not once has the concept of being The Chain for Retail<img alt="™" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" style="height: 1em;" /> ever surfaced. Until now.&#8221; This shift is largely credited to Solana&#8217;s embrace by the memecoin community and the speculative trading that follows, marking a clear PMF with retail users.</p>
<p>Highlighting the explosion of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/why-shiba-inu-pepe-dogecoin-are-far-from-done/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">memecoin speculation</a> on Solana, especially post-NFL season, McCann points out, &#8220;Since the NFL season ended, speculation on memecoins has exploded&#8230;<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/sponsored/bonk-price-prediction-next-big-altcoin-set-to-explode/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">BONK</a> and WIF are on Solana. [&#8230;] Thousands of them are being created everyday and trading volumes are exploding.”</p>
<img alt="Meme coins go parabolic" class="wp-image-598412 size-full" height="766" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GI6BLhYaIAApe5v.jpg?resize=1314%2C766" width="1314" />
<p>The extensive creation and trading volumes of these coins on Solana are seen as a testament to its appeal and utility for retail speculators. Notably, the majority of memecoins is on Solana, not Ethereum.</p>
<p>”Trading Bots aka the ‘<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bonk-price-jumps-over-30-as-robinhood-revolut-listing-speculations-gain-traction/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Robinhood</a>-ification of crypto’ has been driving the majority of the trading due to its&#8230;great UX. [&#8230;] And the majority of those bots are trading memecoins on Solana. Solana is now consistently flipping Ethereum in DEX volumes yet for some reason, SOL is still 1/4th the value of Ethereum, it was 1/8th just a few days ago,” McCann noted.</p>
<img alt="Trading bots " class="wp-image-598411 size-full" height="830" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GI6B9VAbAAAJc57.jpg?resize=1488%2C830" width="1488" />
<p>He contrasts Solana&#8217;s market cap with Ethereum&#8217;s, using their relative valuations to argue for Solana&#8217;s growth potential. With Ethereum valued at just under $500 billion and Solana at about $115 billion, he suggests that Solana&#8217;s path to a $1 trillion market cap represents a nearly 10x growth opportunity, far outpacing the potential for Ethereum.</p>
<p>&#8220;ETH to $1T is a double. SOL to $1T is nearly a 10x. Which horse are you gonna bet on? The fastest one, obviously,&#8221; McCann concludes, encapsulating his bullish outlook for Solana based on its retail-friendly ecosystem and the vibrant activity around memecoins.</p>
<p>At press time, Solana traded at $201.27.</p>
<img alt="Solana price " class="wp-image-598413 size-full" height="1673" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/SOLUSD_2024-03-18_08-13-58.png?resize=3628%2C1673" width="3628" />

<title>SOL Price Crosses $200 Milestone, What’s Next For Solana?</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/sol-price-crosses-200/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/sol-price-crosses-200/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。Solana价格超过了$200关键阻力位，并显示出继续上涨的迹象。随着价格上涨，下一个重要的阻力位将是$205和$212。如果成功突破$212，可能会进一步上涨至$220水平。支撑位在$195和$175附近，以及在$165和$150水平。技术指标显示MACD朝着多头方向走高，RSI也位于50水平以上。 <div>
<p><em>Solana is gaining bullish momentum above $200. SOL price is still showing positive signs, and it could even surpass the $220 resistance in the near term.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>SOL price gained bullish momentum and cleared the $200 resistance against the US Dollar.</li>
<li>The price is now trading above $200 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).</li>
<li>There is a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $195 on the 4-hour chart of the SOL/USD pair (data source from Kraken).</li>
<li>The pair could continue to rally if it clears the $205 and $212 resistance levels.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Solana Price Extends Rally</h2>
<p>Solana price remained strong above the $150 level and extended its <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/sol-price-breaks-150/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">rally</a>. There was a decent increase above the $165 and $180 levels.</p>
<p>The price is up nearly 20% and there was a move above the $200 level, outperforming Bitcoin and <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-grinds-lower-3400/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ethereum</a>. A new multi-month high was formed near $204, and the price is now consolidating gains. It is stable above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $142 swing low to the $204 high.</p>
<p>There is also a connecting bullish trend line forming with support at $195 on the 4-hour chart of the SOL/USD pair. Solana is now trading above $200 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Solana_f3319d.png?resize=1024%2C461"><img alt="SOL Price" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-598388" height="461" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Solana_f3319d.png?resize=1024%2C461" width="1024" /></a></p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/SOLUSD/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SOLUSD on TradingView.com</a></p>
<p>Immediate resistance is near the $205 level. The next major resistance is near the $212 level. A successful close above the $212 resistance could set the pace for another major increase. The next key resistance is near $220. Any more gains might send the price toward the $232 level.</p>
<h2>Are Dips Supported in SOL?</h2>
<p>If SOL fails to rally above the $205 resistance, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $195 level and the trend line.</p>
<p>The first major support is near the $175 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $142 swing low to the $204 high, below which the price could test $165. If there is a close below the $165 support, the price could decline toward the $150 support or the 100 simple moving average (4 hours) in the near term.</p>
<p>Technical Indicators</p>
<p>4-Hours MACD – The MACD for SOL/USD is gaining pace in the bullish zone.</p>
<p>4-Hours RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for SOL/USD is above the 50 level.</p>
<p>Major Support Levels – $19, and $175.</p>
<p>Major Resistance Levels – $205, $212, and $220.</p>

</ul>
<h2>Ethereum Price Dips</h2>
<p>Ethereum price started a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-takes-hit-3680/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">downside correction</a> below the $3,800 and $3,700 levels, like <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-slides-68k/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin</a>. ETH declined below the $3,650 support level to enter a short-term bearish zone.</p>
<p>It even spiked below the $3,500 support zone. A low was formed at $3,414 and the price is now attempting a recovery wave. There was a move above the $3,500 level. Ether climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $4,084 swing high to the $3,414 low.</p>
<p>Ethereum price is now trading below $3,700 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $3,650 level. There is also a key bearish trend line forming with resistance at $3,660 on the hourly chart of ETH/USD.</p>
<p>The first major resistance is near the $3,750 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $4,084 swing high to the $3,414 low. The next major resistance is near $3,830, above which the price might gain bullish momentum.</p>

<p>In the stated case, Ether could rally toward the $3,925 level. If there is a move above the $3,925 resistance, Ethereum could even rise toward the $4,000 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of $4,080.</p>
<h2>More Losses In ETH?</h2>
<p>If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,650 resistance, it could start a fresh decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $3,520 level.</p>
<p>The first major support is near the $3,500 zone. The next key support could be the $3,420 zone. A clear move below the $3,420 support might send the price toward $3,350. Any more losses might send the price toward the $3,250 level.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的<br />MEMECOIN项目Book of Meme（BOME）在加密市场上迅速崭露头角，吸引了投资者的兴趣，并在48小时内达到了10亿美元的市值。Book of Meme由DarkFarms创立，旨在结合Meme、去中心化存储解决方案、degen shitcoin交易和赌博，为用户创造新颖的web3体验。BOME在Binance上市后价格急剧上涨243%，市值达到15.5亿美元。投资者从BOME的涨势中受益，有人在预售时以19,000美元的投资获得340倍收益。当前，BOME的价格为0.02139美元，市值为11.8亿美元，居于第85位的加密货币。 <div>
<p>Memecoin project Book of Meme (BOME) has emerged as the latest shining star in the crypto market over the last few days. Following its official launch this week, BOME has attracted much investor interest, acquiring a market cap of $1 billion within 48 hours of trading.</p>
<p>BOME’s sudden emergence can be regarded as a silver lining in the crypto space in the last week amidst Bitcoin’s 4% decline, which resulted in the maiden cryptocurrency falling to around $65,345.14. Meanwhile, Ethereum is also down by 10%, while prominent memecoins <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-influencer-scams/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Dogecoin</a> and <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/behind-the-scenes-of-shiba-inu-12-plunge-what-on-chain-analysis-tells-us/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Shiba Inu</a> also recorded losses to the tune of 24.23% and 16.69% over the last seven days. </p>

<h2>What Is The Book Of Meme?</h2>
<p>The Book of Meme was founded by DarkFarms, the creator of another popular memecoin Pepecoin. BOME functions as an experimental project aimed at incorporating memes, decentralized storage solutions, degen shitcoin trading, and gambling on a single platform in a bid to create a novel web3 experience. </p>
<p>Following a successful presale that raised 10,131 SOL, BOME debuted in the crypto market on March 14 with an initial price of $0.0000496. Over the next two days, Book of Meme swiftly rose to a price region of $0.012 while achieving a market cap value of $1 billion. </p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Due to the sudden listing by Binance, MEMECOIN BOME rose sharply by 243% in 24h, but other MEMECOINs generally fell sharply, PEPE WIF FLOKI BONK fell by more than 10%. The current market value of BOME has exceeded US$1.38 billion, ranking seventh in MEMECOIN in terms of market…</p>
<p>— Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1769015001304781183?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">March 16, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Unsurprisingly, BOME&#8217;s expeditious rise has earned the coin listings on major crypto platforms, including KuCoin, Gate.io, MEXC, HTX, Crypto.com and Binance. In particular, BOME’s listing on Binance on March 16 is believed to have spurred the token to a 243% price gain within a day, allowing the memecoin to gain a peak market cap of $1.55 billion. </p>
<p>In a similar fashion with other highly successful memecoins, some investors have benefitted the most from BOME’s rise.<a href="https://x.com/WuBlockchain/status/1769031149643501757?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> Data from LookonChain</a> reveals that a certain investor already sold all 347 million BOME for 34,647 SOL valued at $6.58 million, recording a 340x gain on 102 ($19,000) investment at the presale. Meanwhile, the largest BOME holding personal address known as sundayfunday.sol currently holds 1.242 billion BOME, valued at $29.8 million. </p>

<h2>BOME Price Overview</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, Book of Meme currently trades at $0.02139 with a 58.08% gain on the last day. Meanwhile, the coin’s daily trading volume is up by 125.05% and is valued at $5.18 billion. BOME’s current market cap stands at $1.18 billion, allowing the memecoin to rank as the 85th largest cryptocurrency. </p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。Shiba Inu目标是达到1000亿美元市值，吸引了加密社区的注意。数据显示持有SHIB代币的地址数量激增，表明零售投资者对Shiba Inu的兴趣和采纳度在增加。大型交易数量也增加，显示机构投资者和鲸鱼积极参与。拥有50%总供应量的前100个地址表明拥有大金额SHIB的持有人对市场有潜在影响。尽管交易活动波动性较大，但Jake Gagain预测Shiba Inu有望超过Dogecoin，并达到1000亿美元市值。 <div>
<p>Shiba Inu, the meme coin sensation, is making headlines once again. With its sights set on a major achievement &#8211; a staggering $100 billion market cap &#8211; Shiba Inu has captured the attention of the crypto community.</p>
<p>This audacious ambition has been fueled by data from IntoTheBlock, shedding light on the coin&#8217;s potential. Additionally, renowned investor Jake Gagain has made a bold prediction, further igniting excitement within the crypto community.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SHIB&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">$SHIB</a> Will Be The First 100 Billion MC Memecoin. <a href="https://t.co/YogeSb2E7q" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/YogeSb2E7q</a></p>
<p>— JAKE (@JakeGagain) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeGagain/status/1768722585221566612?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">March 15, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<h2><strong>Shiba Inu: Growing Interest, Volatile Trading</strong></h2>
<p>According to analysis from IntoTheBlock, SHIB has witnessed a surge in the number of addresses holding the token. This surge indicates a growing interest and adoption of Shiba Inu among retail investors, who are eager to partake in the meme coin revolution.</p>
<p>Moreover, there has been a notable increase in the number of large transactions involving Shiba Inu tokens, suggesting institutional investors and whales are actively engaging with the coin.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-598265" height="216" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_b80e2e.png?resize=388%2C216" width="388" /></p>

<p><a href="https://app.intotheblock.com/register" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">IntoTheBlock&#8217;s data</a> reveals a concentration of wealth among the top holders of Shiba Inu. Approximately 50% of the total supply is held by the top 100 addresses, indicating the potential influence these large holders may have on the market dynamics and price movements of Shiba Inu. This concentration of wealth can play a significant role in shaping the future trajectory of the coin.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/0YSrdCdD/" width="1835" /></p>

<p>Trading activity surrounding the memecoin has also been a focal point of the analysis. The data highlights the volatility of Shiba Inu&#8217;s trading volume, with periods of intense fluctuations followed by relative stability. This volatility can be attributed to various factors, including market sentiment, news events, and overall market conditions.</p>
<h2><strong>SHIB $100 Billion Milestone</strong></h2>
<p>In the midst of this excitement, renowned investor Jake Gagain has made a bold prediction: He firmly believes that Shiba Inu has the potential to surpass Dogecoin and reach a remarkable $100 billion market cap. This prediction has sparked both enthusiasm and skepticism, as the rivalry between Shiba Inu and Dogecoin intensifies.</p>

<p>Taking all these factors into account, the journey towards the billion-dollar market cap for <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/shiba-inu-mania-price-surges-60-as-burn-rate-heats-up-by-over-22000/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Shiba Inu</a> is not without its challenges. While the recent surge in market cap and the accumulation by large holders are positive indicators, the volatility and concentration of wealth present potential risks that need to be navigated.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the resilience and determination exhibited by the memecoin, coupled with the growing interest from retail and institutional investors, provide a strong foundation for its pursuit of the $100 billion milestone.</p>
<p>Shiba Inu&#8217;s quest for a $100 billion market cap represents a paradigm shift in the world of meme coins. Backed by data from IntoTheBlock, which highlights growing adoption, concentration of wealth, and trading activity, as well as the bold prediction from Jake Gagain, SHIB has positioned itself as a formidable contender in the cryptoverse.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。<br />马提克（MATIC）价格出现显著下跌，过去一周下跌超过10%，不到24小时下跌8%。数据显示大约10,900个地址在价位区间$1.02至$1.05购买了6.08亿MATIC，为该区间建立了关键支撑。如果这支撑破裂，下一个重要需求区域位于约$0.91。马提克当前价格为$1.04，市值超过97亿美元，排名第18。 <div>
<p><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/polygon/polygon-matic-whale-deposit-binance-bearish/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">MATIC, the native token of the Polygon network</a>, has witnessed a significant decline in its value. It has fallen by more than 10% in the past week and 8% in less than 24 hours as the general cryptocurrency market continues to grapple with a cloud of negative sentiment.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the latest on-chain analysis has revealed the important levels that investors should look out for following the latest decline in the MATIC price.</p>
<h2>Over 10,900 Addresses Bought 600 Million Polygon Tokens At This Price</h2>
<p>According to a recent <a href="https://x.com/ali_charts/status/1769135468208119809?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post on X</a> by crypto pundit Ali Martinez, the price of MATIC has established a key support around its current price point. This evaluation is based on analytics firm IntoTheBlock’s on-chain data, which tracks the average acquisition price for any given wallet address.</p>
<p><img alt="MATIC" class="aligncenter wp-image-598220 size-large" height="292" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GI06oELX0AA8aSo-1.jpeg?w=860&#038;resize=860%2C292" width="860" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Above is the chart highlighted by <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-long-positions-surge-on-bitfinex-whales-add-4230-btc-signaling-potential-price-reversal/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Martinez</a> that shows the distribution of the Polygon token supply across various price ranges. The size of the dots in the chart represents the magnitude of coins purchased around the corresponding price range.</p>

<p>Most notably, over 10,900 wallet addresses bought a whopping 608 million MATIC around the $1.02 and $1.05 zone. According to the crypto analyst, this massive buying activity has supported the establishment of crucial support around this price region.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Polygon?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">#Polygon</a> has found crucial support between $1.02 and $1.05, supported by 10,900 addresses holding around 608 million <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MATIC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">#MATIC</a>. Should this support falter, the next essential demand zone lies near $0.91, where 35,700 addresses collectively hold 394.6 million <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MATIC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">$MATIC</a>. <a href="https://t.co/rLn4ymcQf7" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/rLn4ymcQf7</a></p>

<p>While the large size of the dot reflects the strength of this particular level, sustained bearish pressure could cause the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/altcoins-watchlist-market-expert-spotlights-eth-blur-matic-and-more-for-explosive-gains/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">price of MATIC to breach</a> and fall beneath this support. In this case, investors could see the cryptocurrency drop to around $0.91.</p>
<p>This makes the $0.89 and $0.92 price range another level to watch, as it represents the next vital support area, where 35,680 wallet addresses purchased nearly 400 million Polygon tokens.</p>
<h2>MATIC Price Overview</h2>
<p>As of this writing, the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/matic/polygon-vesting-matic-price-3/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">price of MATIC</a> stands at $1.04, reflecting an 8% decline in the past 24 hours. This price dip comes after the altcoin printed a multi-month high of $1.28 on Thursday, March 14.</p>
<p>According to data from CoinGecko, the Polygon coin has suffered a 9.7% price slump in the last seven days. From a broader perspective, though, the cryptocurrency has had a fairly positive performance in the past month.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">With a market capitalization of more than $9.7 billion, the MATIC token ranks as the 18th-largest cryptocurrency in the sector.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Crashes: Dip To $65,000 Triggers Over $400 Million Liquidation Avalanche</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。比特币价格急剧下跌，导致市场动荡。在过去一周内，比特币价格下跌至65,000美元，其他加密货币也受到影响。市场分析师警告进一步下行风险，市场情绪不佳。总市场清算额超过4.26亿美元，长线交易者损失最严重。市场投资者开始重新评估策略。 <div>
<p>In a tumultuous turn of events, the cryptocurrency market has been rattled by a sharp decline in Bitcoin prices. After a sustained period of remarkable gains and record highs, Bitcoin has plunged to a weekly low of $65,000, marking a significant setback for investors.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bitcoin numbers were all painted in red,</a> and trading at $65,710, losing value in the 24-hour and weekly timeframes by 5.6% and 4.5%, respectively, according to data from Coingecko.</p>
<p>A few days after its previous low of $68,000, Bitcoin plummeted to its present level, a figure not seen in a week, as bears persisted in their downward pressure.</p>



<h2><strong>Altcoins Also Take A Beating</strong></h2>
<p>While Bitcoin bears the brunt of the downturn, altcoins are not spared from the fallout. Ethereum (ETH) and Binance Coin (BNB) have also witnessed<a href="https://coinank.com/liqMapChart" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> substantial losses</a>, shedding 10% of their value or more.</p>
<p>Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, two popular meme coins, have experienced even steeper declines, plunging by 20% and nearly 30%, respectively. The broader altcoin market mirrors Bitcoin&#8217;s downward trajectory, amplifying the sense of unease among investors.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/ISYm1HEA/" width="2475" /></p>

<strong>Bitcoin: Impact On Market Dynamics</strong>
<p>The recent price correction in Bitcoin has reverberated across the cryptocurrency landscape, reshaping market dynamics and investor sentiment. <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">The surge in liquidations</a>, with over 151,000 traders facing margin calls in the past 24 hours, underscores the magnitude of the market upheaval. Bitcoin&#8217;s dominance in the market is evident as it accounts for the lion&#8217;s share of the total liquidations, highlighting its pivotal role in shaping overall market trends.</p>
<p>As a result of the decline in value, the total market liquidations have reached $426 million, with Bitcoin taking the worst hit.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-598210" height="384" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_562718.png?resize=724%2C384" width="724" /></p>
<strong>Liquidation Spree</strong>
<p>The amount that the price of Bitcoin has liquidated over the last 24 hours has exceeded $104 million, with long traders losing the most money—they lost $86 million compared to $18 million for short sellers. Ethereum saw a $48 million overall liquidation, with $33 million going to long traders and $15 million going to short traders, as a result of the losing run.</p>
<strong>Analyst Sounds Alarm Siren</strong>
<p>Meanwhile, market analysts such as Markus Thielen, CEO of 10x Research, have sounded the alarm bells, warning of further downside risks for Bitcoin.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。文章提到，Grayscale已向美国证券交易委员会更新了以太坊现货ETF的申请，但随着最近的提醒，SEC批准以太坊现货ETF的成功几率降至35%。两位民主党参议员强烈敦促SEC主席不要批准加密投资产品，并限制未来加密ETF申请。他们指出，这些产品可能给零售投资者带来巨大风险。当前以太坊代币价格为$3,731，过去一天上涨了1.2%。 <div>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-spot-etf-grayscale-outflows/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Asset management firm Grayscale</a> Investments has updated its application for an Ethereum spot ETF (exchange-traded fund) with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<h2 class="p1"><strong>Ethereum Spot ETF Case Just As Solid As Bitcoin’s, Grayscale Argues</strong></h2>
<p class="p1">According to a recent post on X by Craig Salm, Grayscale’s chief legal officer, the asset management firm has <a href="https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/nyse/markets/nyse-arca/rule-filings/filings/2024/SR-NYSEArca-2023-70_Am._1.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">revised its 19b-4 form</a> for an Ether spot ETF. Salm claimed that this move was “important” in an effort for Grayscale to list and trade shares of its Ether Trust on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Arca.</p>
<p class="p1">The chief legal officer <a href="https://x.com/CraigSalm/status/1768750794021511218?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">stated in his post</a> that investors “want and deserve access” to Ethereum via a spot exchange-traded product, likening the situation to the Bitcoin ETF story. “We believe the case is just as strong as it was for spot Bitcoin ETFs,” Salm said.</p>

<p class="p1">The asset manager is amongst the numerous firms <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/approval-denial-ethereum-etf-sell-the-news-event/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">looking to issue the first Ethereum spot ETF</a> in the United States, having filed an application with the SEC on October 10, 2023. However, these ETF applications have faced delays multiple times, with the most recent coming against BlackRock’s filing on March 4, 2024.</p>
<p class="p1">As a result, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-etfs-approval-odds-drop-to-35/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the likelihood</a> of the SEC approving an Ethereum spot ETF has taken a nosedive in recent weeks. Once-optimistic Bloomberg ETF expert Balchunas even revealed in his latest analysis that the ETH funds now have only a 35% chance of approval.</p>












<h2><strong>SEC Chairman Faces Pressure Over Crypto Approval</strong></h2>













<p class="p1">Two US senators of the Democrat party, Sens. Laphonza Butler of California and Jack Reed of Rhode Island, have urged the SEC chairman to avoid approving crypto investment products. In a letter dated March 11, the lawmakers, who are also members of the Senate Banking Committee, asked the Commission to limit future crypto ETF applications.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The success of the BTC spot products clearly ruffling some feathers on the Hill. <a href="https://twitter.com/SenatorJackReed?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">@SenatorJackReed</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Senlaphonza?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">@Senlaphonza</a> write to the <a href="https://twitter.com/SECGov?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">@SECGov</a> urging:-no further ETPs for other tokens-make life difficult (i.e. examinations/reviews) for brokers and advisers that recommend BTC ETPs <a href="https://t.co/enxdumC02N" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/enxdumC02N</a></p>

<p></p>
<p class="p1">Following the approval of 11 Bitcoin spot ETFs in January, the attention of the crypto public has somewhat turned to whether the SEC will do the same for the Ethereum versions. However, this latest letter from the senate seems to further <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-etfs-approval-outlook-fades-ahead-may-23/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">hurt the chances of an ETH ETF approval</a>.</p>

<p class="p1">A part of the letter read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">Retail investors would face enormous risks from ETPs referencing thinly traded cryptocurrencies or cryptocurrencies whose prices are especially susceptible to pump-and-dump or other fraudulent schemes,&#8221; they said. &#8220;The Commission is under no obligation to approve such products, and given the risk, it should not do so.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">As of this writing, the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-takes-hit-3680/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">price of the Ethereum</a> token stands at $3,731, reflecting a 1.2% increase in the past day.</p>
