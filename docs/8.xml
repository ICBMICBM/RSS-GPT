<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br><br>摘要：<br>这些信息是积极的。比特币价格在$65,000支撑区域得到测试，并正在尝试突破$70,000的阻力区域。价格从$64,555的低点开始上涨，并突破了$66,500和$67,100的阻力区域。如果价格能够突破$70,000的阻力区域，可能会进一步上涨至$71,200。然而，如果价格无法突破$70,000，并出现下跌，则可能回落至$65,000和$64,500的支撑区域。技术指标显示MACD正在失去动力，而RSI已经超过50水平。 <div>
<p><em>Bitcoin price tested the $65,000 support zone. BTC is now rising and attempting a fresh increase above the $70,000 resistance zone in the near term.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Bitcoin price is showing a few positive signs from the $65,000 zone.</li>
<li>The price is trading below $70,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average.</li>
<li>There was a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance at $67,100 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair (data feed from Kraken).</li>
<li>The pair could gain bullish momentum if it clears the $70,000 resistance zone in the near term.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Bitcoin Price Holds Support</h2>
<p>Bitcoin price started a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-slides-68k/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">downside correction</a> from the $73,500 zone. There was a steady decline below the $70,000 support zone and the bears pushed the price below $68,000.</p>
<p>Finally, the price tested the $65,000 support zone. A low was formed at $64,555 and the price is now attempting a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-surge-toward-75k/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">fresh increase</a>. There was a move above the $66,500 resistance zone. The price climbed above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $73,734 swing high to the $64,555 low.</p>
<p>There was also a break above a major bearish trend line with resistance at $67,100 on the hourly chart of the BTC/USD pair. Bitcoin is now trading below $70,000 and the 100 hourly Simple moving average.</p>
<p>Immediate resistance is near the $69,200 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $73,734 swing high to the $64,555 low. The next key resistance could be $70,000, above which the price could rise toward the $71,200 resistance zone.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bitcoin_c10f0a.png?resize=1024%2C461"><img alt="Bitcoin Price" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-598382" height="461" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Bitcoin_c10f0a.png?resize=1024%2C461" width="1024" /></a></p>
<p>Source: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/BTCUSD/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">BTCUSD on TradingView.com</a></p>
<p>If there is a clear move above the $71,200 resistance zone, the price could even attempt a move above the $72,000 resistance zone. Any more gains might send the price toward the $73,500 level.</p>
<h2>More Losses In BTC?</h2>
<p>If Bitcoin fails to rise above the $70,000 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $67,000 level.</p>
<p>The first major support is $65,000. The main support sits at $64,500. If there is a close below $64,500, the price could start a drop toward the $63,500 level. Any more losses might send the price toward the $62,000 support zone.</p>
<p>Technical indicators:</p>
<p>Hourly MACD – The MACD is now losing pace in the bearish zone.</p>
<p>Hourly RSI (Relative Strength Index) – The RSI for BTC/USD is now above the 50 level.</p>
<p>Major Support Levels – $66,500, followed by $65,000.</p>
<p>Major Resistance Levels – $69,200, $70,000, and $71,200.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br><br>摘要：<br>这些信息是积极的。Book of Meme (BOME)是最近在加密市场上崭露头角的明星项目，刚刚推出后吸引了投资者的极大兴趣，在48小时内市值达到10亿美元。BOME由Pepecoin的创造者DarkFarms创建，旨在在一个平台上结合模因、去中心化存储解决方案、疯狂热门币交易和赌博。该项目迅速上升并登上Binance等主要加密平台。目前，BOME的价格为0.02139美元，日交易量增长了125.05%，市值达到11.8亿美元，排名第85位。 <div>
<p>Memecoin project Book of Meme (BOME) has emerged as the latest shining star in the crypto market over the last few days. Following its official launch this week, BOME has attracted much investor interest, acquiring a market cap of $1 billion within 48 hours of trading.</p>
<p>BOME’s sudden emergence can be regarded as a silver lining in the crypto space in the last week amidst Bitcoin’s 4% decline, which resulted in the maiden cryptocurrency falling to around $65,345.14. Meanwhile, Ethereum is also down by 10%, while prominent memecoins <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-influencer-scams/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Dogecoin</a> and <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/behind-the-scenes-of-shiba-inu-12-plunge-what-on-chain-analysis-tells-us/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Shiba Inu</a> also recorded losses to the tune of 24.23% and 16.69% over the last seven days. </p>

<h2>What Is The Book Of Meme?</h2>
<p>The Book of Meme was founded by DarkFarms, the creator of another popular memecoin Pepecoin. BOME functions as an experimental project aimed at incorporating memes, decentralized storage solutions, degen shitcoin trading, and gambling on a single platform in a bid to create a novel web3 experience. </p>
<p>Following a successful presale that raised 10,131 SOL, BOME debuted in the crypto market on March 14 with an initial price of $0.0000496. Over the next two days, Book of Meme swiftly rose to a price region of $0.012 while achieving a market cap value of $1 billion. </p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Due to the sudden listing by Binance, MEMECOIN BOME rose sharply by 243% in 24h, but other MEMECOINs generally fell sharply, PEPE WIF FLOKI BONK fell by more than 10%. The current market value of BOME has exceeded US$1.38 billion, ranking seventh in MEMECOIN in terms of market…</p>
<p>— Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1769015001304781183?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">March 16, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Unsurprisingly, BOME&#8217;s expeditious rise has earned the coin listings on major crypto platforms, including KuCoin, Gate.io, MEXC, HTX, Crypto.com and Binance. In particular, BOME’s listing on Binance on March 16 is believed to have spurred the token to a 243% price gain within a day, allowing the memecoin to gain a peak market cap of $1.55 billion. </p>
<p>In a similar fashion with other highly successful memecoins, some investors have benefitted the most from BOME’s rise.<a href="https://x.com/WuBlockchain/status/1769031149643501757?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> Data from LookonChain</a> reveals that a certain investor already sold all 347 million BOME for 34,647 SOL valued at $6.58 million, recording a 340x gain on 102 ($19,000) investment at the presale. Meanwhile, the largest BOME holding personal address known as sundayfunday.sol currently holds 1.242 billion BOME, valued at $29.8 million. </p>

<h2>BOME Price Overview</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, Book of Meme currently trades at $0.02139 with a 58.08% gain on the last day. Meanwhile, the coin’s daily trading volume is up by 125.05% and is valued at $5.18 billion. BOME’s current market cap stands at $1.18 billion, allowing the memecoin to rank as the 85th largest cryptocurrency. </p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br><br>摘要: 这些信息是积极的。Shiba Inu作为一个追求1000亿美元市值的梦幻币，吸引了加密货币社区的关注。通过IntoTheBlock的数据分析，显示Shiba Inu的持有地址数量激增，表明零售投资者对该梗币的兴趣日益增长。同时，大量涉及Shiba Inu代币的大额交易量也表明机构投资者和鲸鱼活跃地参与其中。50%的Shiba Inu总供应量由前100个地址持有，暗示这些大持有者可能对市场动态和价格走势产生影响。尽管市场波动性较大，但Jake Gagain的大胆预测认为Shiba Inu有能力超越Dogecoin，达到1000亿美元市值。这些迹象表明，Shiba Inu在追求1000亿美元市值的道路上有坚实基础。 <div>
<p>Shiba Inu, the meme coin sensation, is making headlines once again. With its sights set on a major achievement &#8211; a staggering $100 billion market cap &#8211; Shiba Inu has captured the attention of the crypto community.</p>
<p>This audacious ambition has been fueled by data from IntoTheBlock, shedding light on the coin&#8217;s potential. Additionally, renowned investor Jake Gagain has made a bold prediction, further igniting excitement within the crypto community.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SHIB&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">$SHIB</a> Will Be The First 100 Billion MC Memecoin. <a href="https://t.co/YogeSb2E7q" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/YogeSb2E7q</a></p>
<p>— JAKE (@JakeGagain) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeGagain/status/1768722585221566612?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">March 15, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<h2><strong>Shiba Inu: Growing Interest, Volatile Trading</strong></h2>
<p>According to analysis from IntoTheBlock, SHIB has witnessed a surge in the number of addresses holding the token. This surge indicates a growing interest and adoption of Shiba Inu among retail investors, who are eager to partake in the meme coin revolution.</p>
<p>Moreover, there has been a notable increase in the number of large transactions involving Shiba Inu tokens, suggesting institutional investors and whales are actively engaging with the coin.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-598265" height="216" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_b80e2e.png?resize=388%2C216" width="388" /></p>

<p><a href="https://app.intotheblock.com/register" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">IntoTheBlock&#8217;s data</a> reveals a concentration of wealth among the top holders of Shiba Inu. Approximately 50% of the total supply is held by the top 100 addresses, indicating the potential influence these large holders may have on the market dynamics and price movements of Shiba Inu. This concentration of wealth can play a significant role in shaping the future trajectory of the coin.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/0YSrdCdD/" width="1835" /></p>

<p>Trading activity surrounding the memecoin has also been a focal point of the analysis. The data highlights the volatility of Shiba Inu&#8217;s trading volume, with periods of intense fluctuations followed by relative stability. This volatility can be attributed to various factors, including market sentiment, news events, and overall market conditions.</p>
<h2><strong>SHIB $100 Billion Milestone</strong></h2>
<p>In the midst of this excitement, renowned investor Jake Gagain has made a bold prediction: He firmly believes that Shiba Inu has the potential to surpass Dogecoin and reach a remarkable $100 billion market cap. This prediction has sparked both enthusiasm and skepticism, as the rivalry between Shiba Inu and Dogecoin intensifies.</p>

<p>Taking all these factors into account, the journey towards the billion-dollar market cap for <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/shiba-inu-mania-price-surges-60-as-burn-rate-heats-up-by-over-22000/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Shiba Inu</a> is not without its challenges. While the recent surge in market cap and the accumulation by large holders are positive indicators, the volatility and concentration of wealth present potential risks that need to be navigated.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the resilience and determination exhibited by the memecoin, coupled with the growing interest from retail and institutional investors, provide a strong foundation for its pursuit of the $100 billion milestone.</p>
<p>Shiba Inu&#8217;s quest for a $100 billion market cap represents a paradigm shift in the world of meme coins. Backed by data from IntoTheBlock, which highlights growing adoption, concentration of wealth, and trading activity, as well as the bold prediction from Jake Gagain, SHIB has positioned itself as a formidable contender in the cryptoverse.</p>

<div> <br><br>摘要：这些信息是消极的。<br>马蒂克（MATIC）的价格在过去一周内和不到24小时内分别下跌了超过10%和8%，与整个加密货币市场的负面情绪相互影响。然而，最新的链上分析显示了重要的支撑水平，投资者应该密切关注。超过10,900个地址在$1.02和$1.05的区域购买了6.08亿枚MATIC，为该价格区域建立了关键支撑。此外，如果支撑失守，可能下探至$0.91支撑。$0.89和$0.92价位也是另一个重要的支撑区域，有35,680个地址购买了近4亿MATIC。当前MATTC的价格为$1.04，在过去24小时内下跌了8%，过去7天下跌了9.7%。持有超过97亿美元市值，MATIC在加密货币市场中排名第18。 <div>
<p><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/polygon/polygon-matic-whale-deposit-binance-bearish/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">MATIC, the native token of the Polygon network</a>, has witnessed a significant decline in its value. It has fallen by more than 10% in the past week and 8% in less than 24 hours as the general cryptocurrency market continues to grapple with a cloud of negative sentiment.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the latest on-chain analysis has revealed the important levels that investors should look out for following the latest decline in the MATIC price.</p>
<h2>Over 10,900 Addresses Bought 600 Million Polygon Tokens At This Price</h2>
<p>According to a recent <a href="https://x.com/ali_charts/status/1769135468208119809?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post on X</a> by crypto pundit Ali Martinez, the price of MATIC has established a key support around its current price point. This evaluation is based on analytics firm IntoTheBlock’s on-chain data, which tracks the average acquisition price for any given wallet address.</p>
<p><img alt="MATIC" class="aligncenter wp-image-598220 size-large" height="292" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GI06oELX0AA8aSo-1.jpeg?w=860&#038;resize=860%2C292" width="860" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Above is the chart highlighted by <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-long-positions-surge-on-bitfinex-whales-add-4230-btc-signaling-potential-price-reversal/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Martinez</a> that shows the distribution of the Polygon token supply across various price ranges. The size of the dots in the chart represents the magnitude of coins purchased around the corresponding price range.</p>

<p>Most notably, over 10,900 wallet addresses bought a whopping 608 million MATIC around the $1.02 and $1.05 zone. According to the crypto analyst, this massive buying activity has supported the establishment of crucial support around this price region.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Polygon?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">#Polygon</a> has found crucial support between $1.02 and $1.05, supported by 10,900 addresses holding around 608 million <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MATIC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">#MATIC</a>. Should this support falter, the next essential demand zone lies near $0.91, where 35,700 addresses collectively hold 394.6 million <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MATIC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">$MATIC</a>. <a href="https://t.co/rLn4ymcQf7" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/rLn4ymcQf7</a></p>

<p>While the large size of the dot reflects the strength of this particular level, sustained bearish pressure could cause the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/altcoins-watchlist-market-expert-spotlights-eth-blur-matic-and-more-for-explosive-gains/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">price of MATIC to breach</a> and fall beneath this support. In this case, investors could see the cryptocurrency drop to around $0.91.</p>
<p>This makes the $0.89 and $0.92 price range another level to watch, as it represents the next vital support area, where 35,680 wallet addresses purchased nearly 400 million Polygon tokens.</p>
<h2>MATIC Price Overview</h2>
<p>As of this writing, the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/matic/polygon-vesting-matic-price-3/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">price of MATIC</a> stands at $1.04, reflecting an 8% decline in the past 24 hours. This price dip comes after the altcoin printed a multi-month high of $1.28 on Thursday, March 14.</p>
<p>According to data from CoinGecko, the Polygon coin has suffered a 9.7% price slump in the last seven days. From a broader perspective, though, the cryptocurrency has had a fairly positive performance in the past month.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">With a market capitalization of more than $9.7 billion, the MATIC token ranks as the 18th-largest cryptocurrency in the sector.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br><br>摘要：这些信息是消极的。<br>在加密货币市场出现动荡的情况下，比特币价格出现急剧下跌，达到每周最低水平65000美元，导致投资者遭受重大损失。除了比特币外，以太坊和币安币等备受打击，市场整体下跌。比特币的市场份额明显高于其他加密货币，在最近的市场调整中受到最严重打击。总市场清算达到4.26亿美元，比特币单独造成1.04亿美元的清算。市场分析师发出警告，预测比特币可能进一步下跌至63000美元，敦促投资者在当前市场环境中保持谨慎。这些挑战引发了投资者对市场潜在风险的担忧，推动他们重新评估持仓并寻求稳定获利的策略。 <div>
<p>In a tumultuous turn of events, the cryptocurrency market has been rattled by a sharp decline in Bitcoin prices. After a sustained period of remarkable gains and record highs, Bitcoin has plunged to a weekly low of $65,000, marking a significant setback for investors.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bitcoin numbers were all painted in red,</a> and trading at $65,710, losing value in the 24-hour and weekly timeframes by 5.6% and 4.5%, respectively, according to data from Coingecko.</p>
<p>A few days after its previous low of $68,000, Bitcoin plummeted to its present level, a figure not seen in a week, as bears persisted in their downward pressure.</p>



<h2><strong>Altcoins Also Take A Beating</strong></h2>
<p>While Bitcoin bears the brunt of the downturn, altcoins are not spared from the fallout. Ethereum (ETH) and Binance Coin (BNB) have also witnessed<a href="https://coinank.com/liqMapChart" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> substantial losses</a>, shedding 10% of their value or more.</p>
<p>Dogecoin and Shiba Inu, two popular meme coins, have experienced even steeper declines, plunging by 20% and nearly 30%, respectively. The broader altcoin market mirrors Bitcoin&#8217;s downward trajectory, amplifying the sense of unease among investors.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/ISYm1HEA/" width="2475" /></p>

<strong>Bitcoin: Impact On Market Dynamics</strong>
<p>The recent price correction in Bitcoin has reverberated across the cryptocurrency landscape, reshaping market dynamics and investor sentiment. <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">The surge in liquidations</a>, with over 151,000 traders facing margin calls in the past 24 hours, underscores the magnitude of the market upheaval. Bitcoin&#8217;s dominance in the market is evident as it accounts for the lion&#8217;s share of the total liquidations, highlighting its pivotal role in shaping overall market trends.</p>
<p>As a result of the decline in value, the total market liquidations have reached $426 million, with Bitcoin taking the worst hit.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-598210" height="384" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_562718.png?resize=724%2C384" width="724" /></p>
<strong>Liquidation Spree</strong>
<p>The amount that the price of Bitcoin has liquidated over the last 24 hours has exceeded $104 million, with long traders losing the most money—they lost $86 million compared to $18 million for short sellers. Ethereum saw a $48 million overall liquidation, with $33 million going to long traders and $15 million going to short traders, as a result of the losing run.</p>
<strong>Analyst Sounds Alarm Siren</strong>
<p>Meanwhile, market analysts such as Markus Thielen, CEO of 10x Research, have sounded the alarm bells, warning of further downside risks for Bitcoin. Thielen&#8217;s prediction of a potential drop to $63,000 sends a sobering message to investors, urging caution and prudence in navigating the current market environment.</p>
<p>His insights shed light on underlying concerns about Bitcoin&#8217;s market structure, including low trading volumes and liquidity, which exacerbate the risk of sharp price corrections.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-598209" height="340" src="https://www.newsbtc.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_34d7be.png?resize=588%2C340" width="588" /></p>
<p>Amidst the market turbulence, investors are grappling with the implications of Thielen&#8217;s analysis and adjusting their strategies accordingly. The era of meme coin mania appears to be waning, prompting investors to reassess their positions and secure profits while they still can.</p>

<div> <br><br>摘要：这些信息是积极的。投资公司已向美国证券交易委员会（SEC）更新了申请，以推出以太坊现货ETF。Grayscale认为以太坊现货ETF的潜力与比特币相当，并已申请将其Ether Trust股票列入纽约证券交易所Arca交易。然而，由于某些参议员敦促SEC主席不要批准加密投资产品的请求，以太坊现货ETF的批准前景受到了影响。最新数据显示，以太坊价格为3731美元，日增长率为1.2%。 <div>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-spot-etf-grayscale-outflows/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Asset management firm Grayscale</a> Investments has updated its application for an Ethereum spot ETF (exchange-traded fund) with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<h2 class="p1"><strong>Ethereum Spot ETF Case Just As Solid As Bitcoin’s, Grayscale Argues</strong></h2>
<p class="p1">According to a recent post on X by Craig Salm, Grayscale’s chief legal officer, the asset management firm has <a href="https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/nyse/markets/nyse-arca/rule-filings/filings/2024/SR-NYSEArca-2023-70_Am._1.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">revised its 19b-4 form</a> for an Ether spot ETF. Salm claimed that this move was “important” in an effort for Grayscale to list and trade shares of its Ether Trust on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Arca.</p>
<p class="p1">The chief legal officer <a href="https://x.com/CraigSalm/status/1768750794021511218?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">stated in his post</a> that investors “want and deserve access” to Ethereum via a spot exchange-traded product, likening the situation to the Bitcoin ETF story. “We believe the case is just as strong as it was for spot Bitcoin ETFs,” Salm said.</p>

<p class="p1">The asset manager is amongst the numerous firms <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/approval-denial-ethereum-etf-sell-the-news-event/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">looking to issue the first Ethereum spot ETF</a> in the United States, having filed an application with the SEC on October 10, 2023. However, these ETF applications have faced delays multiple times, with the most recent coming against BlackRock’s filing on March 4, 2024.</p>
<p class="p1">As a result, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-etfs-approval-odds-drop-to-35/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">the likelihood</a> of the SEC approving an Ethereum spot ETF has taken a nosedive in recent weeks. Once-optimistic Bloomberg ETF expert Balchunas even revealed in his latest analysis that the ETH funds now have only a 35% chance of approval.</p>












<h2><strong>SEC Chairman Faces Pressure Over Crypto Approval</strong></h2>













<p class="p1">Two US senators of the Democrat party, Sens. Laphonza Butler of California and Jack Reed of Rhode Island, have urged the SEC chairman to avoid approving crypto investment products. In a letter dated March 11, the lawmakers, who are also members of the Senate Banking Committee, asked the Commission to limit future crypto ETF applications.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The success of the BTC spot products clearly ruffling some feathers on the Hill. <a href="https://twitter.com/SenatorJackReed?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">@SenatorJackReed</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Senlaphonza?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">@Senlaphonza</a> write to the <a href="https://twitter.com/SECGov?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">@SECGov</a> urging:-no further ETPs for other tokens-make life difficult (i.e. examinations/reviews) for brokers and advisers that recommend BTC ETPs <a href="https://t.co/enxdumC02N" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/enxdumC02N</a></p>

<p></p>
<p class="p1">Following the approval of 11 Bitcoin spot ETFs in January, the attention of the crypto public has somewhat turned to whether the SEC will do the same for the Ethereum versions. However, this latest letter from the senate seems to further <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-etfs-approval-outlook-fades-ahead-may-23/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">hurt the chances of an ETH ETF approval</a>.</p>

<p class="p1">A part of the letter read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="p1">Retail investors would face enormous risks from ETPs referencing thinly traded cryptocurrencies or cryptocurrencies whose prices are especially susceptible to pump-and-dump or other fraudulent schemes,&#8221; they said. &#8220;The Commission is under no obligation to approve such products, and given the risk, it should not do so.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="p1">As of this writing, the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-takes-hit-3680/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">price of the Ethereum</a> token stands at $3,731, reflecting a 1.2% increase in the past day.</p>

<title>XRP Records Massive 80% Surge In Trading Volume – Can Price Reach A New ATH?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br><br>摘要：<br>这些信息是积极的。文章指出尽管XRP在大部分时间表现不佳，但最近交易量有所增加。尽管XRP价格从周一0.74美元水平回调了13％，但近期交易量激增超过80％。虽然交易量激增，价格并未持续增长。XRP突破了6年来的对称三角形，并吸引了大量鲸鱼交易，使价格达到8个月来的最高点0.74美元。然而，价格短期内下跌至0.6美元。现在的XRP价格为0.6398美元，距离历史最高价还有83％的距离。市场分析显示XRP有望大幅上涨至3美元，并且目前关注的主要阻力水平为0.74美元和1.5美元。 XRP的非证券地位也有望为价格上涨提供支持。 <div>
<p>XRP continues to <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-break-bull-pattern/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">show strength</a> despite largely underperforming during the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/breaking-news-ticker/breaking-bitcoin-hits-new-all-time-high-surging-past-70000-for-the-first-time-in-history/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">ongoing bull market</a>. Interestingly, the crypto witnessed a surge in activity last week, with trading volume surging in tandem. Particularly, the trading volume saw an increase of over 80% recently. </p>
<p>However, the boost in activity and trading volume has not necessarily translated into continuous price growth, as XRP is currently on a 13% percent correction from the $0.74 price level on Monday.</p>

<h2><b>XRP Trading Volume Surges, But Will Price Follow?</b></h2>
<p>XRP witnessed a surge earlier in the week which saw it breaking out of a 6-year-long symmetrical triangle, prompting analysts to anticipate a continued price surge. </p>
<p>During this period, the crypto witnessed a surge in trading volume from whales in particular, with large bouts of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/94-million-xrp-exits-binance/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">XRP leaving crypto exchanges</a>.</p>
<p>This bullish sentiment allowed XRP to cross over $0.74 for the first time in eight months, albeit for a short moment. This surge in price was short-lived, as XRP fell as low as $0.6 in the days after.</p>
<p>However, a recent 80% surge in on-chain activity and trading volume has led to the price of XRP increasing by 4.45% in the past 24 hours and 2.2% in a seven-day timeframe. </p>
<p>Volume spikes of this magnitude often occur before a price rally, therefore, this massive spike in volume has the XRP community speculating that a strong price rally could be on the horizon.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/7pDB2vOg/" width="1835" /></p>

<h2><b>Current Price Action: Can XRP Reach A New All-Time High?</b></h2>
<p>At the time of writing, XRP is trading at $0.6398. The crypto&#8217;s journey to a new all-time high is definitely <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/xrp-on-the-brink-bullish-pattern-or-profit-taking-retreat/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">not going to be an easy one</a>, as it is now down by 83% from its current all-time high of $3.84. </p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-rocket-2300-to-14-6/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">current market dynamics</a> and various <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-to-skyrockets-to-1-33-amidst-april-rally-analysts/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">predictions from many crypto analysts</a> indicate that the crypto might go on a surge of great magnitude in the near future. </p>
<p>One of these is a prediction from <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/symmetrical-30000-xrp-price/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">analyst Jaydee</a>, who <a href="https://x.com/jaydee_757/status/1751468373756858664?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">noted </a>that XRP&#8217;s recent breakout from the six-year trendline mentioned earlier could lead to a surge to $3 from the current price level.</p>
<p>The major resistance level to watch is $0.74. XRP tested this level a few days ago but failed to close above it. If bullish momentum continues and volume stays strong, XRP could break through $0.74 decisively in the new week. If it does, the next resistance <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-prediction-rally-0-85/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">levels are at $0.82</a> and $1.5. </p>

<p>One of the few factors that could contribute to a strong price increase is <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-scores-win-endorsed-as-non-security-status/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">regulatory clarity</a> regarding XRP&#8217;s status, which could boost confidence from institutional investors. </p>
<p>Notably, XRP&#8217;s non-security status seems <a href="https://t.co/uJ0bDpKfJE" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">to be gaining ground</a>. The European Corporate Governance Institute (ECGI) recently published a <a href="https://www.ecgi.global/sites/default/files/working_papers/documents/corporategovernancemeetsdataandtechnology.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">research paper</a> acknowledging this non-security status.</p>

<title>Crypto Carnage: Over $800 Million Wiped Out In Market Plunge</title>

<div> <br><br>摘要：<br>这些信息是积极的。最近的市场暴跌给加密行业带来了震撼，数亿美元在几个小时内被抹去。比特币价格急剧回落至每周最低水平67,500美元，导致几乎20万交易者在过去24小时内被清算。尽管市场出现剧烈波动，分析师们对于这是否标志着更广泛的市场转变还是只是牛市的临时波动存在分歧。比特币的价格已经部分恢复，并且观察到了多个替代币的类似反弹，这表明投资者可能将此视为购买机会。这次调整可以被视为在强劲涨势之后对市场进行健康重置。虽然一些杠杆头寸遭受了损失，但投资者仍然在购买低点，表明他们对加密货币的长期潜力持续信心。这个周末的事件是加密市场内部持续挣扎的一个缩影。 <div>
<p>The recent market plunge has sent shockwaves through the crypto industry, resulting in hundreds of millions in dollars being wiped out in a matter of hours.</p>
<p>The price of<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> Bitcoin</a> has retreated violently to a weekly low of $67,500 after a few days of showing remarkable advances and setting new all-time highs.</p>
<p>The altcoins have experienced a significant decline as well, resulting in nearly 200,000 traders making liquidations during the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>The weekend brought a tremor to the cryptocurrency market, with a sudden price correction causing short-term panic and hundreds of millions in liquidated positions.</p>
<p>However, despite the wobble, analysts are divided on whether this signifies a broader market shift or a mere blip on the bullish radar.</p>
<h2><strong>Crypto Long Squeeze Triggers Liquidations</strong></h2>
<p>Over a 24-hour period ending Friday, March 15th, the global cryptocurrency market capitalization shed a cool 6%. This triggered a wave of automated liquidations, particularly for investors holding leveraged long positions – essentially large bets on rising prices.</p>

<p>According to Coinglass, a crypto data analysis platform,<a href="https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> over $800 million worth of long positions were liquidated</a> across the market. Bitcoin itself bore the brunt of the selling pressure, dipping as low as $67,000 – its lowest point in over a week.</p>

<p>The pain wasn&#8217;t evenly distributed. Over one third of the liquidations, a total of $660 million, came from long positions on Bitcoin.</p>
<h2><strong>Altcoin Bloodbath Follows Bitcoin&#8217;s Lead</strong></h2>
<p>The tremors weren&#8217;t confined to Bitcoin. The correction spilled over to the altcoin market, with popular tokens like Cardano, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and XRP all experiencing significant price drops.</p>
<p>This, in turn, triggered further liquidations for long positions held on these altcoins. XRP traders alone saw over $10 million liquidated, with nearly $11 million coming from long positions.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/Un3Ttg2O/" width="1835" /></p>

<strong>Crypto Market Fights Back: Buying The Dip</strong>
<p>Despite the week&#8217;s fright, the overall sentiment in the crypto market remains surprisingly bullish. This is primarily fueled by the swift buying activity observed at key support levels as prices dipped.</p>
<p>Bitcoin, the world&#8217;s most sought-after crypto asset, for example, has already staged a partial recovery, bouncing back to <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">a little over $69,000</a> at the time of writing.</p>
<p>Similar rebounds have been observed across several altcoins, suggesting that investors might be viewing this as a buying opportunity.</p>

<p>This correction can be seen as a healthy market reset after a strong rally, some analysts say. While some leveraged positions got burned, the fact that investors are stepping in to buy the dip indicates continued confidence in the long-term potential of cryptocurrencies.</p>
<strong>A Continued Balancing Act</strong>
<p>The weekend&#8217;s events serve as a microcosm of the ongoing struggle within the crypto market. On one hand, there&#8217;s a growing sense of institutional adoption and mainstream acceptance, fueling a bullish sentiment.</p>
<p>On the other, the inherent volatility of crypto assets continues to pose a challenge, with sudden price swings capable of inflicting significant losses on unsuspecting investors.</p>

<title>Analyst Expects Bitcoin Price Correction To Persist, Targets $57,000 Support</title>

<div> <br><br>摘要：<br>这些信息是消极的。最近比特币（BTC）价格出现大幅波动，分析师预测BTC可能会继续下跌至57,000美元，标志着当前的修正阶段可能仍未结束。BTC展示了有效的熊市背离，暗示其最近的涨势可能即将耗尽并产生主要的负面价格波动。分析师认为，BTC的价格可能在57,000美元至61,000美元区间内下跌，同时预测BTC可能在比特币减半之前达到最高价值。这种价格波动可能预示着比特币减半前夕的结束。目前，比特币价格为69,027美元，最近一小时上涨0.17%，过去一天上涨1.26%，每日交易量上涨1.20%，为69.58亿美元。 <div>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC) has drawn much attention in the last few weeks, with a stunning price surge leading to a new <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-whale-217-million-profit-btc-73000/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">all-time high of $73,750.</a> Largely defined as the pre-halving rally, BTC&#8217;s bolstering gains have been followed by <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-suffers-crash-to-65000/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">significant price correction,</a> with the crypto market leader trading as low as $65,630 on March 15. </p>
<p>While the cryptocurrency may have picked up some minor gains in the last 12 hours as it attempts a market recovery, popular analyst Michaël van de Poppe has released a disturbing prediction that indicates Bitcoin price correction may be far from over.

<h2>Bitcoin May Have Peaked Pre-Halving, Analyst Says</h2>
<p>In a<a href="https://x.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1768737010087231899?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> Friday post on X</a>, van de Poppe shared a market forecast that Bitcoin could fall as low as $57,000, thus prolonging its current correction phase. The analyst began by highlighting that BTC still retained a valid bearish divergence which occurs when the price of an asset forms higher highs while the corresponding indicator forms lower highs. It usually indicates that the driving force behind a certain trend is attenuated with a reversal now on the horizon.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">#Bitcoin</a> remains to have a valid bearish divergence.</p>
<p>This is confirmed by the lower timeframe, lower highs, and clear rejection at $70.5K.</p>
<p>For this correction, I&#8217;d be targeting $57-61K, and, likely, we&#8217;ll have peaked pre-halving.</p>
<p>Altcoin summer is on the horizon. <a href="https://t.co/bGmnHcVDnz" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/bGmnHcVDnz</a></p>
<p>— Michaël van de Poppe (@CryptoMichNL) <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1768737010087231899?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">March 15, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>In the case of Bitcoin, the bearish divergence indicates the coin’s recent rally may be exhausted and is now likely to produce major negative price movements. Van de Poppe stated this theory was confirmed by BTC’s latest rejection at the $70,000 zone during its attempted market rebound. </p>
<p>The prominent crypto analyst predicts Bitcoin to soon resume its price correction, falling to a price range of $57,000 to $61,000. If these speculations prove true, it could also indicate that in similar fashion, the BTC market may attain its highest value prior to the Bitcoin halving. </p>
<p>For context, the Bitcoin Halving is historically preceded by a price rally followed by a significant price retrace ranging from 20% to 40%. With the next Halving event set for April 2024, van de Poppe believes that further retracement by Bitcoin could stamp the end of the pre-halving rally.
</p>

<title>Sell Sign Ignites Speculation: Solana Fate Hangs In The Balance?</title>
<link>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/sell-sign-ignites-speculation-solana-fate-hangs-in-the-balance/</link>
<guid>https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/sell-sign-ignites-speculation-solana-fate-hangs-in-the-balance/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br><br>摘要：<br>这些信息是相互矛盾的。技术指标显示Solana可能面临价格回调，但市场情绪却显示出极度乐观。技术分析师指出Solana的日线图上出现了卖出信号，可能导致价格回撤至$127。然而，Solana目前却展现出强劲的涨势，价格在过去一个月内上涨近50%。市场情绪极度乐观，预测Solana在三月份可能上涨12%，平均价格达到$237。尽管技术指标显示为77%的积极看涨，但比特币市场的空仓和多仓清算表明未来仍存在波动。Solana在最近一天内经历了近800万美元的清算。 <div>
<p>Solana (SOL), the high-speed blockchain darling, has entered a tug-of-war between technical indicators flashing red and a market sentiment surging with exuberance. This paradox leaves investors wondering: is a price correction imminent, or is Solana poised for a major breakout?</p>

<h2><strong>Solana Faces Technical Headwinds</strong></h2>
<p>Technical analysts are raising red flags. Ali Martinez, a prominent analyst, identified a sell signal on Solana&#8217;s daily chart using the TD Sequential indicator. This indicator has a haunting history with SOL, preceding price drops of 17% to 28% in the past.</p>
<p>Based on this historical data, Martinez predicts a potential retracement, suggesting <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Solana</a> could dip as low as $127. This technical analysis injects a dose of realism into the market, reminding investors of the inherent volatility of cryptocurrencies.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The TD Sequential presents a sell signal on the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Solana?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">#Solana</a> daily chart!</p>
<p>Since December 2023, every time this indicator suggested selling, the price of <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SOL&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">$SOL</a> dropped by 17% to 28%. A similar outlook could see <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SOL?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">#SOL</a> retrace to $152 or even $127. <a href="https://t.co/3JbXdabK3v" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/3JbXdabK3v</a></p>
<p>— Ali (@ali_charts) <a href="https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1768213412947845581?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">March 14, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<h2><strong>Solana Defies Pressure With Bullish Momentum</strong></h2>
<p>However, dismissing Solana based solely on technicals would be a mistake. In a surprising turn of events, Solana is currently defying the sell signal. As of this writing, SOL is <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">trading at a robust $190</a>, boasting a significant 24-hour trading volume and a market capitalization exceeding $79 billion.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/Vh3swaOE/" width="1835" /></p>

<p>More importantly, the price has been on a tear, surging nearly 50% in the past month and a remarkable 24% in the last week. This bullish momentum throws a wrench into the technical analysis, highlighting the unpredictable nature of market sentiment in the crypto sphere.</p>
<strong>Solana: On Optimism And Caution</strong>
<p>Looking ahead, the battle between technical indicators and market sentiment is set to continue. Bullish forecasts paint a rosy picture. Changelly, a popular crypto exchange, predicts a 12% increase for SOL by mid-March.</p>

<p>This aligns with the overwhelmingly bullish market sentiment, with technical indicators showing a 77% positive outlook and the Fear &amp; Greed Index hovering at an &#8220;extreme greed&#8221; score of 81. Crypto experts are joining the chorus of optimism, projecting an average SOL price of $237 for March, with a potential return on investment exceeding 80%.</p>
<strong>Buckle Up For A Bumpy Ride</strong>
<p>Meanwhile, the bitcoin market saw total liquidations of more than $230 million in the last day. Of this, liquidations from long positions totaled around $148 million, while those from short positions totaling about $82 million. Of them, Solana (SOL) had to deal with liquidations of close to $8 million in the same period.</p>
