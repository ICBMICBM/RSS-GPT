<div> <br><br>摘要：<br>这些信息是积极的。文章总结了Links NYC 2024第二天的主要讨论内容，涵盖了金融、加密货币和公共部门领域的领袖们分享的见解。讨论涉及与区块链交叉的最新创新，打击与加密货币相关的犯罪的策略，以及合规性如何成为行业新发展的重要推动者。文章还探讨了稳定币在金融领域中的重要性，人工智能如何增强加密货币生态系统，以及全球各地加密市场的合规性工作的重要性和挑战。 <div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the second day of Links NYC 2024, world-class leaders from finance, crypto, and the public sector convened to share behind-the-scenes insights and how they’re looking towards the future. Discussions covered a range of topics, including the latest innovations intersecting with blockchain, strategies to combat crypto-related crime, and how compliance is becoming a powerful catalyst for new developments in the industry.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emerging technologies shaping crypto</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Howard Lutnick, chairman and CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, in conversation with Chainalysis CEO Michael Gronager, shared his perspective on the evolving relationship between traditional finance and the crypto world, championing the role of stablecoins: “Stablecoins are the most practical, efficient, logical way for people in these emerging markets to hold a dollar&#8230;I am a fan of properly backed stablecoins.” Lutnick highlighted the importance of the dollar&#8217;s dominance and how stablecoins could reinforce America&#8217;s economic strength globally. He expressed skepticism towards cryptocurrencies without practical use cases, preferring instead to focus on innovations that could genuinely integrate with and enhance the financial ecosystem. Michael Gronager echoed the sentiment on the foundational role of crypto in finance, affirming the utility of stablecoins. Lutnick added, once blockchains are operating at scale: “I think that tokenization will be a fundamental part of my business and everyone’s business.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exploring the synergies between AI and crypto, Chainalysis&#8217; Danielle Davis moderated a discussion between Chainalysis’ Chief Scientist Jacob Illum, John Randles of Siren, and Lucas Tcheyan of Galaxy Digital. They talked about how AI could enhance the crypto ecosystem and address its complexities, affirming its potential to empower developers and spur creativity in innovation by unlocking technology to people who lack the specialized skills to bring their ideas to life. “We’re looking to democratize access to more complex things&#8230;ensuring people are not frustrated but successful,” said Illum. The panelists spoke to the nature of AI as experimental and stressed the importance of responsible innovation and the need for a human-centric approach in integrating AI with blockchain. Tcheyan emphasized the necessity of preserving the ethos of crypto as open source, transparent, and accessible.</span></p>
<h2><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-14255" height="600" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/img-0277-800x600.jpg" width="800" /><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
Innovation born of compliance</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chainalysis Co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer Jonathan Levin convened with compliance leaders from leading exchanges: Noah Perlman (Binance), Valerie-Leila Jaber (Coinbase), and CJ Rinaldi (Kraken) to discuss the ever-evolving landscape of crypto compliance. The conversation stressed the importance of collaboration between compliance teams and product engineers. Settlements and consent orders were framed as markers of maturation, validating the continuous nature of compliance work and the ongoing need for investment in systems and controls. The session also touched on the challenges and opportunities of operating at scale and the differences in agility and ability to experiment compared to traditional finance. “The difference between us and TradFi is the speed…the willingness to try and pilot,” said Valerie-Leila Jaber.</span></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-14245" height="534" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/links-day-1-rush-0212-kris-tripplaar-800x534.jpg" width="800" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a session focused on Latin America&#8217;s financial evolution and crypto compliance landscape moderated by Chainalysis’ Daniel Cartolin, Vanessa Araujo Lopes Butalla from 2TM Group/Mercado Bitcoin discussed Brazil&#8217;s leading position in crypto adoption and the country&#8217;s push towards clear regulation and tokenization. “Tokenization of financial contracts is the future and we are working hard to make this a reality,” said Vanessa Araujo Lopes Butalla. Luz del Valle of FV Bank noted a customer base increase for institutional funds, particularly in Argentina, and the other speakers affirmed the institutional shift towards crypto across Latin America. Gabriel Campa from Towerbank shared insights into Panama&#8217;s unique stance on crypto regulation, which leans towards observing United States regulatory actions due to its lack of a central bank. Vanessa Araujo Lopes Butalla spoke to the success of public-private partnerships in Brazil, exemplified by regulatory sandboxes and the Central Bank of Brazil’s landmark project for tokenizing government bonds. The panelists emphasized the importance of education and its challenges and taking cues for regulatory rigor from traditional finance.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto in the context of national security</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A session covering crypto heists perpetuated by North Korea (DPRK) was moderated by author Geoff White, featuring Jessica Peck from the Department of Justice (DOJ), Chris Wong from the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and Chainalyis’ Erin Plante. They dissected DPRK’s extensive involvement in crypto hacks and extortion, such as the </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Axie Infinity bridge hack, which claimed over $600 million — described by Plante as “the largest heist of all time that’s not internal embezzlement”. They discussed how North Korea transitioned into a formidable force in the crypto crime sphere beginning around 2017 to fund its weapons program, primarily through phishing and social engineering. “[Crypto] is the space with the most open sharing between private and public sector, a lot of efforts we make in the North Korea space have a much broader impact,” said Chris Wong.</span></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-14252" height="534" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/links-day-1-rush-0188-kris-tripplaar-800x534.jpg" width="800" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The expertise in this room: The NYPD, in blockchain analytics—sends a signal to those who want to do harm that they cannot hide behind cryptocurrency.”—Alvin Bragg, District Attorney of Manhattan.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">A session presented by the District Attorney’s office of Manhattan gave a behind-the-scenes overview of the landmark case of the People of the State of New York v. Victoria Jacobs, marking the first-ever prosecution and trial for terrorism and cryptocurrency financing within the New York State Court system. Speaking to the collaborative efforts of the New York City Police Department, the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office, and Chainalysis, presenters emphasized the pivotal role of blockchain analytics and the importance of prosecutorial and investigative expertise in addressing the nuanced challenge of terrorist financing through cryptocurrency.</span></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-14251" height="534" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/links-day-1-rush-0219-kris-tripplaar-800x534.jpg" width="800" /></p>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章总结了Chainalysis Links NYC 2024的第一天活动，重点探讨了将加密货币与传统金融整合、区块链监管环境的演变、加密罪案的独特挑战以及创新之路。文章涵盖了行业领袖的演讲、监管洞察、打击加密罪案和激发创新等关键内容。主题包括：CEO Michael Gronager的主题演讲、监管洞察、对抗加密罪案和启发创新。文章强调了跨部门合作与加密货币在金融领域融合的重要性。 <div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the spirit of bringing together the public and private sectors, Day 1 of Chainalysis Links NYC 2024 explored the integration of crypto with traditional finance, the evolving landscape of blockchain regulation, the unique challenges of crypto crime, and the innovations paving the way forward. Industry leaders from both the public and private sectors discussed forging a unified approach to mainstream adoption, strategies for engaging with regulators, and the importance of interoperability and user-centric design.</span></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-14161" height="534" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/links-day-1-rush-0013-kris-tripplaar-800x534.jpg" width="800" /></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keynote by CEO Michael Gronager</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael Gronager set the tone by reflecting on Chainalysis&#8217; decade-long journey and how much the industry has changed in that time. Gronager emphasized that crypto is not about “disrupting finance” but about building new financial infrastructure: “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto will look more like finance before finance looks like crypto.” </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He pointed to major milestones, including $12 billion of net inflows to Bitcoin ETFs in just a few months: “The fastest growing ETF in history.” (Larry Fink, BlackRock)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-14162" height="534" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/links-day-1-rush-0008-kris-tripplaar-800x534.jpg" width="800" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Addressing the early rhetoric that branded crypto as crime-ridden, Gronager emphasized a shift, recognizing that “crypto crime” is just “crime.” A mere </span><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2024-crypto-crime-report-introduction/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">0.34% of cryptocurrency transaction volume</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was confirmed illicit in 2023, however, the growing ubiquity of crypto has made it a tool for all forms of crime. He spoke to how the inherent transparency of blockchain offers “a silver platter” of opportunities for investigation and resolution. He also touched upon the serious implications of crypto in matters of national security, addressing the link between crypto hacks and the funding of DPRK’s missile program. In his closing remarks, Gronager spoke of how Chainalysis is the only source of blockchain analytics </span><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/bitcoin-fog-daubert-hearing-chainalysis/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">deemed reliable enough to be admissible in court</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, with the Chainalysis network instrumental in the seizure of $10 billion of illicit funds.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regulatory insights</span></h2>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chainalysis Co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer Jonathan Levin moderated a discussion between Adrienne Harris, Superintendent of New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) and Congressman Ritchie Torres (D-NY). Harris and Torres discussed the future of crypto regulation, emphasizing the importance of collaboration between regulators and innovators. Harris spoke about how NYDFS had the largest crypto regulation unit in the word and its role in global crypto regulation, while Torres spoke on the legislative perspective, stressing the need for a comprehensive regulatory framework for crypto. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We want to make sure those good innovators are here in the US,” said Harris.</span></strong></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-14169" height="534" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/links-day-1-rush-0056-kris-tripplaar-800x534.jpg" width="800" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
In a session focused on regulatory developments in the United States, Jason Somensatto, Chainalysis’ Head of North American Policy, Alma Angotti of Guidehouse, Marta Belcher of the Filecoin Foundation, and Kara Calvert of Coinbase, discussed the dynamic landscape of crypto regulation in the US. They explored potential policy changes, regulatory uncertainties, and anticipated trends in regulation for 2024 and beyond. Kara Calvert shared insights into Coinbase&#8217;s advocacy work with policymakers, emphasizing the importance of engaging the crypto community and leveraging information for policy influence. Alma Angotti reflected on her enforcement background, noting the challenges crypto companies face in navigating regulatory ambiguities and advocating for clarity. Marta Belcher highlighted Filecoin&#8217;s mission and its efforts to demonstrate the non-financial use cases of blockchain technology to policymakers. The conversation also broached the broader implications of regulatory actions by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other entities on crypto businesses, stressing the need for regulatory clarity to support innovation and maintain the US’s competitive edge in the global market.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-14170" height="534" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/links-day-1-rush-0107-kris-tripplaar-800x534.jpg" width="800" /></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fight against crypto crime</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yevhenii Panchenko of the Ukranian Cyberpolice shared insights into how cryptocurrency has played a role in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Panchenko discussed how the National Police of Ukraine has used Chainalysis over the last five years and the importance of blockchain analytics in combating modern warfare.</span></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-14168" height="534" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/links-day-1-rush-0035-kris-tripplaar-1-800x534.jpg" width="800" /><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
In a session covering the darker side of crypto-related crime, leaders from Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Homeland Security Investigations (HSI), and Queens County, spoke on the increasingly complex landscape of crime where crypto is being used in new and alarming ways. Molly Chambers from Chainalysis, alongside Michael Hanson, the Assistant Director for Intelligence at Customs and Border Protection, and Jonathan Sharp, Deputy Chief of Major Economic Crimes, discussed their encounters with crypto in violent crime like ghost gun sales and murder-for-hire cases, and how it complicates the fight against traditional crimes. Michael emphasized CBP’s analytical work and its push towards enhancing crypto literacy among officers. The conversation concluded stressing the ongoing need for partnership across sectors to navigate the evolving landscape of crypto crime. “This is the reality: that adoption is just going to continue and it is necessary for everybody to become familiar with cryptocurrency.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-14174" height="600" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/gkweca4woaa-cm-800x600.jpeg" width="800" /></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inspiring innovation</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This is the moment that crypto’s gone mainstream.”—Brett Tejpaul, Head of Coinbase Institutional. In a session that took us &#8220;behind the scenes&#8221; of the recent Bitcoin ETF launch, Sari Granat, Chief Operating Officer of Chainalysis sat down with Samara Cohen of BlackRock, Caroline Butler of BNYMellon, and Brett Tejpaul of Coinbase to discussed the impact of the spot bitcoin ETF, its significance for the industry, and the collaboration required for its success. “Don’t underestimate the power of a common language around digital assets. That is going to progress the pathway,” said Samara Cohen of BlackRock.</p>
<p></span></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-14171" height="534" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/links-day-1-rush-0070-kris-tripplaar-1-800x534.jpg" width="800" /><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
In Links’ first-ever Science Fair, Jason Lau, the Chief Innovation Officer at OKX Group, along with Asta Li, the Co-founder and CTO of Privy, and MC Lader, the COO of Uniswap, presented their latest projects, emphasizing the importance of blockchain interoperability, user-centric design, and the potential of on-chain markets.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-14160" height="534" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/links-day-1-rush-0078-kris-tripplaar-800x534.jpg" width="800" /><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
Links NYC &#8217;24&#8217;s most-requested topic was a session exploring tokenization. Caroline Butler of BNY Mellon, Naresh Nagia of Deloitte, and Maredith Hannon of Wisdom Tree, alongside Chainalysis&#8217;s Director of Compliance Caitlin Barnett, took a deep dive into the potential of tokenization for the broader financial ecosystem and their respective organizations. The session addressed the pressing issue of modernizing the cumbersome and outdated process of value transfer, a system largely unchanged since the 1970s. The conversation focused on the benefits of tokenization — using blockchain to digitally represent assets or liabilities — as a means to streamline, expedite, and enhance value transfer. The speakers also acknowledged the challenges of integrating tokenization within regulatory frameworks but framed these as opportunities for making the existing system more efficient and responsive to client needs. The session concluded with a focus on the need for collaboration across the financial sector to fully realize the transformative potential of distributed ledger technology and crypto.</span></p>

<title>What You Need to Know About the Bitcoin Halving</title>
<link>https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/bitcoin-halving-2024/</link>
<guid>https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/bitcoin-halving-2024/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。比特币减半是一个定期发生的事件，旨在确保其稀缺性和价值。矿工在比特币网络中发挥着关键作用，通过解决复杂的算法来验证交易并将其添加到比特币区块链中。减半事件直接影响比特币的供应，减少新比特币进入市场的速度。历史上，比特币的价格在减半事件后有增长的趋势。矿工可能会看到短期利润下降，但随着价格上涨，他们往往能够恢复收入。这种减半事件对比特币生态系统产生影响，预示着比特币未来发展的阶段。 <div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bitcoin halving is a recurring, periodic event programmed into the Bitcoin protocol, designed to ensure its scarcity and, by extension, its value over time. Each halving, the number of new Bitcoin emitted as mining rewards for each new block reduces by half. Halving events are projected to occur through 2140, when Bitcoin reaches its total supply limit of 21 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The halving event is closely watched by a range of network participants, including institutions, traders, and individual investors. The upcoming fourth halving is unique in the Bitcoin ecosystem, marked by a substantial increase in institutional engagement since the last halving occurred in 2020 — along with the integration of traditional financial products such as exchange-traded funds or ETFs. The combined effect of reduced block rewards and significant portions of Bitcoin being bought up and held by institutional long-term investors has led to talk of a compounding supply shock. This, along with the fact that previous halvings have preceded substantial price jumps for Bitcoin, has led many to believe that the halving will lead to a market upswing.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the Bitcoin halving?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bitcoin halving refers to the event that reduces the rate at which new Bitcoins are issued by 50%. This halving event occurs after every 210,000 blocks have been mined, approximately every four years. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The main purpose of the halving is to control Bitcoin inflation by reducing the pace at which new Bitcoins are introduced into the market. This design is a direct response to the inflationary tendency often seen in traditional fiat currencies, where governments can print currency without limits, leading to depreciation in value.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The role of miners in the Bitcoin network</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miners play an essential role in the Bitcoin network, which operates on a </span><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/what-are-blockchains/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">proof-of-work consensus mechanism</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Miners contribute to network security through the mining process, which involves solving complex mathematical algorithms to validate transactions and add them to the Bitcoin blockchain. The mining process not only secures the network against fraudulent transactions and attacks, but also results in the circulation of new Bitcoins as a reward for the miners&#8217; efforts.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Miners, mostly large scale commercial productions, invest substantial resources in the form of hardware and electricity. While it was once possible to mine Bitcoin with a home computer, the introduction of specialized ASIC mining hardware significantly increased the difficulty of mining, making home mining virtually impossible.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The significance of block rewards on the Bitcoin ecosystem</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Block rewards are the incentive mechanism that encourages miners to dedicate computing power to the network. These rewards consist of newly issued Bitcoins given to miners when they successfully solve a block. By rewarding miners, the Bitcoin network ensures that it remains secure and resilient against attacks. The more miners participate, the more decentralized and secure the network becomes. Block rewards are also the only mechanism for net new Bitcoin to enter the market, so the amount miners receive and subsequently decide to sell has important implications for overall supply.  </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">When does Bitcoin halving occur?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin halving is an event that occurs approximately every four years. This reduction in block rewards effectively halves the rate at which new Bitcoins are released into circulation.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Previous Bitcoin halving events</span></h3>
<p><b>First halving: November 28, 2012</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first Bitcoin halving occurred when the block reward was reduced from 50 Bitcoins per block to 25 Bitcoins. This event marked the beginning of Bitcoin&#8217;s journey as a deflationary asset.</span></p>
<p><b>Second halving: July 9, 2016</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second halving further reduced the block reward from 25 Bitcoins to 12.5 Bitcoins per block.</span></p>
<p><b>Third halving: May 11, 2020</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most recent halving reduced the block reward from 12.5 to 6.25 Bitcoins per block.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The actual time between halvings can vary slightly, but on average the time between each halving event has indeed hovered around the four-year mark.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Future Bitcoin halving dates</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given that halving events occur every 210,000 blocks and considering the ten-minute average time to mine a single block, future halvings can be predicted with reasonable accuracy. Slight deviations in the actual timing of halvings are possible due to the variable time it takes to mine blocks.</span></p>
<p><b>Fourth halving:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The Bitcoin fourth halving is anticipated to occur around mid-April 2024, reducing the block reward from 6.25 Bitcoins to 3.125 Bitcoins per block. </span></p>
<p><b>Fifth halving and beyond</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Future halvings will continue at intervals of approximately 210,000 blocks, or roughly every four years, reducing the block reward until the maximum supply of 21 million Bitcoins has been reached. This is estimated to happen in the year 2140.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Bitcoin protocol is designed to produce a block approximately every 10 minutes. Due to the increasing efficiency and computational power of mining equipment, blocks can sometimes be found at slightly faster rates. To maintain the roughly four-year interval between halvings, the Bitcoin network adjusts the difficulty of mining every 2016 blocks, or approximately every two weeks, to ensure that the average time to discover a block remains close to 10 minutes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many other cryptocurrencies, like Litecoin, have adopted similar halving mechanisms, inspired by Bitcoin&#8217;s model, to control the supply of their tokens. The specifics of these events, such as the frequency of halvings and the percentage reduction, can vary significantly from one cryptocurrency to another.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Impact of the Bitcoin halving on the cryptocurrency ecosystem</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the months leading up to a Bitcoin halving, the crypto market often enters a period of heightened anticipation and speculation. Many investors attempt to “price in” the expected reduction in supply, leading to increased volatility and, in some cases, a pre-halving price surge. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Price trends around historical halving events</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historically, the price of Bitcoin has shown a pattern of increasing in value following a halving event.</span></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-14124" height="366" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/price-of-bitcoin-01-2-800x366.png" width="800" /><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">After the 2012 halving, the price of Bitcoin saw a significant increase, rising from $12 in November 2012 to over $1,000 in November 2013.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A similar pattern emerged following the 2016 halving, with the price of Bitcoin increasing from $650 in July 2016 to approximately $2,500 in July 2017, and eventually reaching a new all-time high of $19,700 in December 2017.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the 2020 halving, bitcoin’s price moved upwards from around $8,000 in May 2020 to a new all-time high of over $69,000 in April 2021.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These trends suggest that historically, the price of Bitcoin increases within a year after the halving, but is then followed by a price adjustment period. Unlike the previous halving cycles, Bitcoin reached a new all-time high in March 2024, about a month prior to its upcoming fourth halving.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Supply and demand dynamics</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The halving events directly influence Bitcoin&#8217;s supply by reducing the rate at which new Bitcoins are created. This, coupled with a steady or increasing demand, especially from institutional investors and retail adoption, tends to push the price upwards. The anticipation of this supply squeeze may lead to increased holding behavior among existing Bitcoin owners, further reducing the liquid supply available on exchanges. </span></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-14125" height="340" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/age-distribution-of-all-bitcoin-in-circulation-01-800x340.png" width="800" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The percentage of Bitcoin held by long-term investors (more than 3 years) has shown consistent growth after each halving. Approximately one year after the first halving, the share of Bitcoin held for long-term investors increased by about 73%. The period following the second and third halvings showed modest increases, continuing an overall upward trend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The involvement of ETFs in this halving cycle introduces a new dynamic, potentially heightening the halving&#8217;s impact compared to previous events. This halving could lead to even greater supply shock, driven by the combination of reduced mining rewards and increased institutional buying spurred by the ETFs outpacing the creation of new coins. In turn, this could drastically lower the amount of Bitcoin available for trading, increasing price volatility. </span></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-14126" height="521" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/celsius-limit-increase-01-800x521.png" width="800" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The percentage of Bitcoin held by institutions (clusters that hold more than $10 million) has increased after each halving. Institutions now hold the majority of bitcoin in circulation.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Effects on Bitcoin miners and profitability</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For miners, the halving events reduce the immediate reward for mining new blocks. This can lead to a temporary decrease in profitability, especially for miners with higher operational costs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the price increases following halvings have historically allowed miners to recover revenue despite the reduced block rewards.</span></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-14127" height="396" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/balance-of-mining-pools-before-and-after-the-first-halving-nov-28-2012-01-800x396.png" width="800" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The aggregate balance of mining pools decreased starting around 3-6 months before the first and second halving occurred. This decline is attributed to miners presumably building cash liquidity in anticipation of the reduction in block rewards.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-14128" height="398" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/balance-of-mining-pools-before-and-after-the-second-halving-july-9-2016-1-01-800x398.png" width="800" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> After the first and second halving, the price increased within one year, resulting in a recovery of revenue for miners as the block rewards decreased.</span></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-14129" height="395" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/balance-of-mining-pools-before-and-after-third-halving-may-11-2020-01-800x395.png" width="800" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The third halving exhibited a different pattern compared to the first and second halvings. Established miners seemed to have waited until the bull run to sell their reserves, rather than selling them before the halvings. This could be due to the expectation that the price of Bitcoin would increase following the halving based on the prior two events, making it more profitable to hold for longer.</span></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-14130" height="466" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/balance-of-mining-pools-before-the-fourth-halving-01-800x466.png" width="800" /><br />
<span style="font-weight: 400;">As of the present, ahead of the fourth halving, the reserves have decreased by approximately 23% compared to October 18, 2023, which is approximately 180 days before the anticipated halving date in mid-April. However, this reduction is not as significant as observed during the first and second halvings. This might be attributed to the expectation, similar to the third halving, of cashing out after a further price increase post-halving, or it could be due to the recent significant increase in the price of Bitcoin, allowing for the preparation of short-term strain without the need to sell as much Bitcoin as during the first and second halvings.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What the fourth Bitcoin halving means for crypto</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fundamental mechanics of this halving compared to prior halvings are unchanged: Reducing Bitcoin&#8217;s issuance rate to increase scarcity. However, the broader context in which this upcoming halving occurs is markedly different, with implications extending beyond supply mechanics. <img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-14123" height="498" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/weekly-active-wallets-01-800x498.png" width="800" /></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the backdrop of historic institutional engagement, there&#8217;s an unprecedented level of anticipation. Institutions have not just entered the market, they are now shaping its trajectory, bringing with them a new level of credibility, stability, and interest from mainstream finance. Bitcoin&#8217;s increasing integration into the global economy is paving brand new paths for demand and utility. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The consistent rise in weekly active wallets post-halving demonstrates the growing usage and adoption of Bitcoin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This halving event is just one part of the piece defining the next phase of Bitcoin&#8217;s evolution, potentially impacting pricing, adoption, and solidifying its role within the larger financial landscape of the world.</span></p>

<title>Bitcoin Fog Case Confirms Chainalysis Analytics is Reliable and Admissible in Court</title>
<link>https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/bitcoin-fog-daubert-hearing-chainalysis/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。上个月，华盛顿特区陪审团认定罗曼·斯特林戈夫确实是负责运营比特币雾混合器的个人，并因涉嫌洗钱数千万美元的非法黑网市场活动而被判有罪。此案的判决为Chainalysis的区块链分析提供了法律先例，使其作为证据被广泛认可。法官Randolph Moss认定Chainalysis的区块链分析可靠，并允许其作为法庭证据。这意味着Chainalysis的方法经得起法庭和政府的审查，为使用我们解决方案调查非法活动的机构提供了透明度和可靠性。 <div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last month, a Washington, D.C. jury decided that Roman Sterlingov was indeed the individual who ran the Bitcoin Fog mixer, and subsequently </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc/pr/jury-finds-russian-swedish-operator-bitcoin-fog-guilty-running-darknet-cryptocurrency"><span style="font-weight: 400;">found him guilty</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of laundering tens of millions of dollars from illicit, darknet market activity. The jury also convicted the defendant of running an unlicensed money services business (MSB). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this case had far-reaching implications beyond the conviction. Earlier during the trial,  Judge Randolph Moss of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled in a </span><a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/59988850/259/united-states-v-sterlingov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Daubert </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">order that Chainalysis’s blockchain analytics is reliable and therefore admissible as substantive evidence, despite the defense’s arguments to the contrary. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That Daubert ruling sets a precedent that’s important for several reasons. First, it gives prosecutors a valuable tool to prove guilt at trial. Second, it affirms the auditability and transparency of Chainalysis’s blockchain analytics, which is crucial for the many agencies that rely on our solutions to investigate illicit activity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below, we’ll tell you more about how this ruling came to be and what it means for the future.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chainalysis blockchain analytics is auditable and transparent</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chainalysis’s </span><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/chainalysis-data-accuracy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">attribution and clustering</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of blockchain entities is accurate and verifiable. This fact is of paramount importance to our company and the industry. For that reason, we take a conservative approach, and only attribute a cryptocurrency address to a specific service or wallet when we have directly observable, empirical evidence demonstrating the address belongs to that service or wallet. Similarly, we only cluster new addresses together with those addresses on a deterministic basis. Deterministic methods of data analysis will always yield the same outputs when given the same inputs because they operate based on a set of predefined rules.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Deterministic clustering enables us to reconstruct the cluster representing any given service from scratch, step by step, at any time. This auditability makes internal peer review possible and provides unparalleled transparency into how we arrived at our conclusions. As such, law enforcement agencies and prosecutors can see for themselves how we clustered a given service, and verify the accuracy of our assessments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the Bitcoin Fog case, the defense claimed that Chainalysis operates as a “black box algorithm.” But the evidence that the government presented to the jury demonstrated the exact opposite — our methods are transparent, tested, reviewed, and reliable. Chainalysis expert Beth Bisbee made this clear in her pretrial and trial testimony, during which she meticulously detailed the process through which Chainalysis attributes and clusters blockchain entities in detail. She also drew on her extensive experience using Chainalysis Reactor in hundreds of cases as a DEA Intelligence Research Specialist prior to her employment with the Company, stating that she consistently and successfully relied on Chainalysis analytics when sending subpoenas to services identified as hosting specific addresses relevant to her cases. This is the rigor that courts and governments rightfully demand in order to confirm that Chainalysis blockchain analytics meets the standards of reliability necessary to be admitted in court as substantive evidence. Customers should always be skeptical of providers who claim that standalone visualizations suffice or that they can provide expert witnesses at a moment’s notice.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What happens now?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Roman Sterlingov and his legal team may very well appeal his conviction, as is his right. But Judge Moss’s ruling on blockchain analytics provides a legal paradigm for courts and agencies around the world. The use of Chainalysis blockchain analytics was limited in this case to the attribution and clustering of the Bitcoin Fog mixer and the eight darknet marketplaces that used the mixer to launder funds. Regardless of what happens next for Sterlingov, this hard-fought victory demonstrates that when put to the test, under rigorous conditions, Chainalysis blockchain analytics has borne its burden of reliability. That means that our customers in law enforcement can continue to use our tools to investigate illicit activity, with the confidence that our blockchain analytics can be used to prosecute bad actors successfully.</span></p>

<title>Former IRS-CI Chief Jim Lee: Why I’m Joining Chainalysis</title>
<link>https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/former-chief-jim-lee-joining-chainalysis/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章介绍了一位前IRS-CI主管加入Chainalysis，并继续与执法部门、税务机构、金融机构和监管机构合作，以利用Chainalysis的数据和解决方案来打击金融犯罪。他强调了加密货币是金融的未来，也是犯罪的未来，并分享了他在IRS-CI领导期间对打击犯罪活动的亲身经历。通过装备执法机构最先进的工具和数据，可以确保加密生态系统尽可能安全，让全球人民享受其诸多好处而不受犯罪分子的威胁。 <div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After 29 years, including more than three as Chief of the IRS-CI, my last day of government service was March 31. Today, I’m excited to share that I’ve joined Chainalysis where I’ll continue to work with law enforcement, tax agencies, financial institutions and regulators around the world to help build their capacity to fight financial crime utilizing Chainalysis data and solutions. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto is the future of finance, which also means it’s the future of crime</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the course of my career in law enforcement, the illicit world has become increasingly more complex, with allied governments today confronting a myriad of threats from both a criminal and national security standpoint. But one thing has remained constant: Virtually all forms of crime are financially motivated. That means that any technological advancement in how we interact with money will inevitably become a tool for virtually all those involved in nearly all forms of crime, </span><b>even if that advancement is net beneficial to humanity.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Criminals are adaptable and always on the lookout for the next way they can exploit the public.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve seen firsthand that this is the case for cryptocurrency. Crypto has brought greater transparency and efficiency to finance, and we’re still in the early innings. I believe that with time, this technology can continue to give people more control over their money and heighten financial inclusion around the world. However, criminals of all stripes have also been quick to adopt cryptocurrency. We fought against this in several notable cases during my time leading IRS-CI, including:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/hydra-garantex-ofac-sanctions-russia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shutting down Hydra</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the world’s largest darknet market, where criminals sold everything from hard drugs to money laundering services</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Conducting the largest ever crypto seizure connected to terrorism financing in an operation against </span><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/cryptocurrency-terrorism-financing-al-qaeda-al-qassam-brigades-bitcointransfer/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hamas’ al-Qassam Brigades</span></a></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/chainalysis-doj-welcome-to-video-shutdown/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Rescuing 23 children</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and arresting 337 child abusers around the globe after taking down Welcome to Video, the world’s largest cryptocurrency CSAM marketplace</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those are just three examples, but they’re reflective of the fact that cryptocurrency is, at least in part, being used for a wide range of nefarious activities, and will only become more so as adoption grows. But by equipping law enforcement agencies with the best-in-class tools and data to fight this activity, we can ensure that the crypto ecosystem remains as safe as possible, so that people around the world can realize its many benefits without fear of being targeted by criminals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ll also notice that Chainalysis played some role in all three of the cases I cited, whether by providing tools that aided the case directly or by alerting the public to criminal activity taking place. That brings me to why I chose to continue my mission at Chainalysis specifically: The company has led the way from the private sector in making cryptocurrency safe, just as I and my colleagues in law enforcement have done from the public sector. No other organization in the industry has more firmly placed itself on the side of justice, and I can’t think of a better place to continue my life’s work.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can’t wait to get started</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Global Head of Capacity Building, I’ll be working to better enable the men and women in law enforcement to thwart many threats in parallel — just like I have been for the last 29 years — and will primarily focus on helping international agencies develop solutions against cryptocurrency-based crime to start. I’ll also have the chance to help crypto businesses and financial institutions in the private sector build and maintain robust compliance programs. These efforts will help Chainalysis in its mission to make the cryptocurrency ecosystem safer, and I can’t wait to get started. </span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章介绍了Chainalysis庆祝成立10周年的重要性，并展示了他们针对客户需求进行创新的三个综合解决方案：Crypto Investigations、Crypto Risk和Web3 Growth。文章强调了加密货币作为世界经济的一部分的增长，并讨论了加密货币在犯罪活动中的使用。Chainalysis致力于帮助客户完成任务，并扩展了他们的解决方案。他们还介绍了最新的实验性功能，并将在年度会议上分享更多有关解决方案的增强信息。 <div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chainalysis celebrates its 10th birthday this spring, and we’re reflecting on how far we’ve come with our customers and how we’re continuing to evolve with the rapidly changing ecosystem. The market revival we are experiencing now doesn’t seem like just another cycle, but a sign of the maturation of the ecosystem. Continued innovation in blockchain technology along with its integration into traditional finance suggests that crypto is delivering on its promise to </span><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/the-value-of-the-internet-of-value/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">transform the exchange of value</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, much like the internet did for the exchange of information. We’re inspired by our customers who are building and shaping the future of the industry. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, we’re introducing a new framework for Chainalysis solutions that reflects how we’re continuing to innovate with the industry and enhancing our customers’ experience. Our three holistic solutions – </span><b>Crypto</b> <b>Investigations, Crypto Risk, and Web3 Growth</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – are designed to harness Chainalysis data to better meet our customers’ needs for specific workflows. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As cryptocurrency grows and becomes more entwined with the world economy, it’s increasingly used by both good and bad actors. As such, we’re seeing it crop up in all forms of crime, not just “</span><a href="https://go.chainalysis.com/crypto-crime-2024.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">crypto crime</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">” such as ransomware and darknet markets. Our government customers are uncovering the use of crypto as financial rails in investigations ranging from gang activity and violent crime to disinformation campaigns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With our </span><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/solution/crypto-investigations/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">investigations solution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> – including capabilities formerly known as Reactor and Storyline – our goal is to help our customers achieve their missions by harnessing the transparency of blockchains. Now, we&#8217;re focused on revolutionizing the graphing software that we first invented, modernizing the infopanel, and launching Chainalysis Labs, a sandbox for research and development that will introduce our power users to the latest experimental features. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our </span><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/solution/crypto-risk/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">risk solution</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> helps the most innovative private sector companies protect their platforms from abuse by illicit actors. Including capabilities previously known as Know Your Transaction (KYT) and Address Screening, Crypto Risk can be tailored to meet businesses’ risk strategies and policies. Soon, risk teams will be able to assess the risk of specific assets through the introduction of Asset Intelligence.

<h2><b>Transcript</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey everyone. Welcome to another episode of Public Key. This is your host, Ian Andrews. Today I&#8217;m joined by my friend and CXO at Solidus Labs Chen Arad. Chen, welcome to the program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chen:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you so much, Ian. It&#8217;s a pleasure and honor to be here and I probably mentioned to you at some point my name, it&#8217;s very confusing. It&#8217;s spelled Chen, but it&#8217;s actually pronounced [inaudible 00:00:25], which is from Israel we have those biblical sounds in Hebrew. But I don&#8217;t expect everyone to be able to pronounce it, so you could call me Chen, but just as an icebreaker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I love it. I am notoriously poor at pronouncing people&#8217;s names correctly, and it drives me crazy because my name frequently gets mispronounced so people will call me Andrew, misreading my last name. So I&#8217;m very sensitive to it. Thank you for correcting me. I need to work on my Hebrew so that I can make that sound. We&#8217;ll do that offline though. I won&#8217;t put people through it here on the podcast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chen:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s a great language, but if you&#8217;re eyeing a new language, I would vote for Mandarin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the number of people who speak it. That is probably the good bet to take. Chen, you and I have been talking about doing this for quite a while, I think maybe close to a year, so I&#8217;m super happy that you&#8217;re here. I am sure people have heard, that are listening to this podcast, have heard of your company. I actually want to start with your background a little bit because I think you have an unusually circuitous path to working in crypto. So maybe give us your crypto origin story.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chen:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Absolutely, and I should mention that I&#8217;m very much the exception among our founding and leadership team. Most of us have a deep banking and traditional finance technology background, and my two co-founders came from Goldman. Many others on our team. I, however, as mentioned is the exception. I actually used to be a journalist before founding Solidus. In the Israeli military, I served in the Press Corps and after that got just fascinated with the world of journalism and started doing a lot of writing television broadcasts both in Israel and from the US when I moved here for school. So while I was in college, Brandeis University, shout out to the judges, I did a lot of reporting coverage of many, many various topics all the way from finance and technology, which obviously has become very relevant to my favorite topic, which was actually writing about food.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;ll say one thing about that, it&#8217;s obviously rather unusual. I don&#8217;t meet a lot of people who started as journalists and became entrepreneurs. In the journalism world it always feels a little bit like a sellout, but I am actually consistently amazed by how similar really the core of the work is that I used to do then to what it is today. Journalism is a lot about finding complex but important issues and turning them into compelling stories. And at the end of the day, entrepreneurship business is very much about that and you as a marketing leader would absolutely know that, so unusual background, but somehow surprisingly relevant until today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, it&#8217;s amazing and I love the point you made there because storytelling, I think in early technology markets is one of the things that people tend to miss. They build a cool product and they want to tell everyone about the product and they forget that for most people who probably weren&#8217;t working on the product, they don&#8217;t care. You have to give them a reason to care and that is the story that helps them appreciate the problem that you discovered, that led you to build the product in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chen:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s such an important point and I think it&#8217;s particularly pertinent in crypto. Because we are so enthusiastic as an industry about the technology that we sometimes forget that over-technologizing, and I&#8217;m sorry, English is not my native language, so I might be a bit flexible with how I use it sometimes. But over-technologizing it&#8217;s not necessarily the best way to reach public adoption, to speak to regulators. And we have tended to do that historically. I actually think that thanks to the leadership of many folks like yourself, we&#8217;ve gotten better at it as an industry over the years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah. Tell me about the time, when did you first encounter crypto?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chen:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So it&#8217;s funny, in the quick little warm-up conversation we had right before this, we talked a little bit about inspirations. And in my case, I very much through my co-founder and dear friend Asaph Meir. Him and I were actually college buddies. And throughout college we were always like at some point we should start a startup, we should start a startup. I ended up staying there for another few years of school. He ended up going to work for Goldman Sachs. And I should say right off the top that I&#8217;ve always found Asaph inspiring and I&#8217;ve always knew that he&#8217;s one of the smartest people I know While at Goldman, he and Praveen our third co-founder who is Indian and who met Asaph at Goldman, they became very involved with crypto through some of the internal conversations at the bank at the time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And around that time, I mean I obviously heard about Bitcoin earlier on, but being very honest and I think that&#8217;s important because people always wonder if it&#8217;s too late to join crypto right now. I remember thinking that in 2017, being very honest, really engaging with it and becoming excited about the possibilities it brings to make finance more accessible, to create more optionality in how we manage our wealth. That&#8217;s when I got really excited and I guess the rest is history. I&#8217;m not sure how to finish that sentence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s amazing. So around the time that Asaph and your third co-founder discovered, yeah, Praveen started discovering crypto at Goldman, they turned you onto it as well. Take me from that moment to deciding to launch Solidus. What led you down that path?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chen:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So what led me down the path is very much Asaph&#8217;s leadership. Again, we were always interested in entrepreneurship and trying something. It obviously converged with us becoming increasingly passionate about crypto. And what was interesting for us at the time is I remember stories about how in 2017 while we were having these conversations, some of the big banks in the world were still adapting some of their compliance and risk capabilities and systems following the 2008 crisis. It was very clear to us that even with assets and ways of conducting finance that have existed for decades, the risk and compliance question can be very challenging for large organizations and the government to regulate them and consumers to adapt to. And with crypto or blockchain based finance, we&#8217;ll probably use a lot of different terms throughout the conversation. The fundamental infrastructure that it brought was so different that it was clear to us that the challenge is going to be even greater.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that there&#8217;s an opportunity not only for crypto to transform finance, but for firms like ours Chainalysis, which of course existed I believe since 2013 or 14, to also transform the way financial risk is monitored and the way it&#8217;s regulated. And also being very frank at the time we saw that there are great companies, Chainalysis was the leader that are specialized in the on-chain transaction tracing. What we didn&#8217;t see a lot of people talk about is market manipulation. I mean that&#8217;s not exactly precise, because there was a lot of talk about market manipulation. I remember as early as 2018 reading reports, I think the one Bitwise included in one of its earlier ETF applications with numbers like 95% of the volume is manipulative, 75% of volume is manipulative.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was all very top to bottom. It was very clear to us that while the digital asset world loves to talk about decentralization and the assets are truly decentralized, the vast majority of the activity, the trading 90, 95% is actually centralized and that just looking on chain is not going to be enough to really understand market integrity, you need to be able to monitor for market abuse and other forms of illicit finance cross on and off chain. And we set up to build Solidus as the category definer for crypto native market surveillance as Citigroup later in 2021 named us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is amazing because I think anyone that&#8217;s familiar with equity markets like this concept of market surveillance, market integrity well known. There&#8217;s been rules around that for a long time. There&#8217;s lots of technology in place as well as regulations to ensure that there&#8217;s a modicum of fairness, I would say, in the way that equities or bonds or commodities are traded. But I&#8217;m also going to guess back in 2018 when you launched the company, that may not have been the reaction, particularly from folks in crypto. Take us back to that moment. How did people react? Were they clamoring for the product or was it something else?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chen:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let me put it that way. I have very, very vivid memories of going to conferences 2017, 2018. Even the more, let&#8217;s call it institutional oriented conferences at the time, what we call RWAs today at the time was people called security tokens. Anyway, they were actually conferences that were quite institutional oriented. But anyway, I have very vivid memories of going to conferences at the time saying we&#8217;re Solidus, we provide a crypto market surveillance solution and getting a lot of raised eyebrows. Best case scenario we would often get, what does that even mean? Worst case scenario, we did actually get at the time something that I don&#8217;t think we would hear today, but at the time we would also get some, &#8220;What are you here to ruin the party?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now we thought differently. We thought it&#8217;s really important. We thought it&#8217;s not possible to really invite the investing public retail and institutional into this if we&#8217;re not better at ensuring that the prices they&#8217;re getting are fair and integrity driven. And so the response was oftentimes that way. It is important to say, very rarely has anyone told me directly, we don&#8217;t want this, it&#8217;s not important. Adoption took a little longer as the industry continued to grow. I always remember that in 2018 April, 2018, the CEO of one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world said publicly and on purpose intentionally crypto traders don&#8217;t want or care about market manipulation. I don&#8217;t think anyone would say that today by 2020 there was already a high level of adoption and I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ll get to it later, but the regulatory landscape is really shifting towards requiring this sort of solutions. So it&#8217;s a constant acceleration in terms of adoption. But yes, five, six years ago, not quite the same.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of skepticism, which is actually very consistent with the Chainalysis journey as well, I&#8217;d imagine. I think initially the company was seen as, like you said, ruining the party. But as more and more serious people who have come into the space that&#8217;s shifted and they almost expect these kind of guardrail or protection technologies to be available and when they&#8217;re not, it&#8217;s a concerning red flag that&#8217;s keeping a lot of people on the sidelines. I guess I would have to imagine the ETFs being approved because one of the major objections to ETF approval was lack of market integrity. That had to be a crowning moment, a vindication of the necessity for what you all have built.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chen:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Look, first of all, I think it&#8217;s a crowning moment and a moment of celebration for the industry as a whole. I, for a long time, I think it&#8217;s fair to say I was slightly in a minority opinion amongst the industry. Because I actually, I think I read every single rejection document over the years. I&#8217;m not sure if that&#8217;s something I should be proud of or not, but I&#8217;m a bit obsessed for the matter. And while I&#8217;ve always wanted and hoped for the ETF to be approved as soon as possible, I also always thought that there is a point to what the SEC is saying. Because to me, the piece in the rejection document that was really around what&#8217;s referred to as shared surveillance and the ability to understand if manipulation happened across multiple markets, it really speaks to how different and unique Bitcoin and therefore most blockchain based assets are.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The way I summarize it in my head is really it was about the fact that this is the first example of a non-physical asset that is not owned or is native to one particular platform. At the end of the day, an Apple stock or any stock, it has many derivatives. It&#8217;s traded in many, many ways, but ultimately the spot market is usually in one place. And if it&#8217;s not, maybe there are a few other ones, they&#8217;re also defined while Bitcoin ultimately can be traded anywhere by anyone whenever they want, the reality of decentralized assets is that, no one will ever be able to surveil every single trade everywhere. And the way I always read the language in the rejection documents was basically the SEC is saying, &#8220;Okay, so we understand that over the years it also of course evolved with the industry. We understand that there are exchanges and important exchanges that are regulated and surveil. We understand that we even approved a futures ETF Right based on CME&#8217;s futures market.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So we understand that we can get confidence that there&#8217;s no manipulation within those individual markets, but how do we know hypothetically that there isn&#8217;t 100 colluding actors that are creating thousands of wallets and are doing small trades across thousands of venues that are very hard to capture and therefore ultimately the price is manipulated and we won&#8217;t have the ability to know and it might affect us investors. So that to me is a fundamental infrastructural challenge created by the advent of decentralized blockchain based assets. That being said, we have to remember when we have this conversation that it&#8217;s not like traditional finance is perfectly unmanipulable, so ultimately that&#8217;s a problem that there are a lot of really smart people here at Solidus and other places as well thinking about how to solve that in a way that doesn&#8217;t also impale the idea of decentralization.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are really interesting conversations on cross market surveillance that various regulators and non regulators are hosting. But at some point also I think, and that&#8217;s ultimately what happened in the way my interpretation of the ultimate approval, it&#8217;s been enough time that crypto has grown enough, enough organizations have raised the standards of the integrity of their platforms through including surveillance and other guidelines. We have some really, really thoughtful smart compliance teams and crypto that actually larger market surveillance teams and cryptos can often be larger than in traditional finance and mend, or should I say full of people who come from traditional finance and over time ultimately with the help of some legal pressure where essentially in the grayscale case the court sort of said, &#8220;You can&#8217;t keep on, this is not justifying rejecting it, that it was time to approve it.&#8221; It was a crowning moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do believe that our work advancing market integrity individually with our clients and of course through engagements with across the industry, years of co-chairing market integrity, code of conduct working groups and stuff like that was important. It&#8217;s also just about the industry maturing and understanding, again, like the process I described earlier that you cannot grow if you don&#8217;t address this. But the fundamental infrastructural challenge still remains, and there&#8217;s a lot of work that&#8217;s being done in order to over time essentially live up to the trust given to us with that ETF approval. And, it&#8217;s kind of make sure we work with regulators and as an industry to introduce the right frameworks again that enable the potential of decentralization by mitigating the risks, but without impaling what decentralization can and should be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah. It&#8217;s such an interesting challenge. I mean, I think as we&#8217;re recording this, just a week ago there was a flash crash in one of the bigger exchanges who&#8217;s maybe more known for their derivatives business than their spot market, and at least the initial suggestions were that there was a single trader who was dumping large blocks, selling large blocks of Bitcoin. And for a moment, I think maybe up to an hour you could have purchased at a price that was somewhere south of 10,000 USD despite the broad market price obviously being in the mid to upper 60s. And so I think that is case in point of the distributed nature of the trading venues. In the US I think there&#8217;s five stock market like equity trading venues and they&#8217;re all fairly well-connected and all the brokerages who are able to trade on them are also fairly well-connected. So there&#8217;s very rarely a moment where you have a price dislocation even for a few seconds of variance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chen:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Right, and it&#8217;s interesting, someone on our team pointed out to me that in traditional finance the thresholds are quite low, like for securities, if the price goes up or down very abruptly, more than a few percentages, it could actually justify reversing the trades. And that ultimately leads also to&#8230; That&#8217;s not something you can do with a completely decentralized asset. You could maybe in one platform but not for the entire asset, and again, that I think is a great kind of another angle into that fundamental infrastructural challenge, so thank you for saying that. I will say, look, it&#8217;s not the only case of a flash crash or a flash jump. I mean these things happen. It is ultimately, they happen even in Bitcoin, which is obviously the most liquid market. And yes, they really speak to the challenge of what happens in each individual exchange off-chain compared to what happens in the broad market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The one thing I would say is that, when something like that happens, having a strong surveillance program is absolutely critical because you can with the ride on and off-chain risk monitoring and surveillance program, you can within minutes understand exactly what happened and whether it requires more severe steps or not, and what needs to be done in order to put things back to order, and of course to also provide a response to regulators and the public. I will also say that in the longer run, one of the interesting things about market events in traditional finance is that it&#8217;s not done in real time. It&#8217;s always usually T plus one, T plus two. Essentially you take all of the data and then you look at it and see if something happened that it was wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think there&#8217;s a good chance that crypto is going to drive a change to that with real time if you really monitor the trading in real time and look at the right data sources. Again, the key here is on and off chain, you can actually, we believe, prevent it in certain cases. But at the very least you&#8217;ll know about it very, very quickly so that actions can be taken. And I think that, again, I have three examples in my head at least of very, very abrupt price changes that happens in specific spot markets. And again, what really makes the difference there is if you have a smart team that is able to respond quickly with the right program and technology in place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah. You&#8217;ve mentioned a couple of times this idea of on-chain plus off-chain data. Be more specific. When you talk about off-chain data, what are you imagining? I can guess order book data on centralized exchanges would be one really important data set because that&#8217;s where so much of trading activity, as much as we talk about DeFi, so much of the actual trading activity is happening inside of an exchange order book. Maybe over-the-counter trading desk data would be potentially another source, although I don&#8217;t know how easy that is to access. What&#8217;s in the universe of data that Solidus uses to achieve some of the market surveillance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chen:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I would venture to make a lofty statement. I genuinely believe that this cross on and off-chain risk monitoring function is absolutely fundamental to addressing market integrity in crypto. It requires collaboration between companies like ours, but it also requires a recognition that while we love to talk about decentralization and we love to talk about on-chain, the majority of the activity trading activity, price formation, etc, happens off-chain. Now because when we started the company, we really focused on that market manipulation question and because most of the trading and therefore trading manipulation happened off-chain, really something that we spent a lot of time and resources figuring out the best way to address and monitor for market abuse, market manipulation with off-chain data. Off-chain data specifically, I mean you called it order book data. At the end of the day, I think a centralized crypto exchange in a lot of ways is you take a digital asset, you take a blockchain-based asset and you force it into a familiar order book setting which was developed and perfected with centralized assets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now it&#8217;s critical. It creates a lot of efficiencies. It&#8217;s absolutely the gateway for most people who trade in crypto, and it&#8217;s probably also how I believe over time, most people will continue to engage with digital assets because the reality is that most people prefer to work through an intermediary at least in the foreseeable future. But it&#8217;s not the fact that you put it into an order book, does not mean that it&#8217;s exactly the same as a centralized or let&#8217;s say a security in an order book. There&#8217;s so much just the fact that crypto is 24/7 with different numbers of decimal points, etc. Those are pretty trivial, but they actually create huge operational issues in terms of being able to monitor for manipulative behavior. But the fact that the asset is also at the same time, the price is also formed through activity and a lot of other exchanges and on chain just means that it&#8217;s centralized or not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like crypto data and crypto trading is different to process and there are new risks that are not necessarily familiar from traditional finance. There are also a lot of ways to execute similar kinds of manipulation differently and therefore they need to be detected differently. But anyway, to your point, off-chain trading data order book data, which some of it is made public and there&#8217;s a lot of obviously companies that do great work standardizing and allowing the purchase of data, but ultimately for a full understanding and confidence that there&#8217;s no market manipulation, you do need to look at the full depth including cancellations, including order, including all orders, etc, that&#8217;s a big part of it. There are other kinds of off chain data, which is really important. For example, we specialize in the market manipulation, market surveillance piece, but another piece of data we work with a lot is off chain transaction data. Versus deposits from wallets or into wallets versus transactions that take place on the blockchain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of the day, there&#8217;s just a lot of off-chain transactions on centralized ledgers. And some of it is crypto to fiat, some of it is fiat, but because they happen in correlation to digital assets, that&#8217;s also a very important piece that can help indicate malicious behavior and oftentimes needs to be connected to what comes from the on chain analysis that obviously you guys specialize in. There&#8217;s also other examples, things like news data, which is quite critical. That&#8217;s off chain just simply because it&#8217;s not on chain, which is very listing announcements, stuff like that. And also there&#8217;s a lot of other forms of risk related data. It could be KYC, it could be other things. The bottom line is that we really specialize in the trading piece, but by looking at all of these off chain data pieces and then connecting them through integrations that we are very happy to have with a partner like Chainalysis and also just looking at Dex-Trades on-chain, etc, that&#8217;s where ultimately the best picture can be provided on market integrity individually for platforms and for the market as a whole.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the challenges of off-chain data is that it&#8217;s private and it should be private. And of course, but in that sense it can be become a bit of a black box from the perspective of regulators, from the perspective of blockchain sleuths. And so again, being able to create that connectivity is really core to our mission and core to solving, I believe the market integrity question. I&#8217;ll just mention that I was in Japan quite recently. The Japan Financial Services Authority invited us, they also invited Chainalysis. Caroline Malcolm was there and rocked the floor as usual with her incredible policy work, but they specifically invited&#8230; I was specifically on a panel that was based on a paper the JFSA published specifically on the importance of on chain and off chain risk analysis to understand the health of decentralized ecosystems. Which I remember when they published that paper in July, it was one of the happiest days of my life because I was like, yes, we&#8217;re getting there, they get it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So just to give an example of the fact that there&#8217;s also, there&#8217;s some language about it in Mika&#8217;s technical standards that were just put out for consultation and across the board you&#8217;re seeing that there&#8217;s a recognition that full market integrity picture requires the cross section of on and off chain data.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, it&#8217;s so amazing. I want to talk a little bit more about the risks that you touched on in that last comment. You guys actually published a great report. We&#8217;ll link to it in the show notes. Everybody should go download it and read the whole thing. But some of the stats here kind of blew me away. In particular, insider trading and wash trading seem to be much more widespread than I sense the market at large appreciates. I think you published that about 56% of token listings since 2021 had some evidence of insider trading. Can you talk about, unpack that statistic for us? How did you come to that assertion? What does that really mean for us as users of crypto?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chen:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, absolutely. So our report, it&#8217;s important to say that ultimately it&#8217;s a sample of the market. It looked at a few very large, some of the largest exchanges in the world, centralized exchanges. And essentially at all of the ERC20 tokens or the most of the ERC20 tokens that were already available on decentralized exchanges, but then listed on those centralized platforms between January 2021, and I believe mid-2022. So important to say it&#8217;s a sample, but every platform is different, et cetera. But bottom line is that, we think it&#8217;s a pretty good representation. Really what it looked at, it used, we have a tool that specializes in identifying this sort of insider trading. It looked at instances essentially when there&#8217;s a listing where someone in a very precise way, somehow he was able to buy the token in the few days to a week before the listing and then somehow miraculously also sold it immediately within minutes after the listing itself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Insider trading is not something crypto invented, and I&#8217;ll emphasize again, none of the things almost that I&#8217;m going to talk about today are stuff that crypto invented. Unfortunately, traditional finance, someone gave you the estimation that 10 to 15% of all corporate news is accompanied by some sort of insider dealing. So it&#8217;s not something that crypto invented, but it&#8217;s obviously, it&#8217;s very interesting to regulators because it&#8217;s almost obviously legal depending on the definition of the asset, but it&#8217;s absolutely obviously wrong because what it means is that someone had information and they unfairly used it to make benefit against just normal investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So as you said, the finding was that in 56% of those listings, they were accompanied by very suspicious evidence of those sort of buys and sells. It&#8217;s important to say that it&#8217;s not necessarily&#8230; Oftentimes the immediate thought when you talk about insider trading is the listing exchange. Someone at the listing exchange probably knew, but it&#8217;s not necessarily the platforms. There&#8217;s enough people who could have access to this sort of information by virtue of being part of a project that&#8217;s being listed, maybe an investor. And interestingly, there&#8217;re also because of the transparency of the blockchain, there are also ways in which sophisticated actors sometimes are able to just recognize just looking at on-chain activity that there is certain interest from a centralized exchange in an asset. And then sometimes, and there are various new ways because of the transparency of decentralized assets that MNPI material, non-public information could be created.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the bottom line is, I mean, look, we think long and hard every time before we, as I&#8217;m sure you do. Every time before we publish a research like that, because we are part of the industry, we want it to succeed. We&#8217;re huge believers that sunlight is the best disinfectant. And that markets that aren&#8217;t fair don&#8217;t last, and crypto is not going to manifest its potential if it&#8217;s ultimately markets that are driven by insiders. So anyway, that was the main takeaway from that report. And again, it&#8217;s very interesting to regulators because insider dealing, unlike say if you talk about, I don&#8217;t know, block level, front running, it&#8217;s something that regulators and law enforcement agencies really get. And I will mention that there have been a couple of cases in the US, one of them with a former Coinbase employee and one of them with a former OpenSea employee that actually ended in jail sentences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, it&#8217;s a very serious problem. I think the other one that came up for me reading the report was about wash trading. And we&#8217;ve done some research on this as well at Chainalysis, and it&#8217;s interesting because there&#8217;s certain platforms that actually seem to encourage it, a number of marketplaces that have a reward system for trading. And depending on the economic model that&#8217;s applied to that reward system, it can be very lucrative to pay the gas fees to send an asset back and forth to yourself, two wallets that you control, collect the reward for the trade, and then you&#8217;re profiting from not real activity. I am kind of curious, you made the comment that insider trading obviously makes an unfair market that ultimately doesn&#8217;t last. Only fair markets kind of become enduring. Would you apply the same logic to wash trading? Because it does seem like some folks, they&#8217;re encouraging it to demonstrate traction on a platform and build a following.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chen:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, well, I think the bottom line is, is it real traction or is it made up traction? And look, we come from marketing and content and there&#8217;s always an element of you need to get things going, you need to create some traction. But let&#8217;s talk about the wash trading report for a second because it is, I would say a little different for a few reasons. Insider trading at the end of the day is very straightforward wash trading, let&#8217;s define it briefly. Ultimately it&#8217;s about non-economical trading. It&#8217;s essentially where one trader or collusion between a few of them trade back and forth to create volume without the price changing. It&#8217;s essentially about artificially inflating volumes. Now, the way we approached it, so obviously that particular, while the insider trading report really looked at that cross-section between on and off-chain, decentralized exchanges and centralized exchanges, wash trading, we really looked up purely at decentralized liquidity pools. And that obviously trading there works mechanically different.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s not the same kind of order book mechanism and bid and ask. And wash trading has been defined based on a centralized order book. Wash trading at the end of the day, we needed to do some, we proposed essentially a definition that we believe aligns with the original definition of wash trading, but really it&#8217;s about understanding when a particular actor creates artificial volume. In that particular case, and by the way, it&#8217;s detailed really well in the report and written by people who are way smarter than me. So for anyone who&#8217;s interested, I really suggest digging into it. It&#8217;s available for free. But basically we looked specifically for what we anticipated would be problematic liquidity pools mostly on Uniswap, which at the end of the day is the largest and most significant decentralized trading protocol.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And there are a few definitions that go into it, but specifically we looked at cases where one wallet or a group of very clearly associated wallets are responsible for providing more than 90% of the liquidity to a particular pool, and then is also responsible for more than 50% of the swaps either directly from the same wallet or again through other wallets. Obviously, when you have a situation like that, it does not look like real trading. By the way, it&#8217;s not necessarily illegal, it&#8217;s unregulated trading. But do we think that it&#8217;s legitimate liquidity? I mean, I think there are some questions around it. Obviously we&#8217;re interested in market manipulation as a whole. Part of the reason it was important for us to demonstrate that this does exist and unfortunately not at a small amount. We found around 2 billion worth of wash traded assets using that scheme.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The reason it was important for us is because, and by the way, tell me if you agree, but I&#8217;ve always felt that there&#8217;s a bit of a sentiment that wash trading and artificial volume is not possible on Dexs. Because it&#8217;s not profitable, the gas fees are too high, which all of it is correct, but the bottom line is that we very, using our tech, we were able to find quite a bit of this and really when we limited it to a small subsection of Dexs. What I will say is that while the insider trading report, I believe is actually quite, it does extrapolate, my hunch is that it does extrapolate for the broader industry. The wash trading one doesn&#8217;t because we did specifically look for places where that might happen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I think we looked at around 30,000 liquidity pools, and again, based on those very specific definitions, and we about 67% of them had evidence of this sort of behavior. I don&#8217;t think that 67% extrapolates for the entire decentralized exchange landscape. So it is important to say that I actually think that if you look at it, it&#8217;s potentially very good news. It shows to regulators that yes, there is wash trading, but it&#8217;s generally contained. And again, there&#8217;s more research to be done, and we are working with a lot of decentralized exchanges in order to understand how, again, you can monitor for these risks without limiting decentralization. But I actually thought it was good news because it&#8217;s not that common. The last point I would say, and I&#8217;m sorry, I tend to talk a lot, so feel free to just tell me to move on to the next one, but the last thing I&#8217;ll just say briefly is that it&#8217;s about 50% of the liquidity pairs that we looked at included one token that we also assessed to be a malicious, hard-coded smart contract scam.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, that makes a lot of sense because if you deploy a hard-coded ragpoll scam as a token and you want to get people to invest in it, they might not know that there&#8217;s pieces of code that mean that you can deposit and not withdraw, etc. One of the best ways to make people feel like it&#8217;s legit is create some liquidity around it, but that&#8217;s not the only case in which it happens. We&#8217;ve also identified cases where they&#8217;re completely or at least seemingly legitimate tokens, in which case we suspect it might be money laundering or who knows. But the bottom line is that the volume does not seem legitimate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, it&#8217;s consistent with research that we&#8217;ve done as well, which is indicative that there&#8217;s a class of tokens that get deployed on the Ethereum network, and this would probably apply to other networks as well, but we specifically focused on Ethereum is just the biggest one where a small number of individuals are creating new tokens, deploying them, creating enough liquidity that they can actually list on a Dex, promoting it in some way, drawing in investor liquidity, and then running off with a real asset, whatever the trading pair that was deposited actually is. In individual instance most of these are relatively small. This isn&#8217;t like a dog with hat or pet Bitcoin or something like that. It&#8217;s stuff that 99% of people that participate in the ecosystem have never heard of. Where it&#8217;s thousands of dollars of liquidity are being stolen. But there were some outliers that were quite a bit larger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And I think wash trading is just one of a few tactics that can be used to promote some interest and followership often combined with the social media campaign, often combined with conspirators who are working alongside that are maybe legitimate trades in the context of being multiple parties, not just a single person trading with themselves, but it&#8217;s coordinated trading activity. So my advice to everyone is operate with caution. There&#8217;s likely somebody on the other side of the trade that has more information than you do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chen:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, absolutely. And look, and it&#8217;s true again in traditional finance, I cannot stress that enough.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, absolutely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chen:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, I mean, I think JP Morgan just got a massive fine for issues with their surveillance system, and it happens. You always have to be cautious, and we as an industry need to not let our enthusiasm make us forget to remind people that at the end of the day, you have to be cautious specifically when it&#8217;s a new trading environment rooted in new technology and when there&#8217;s so much FOMO. And you guys, I read all of your reports. You&#8217;ve done incredible work also exposing some of this stuff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, thank you. I want to, we&#8217;re running out of time here. I want to make sure that we hit on my favorite and customary closing question, which is, you all have built an amazing business over the last six years. You&#8217;ve made a lot of progress even bringing to the forefront this concept of market surveillance is being necessary and useful in the world of blockchain and cryptocurrency. Where do we go from here? What&#8217;s on the horizon over the next year that you&#8217;re really excited about?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chen:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, knock on wood, and I&#8217;ll actually knock here on wood. I think there&#8217;s a lot of signals that indicate we&#8217;re entering a bull market. A bull market is an incredible moment always, and we&#8217;ve been through a few by now, so you need to be careful and take things with a grain of salt. But with the bull market, of course, volumes increase, interest increase, more investors come in, et cetera, et cetera. And we have an opportunity to show that we&#8217;ve learned from the last few rounds. It&#8217;s funny, I was just in Singapore for our Docom Singapore event and I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time there recently and really became inspired with Lee Kuan Yew, the founding father of Singapore. Just an incredible, incredible thinker. One of our employees there, shout out to Justin Lin, gave me the book as a present and been diving into it, and he talks&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I was kind of looking to see if I can use a quote about crypto from him, but believe it or not, the Grandmaster of Singapore has not wrote a lot about crypto, but what he does write a lot about is complacency. And complacency as a killer of motivation. The fact that when things go really well, we tend to expect to get more for less hard work. And I think this is very relevant for this moment. You asked me what&#8217;s coming. So I think one of the most important things is that, and companies like ours really need to champion that. One of the most important things is we cannot take the risk of people forgetting how important it&#8217;s to build compliantly work with regulators.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now is the time to work harder to provide the best market integrity standards and invest more with hopefully all of the new profits that will come and invest more in building safely, not less. More specifically, we&#8217;ve been seeing regulators increasingly maturing their approach to the industry from a focus on AML preventing money laundering and financial terrorism, where of course I know so many of them use your incredible technology. But they&#8217;re increasingly maturing their approach to also look at market integrity and comprehensive programs. In the next two to five years having market surveillance in place and thoughtful market surveillance programs is going to be critical.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We as an industry need to constantly think, how does that translate into smart compliance programs? Requirements are one thing. How do we take the more clarity the regulator provided us and turn it into compliance programs using the right technologies like to Chainanalysis and Solidus that enable the merits, but mitigate the risks. Specifically I think there&#8217;s going to be a lot of very interesting conversations on this cross market surveillance piece because ultimately over time you&#8217;re seeing markets like Europe, which is already cross-border. There&#8217;s a lot of potential to understanding how trading an individual centralized exchanges corresponds with one another and with the on chain market, which is also expected to grow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then beyond that, I&#8217;ll just say the classic things that I think we&#8217;re all thinking about. I&#8217;m already seeing a lot of institutional adoption. I think we&#8217;re going to be seeing really interesting institutional buying into products like staking, into products like real-world assets. And there are a lot of questions that we are thinking about as I know you are, and I know regulators are in terms of how do we in those contexts as well mitigate the risks in order to enable the potential. So it was a bit of a kitchen sink answer, but I hope that it makes sense. Most importantly, now&#8217;s the time to work harder to enable compliance, safe and regulated services not less hard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I love that perspective. That&#8217;s a terrific place to finish the conversation Chen this has been amazing and I hope to see you in person soon. We can continue the conversation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chen:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hopefully at Lynx. I hope I&#8217;m not dating this episode, but Lynx is coming up. Can&#8217;t wait to see you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will be there as will a few thousand of our closest friends, so drinks on me. We&#8217;ll see you soon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chen:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Counting on it. Thank you so much for having me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, absolutely.</span></p>

<title>What FATF’s Report on Recommendation 15 Means for Regulators &amp; Private Sector</title>
<link>https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/fatf-r-15-update/</link>
<guid>https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/fatf-r-15-update/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章首先介绍了FATF发布的关于虚拟资产和VASP的实施情况报告的目的和内容，重点强调全球合作防止洗钱和恐怖融资。报告发现58个国家中有许多未充分实施FATF的R.15建议。此外，文章还强调了对国家和私营部门的影响，包括政策制定者和公司。最后，文章指出这些信息对政府、公共部门以及私有部门都有重要意义，并提供了Chainalysis支持相关国家和公司的方法。 <div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On March 28, 2024, the global money laundering and terrorist financing watchdog, Financial Action Task Force (FATF), published a </span><a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/content/fatf-gafi/en/publications/Virtualassets/VACG-Snapshot-Jurisdictions.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">table</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> setting out the implementation status of FATF standards on virtual assets and virtual asset service providers (VASPs) — also known as Recommendation 15 — by its </span><a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/the-fatf/who-we-are.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">38 FATF members</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and 20 additional jurisdictions with “</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">materially important VASP activity</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">”. Previous FATF reports have found, most recently in </span><a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/content/fatf-gafi/en/publications/Fatfrecommendations/targeted-update-virtual-assets-vasps-2023.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2023</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, material delays in fully implementing R.15. This table aims to shine additional light on implementation efforts while supporting jurisdictions in regulating and supervising VASPs for AML/CFT purposes, and encouraging jurisdictions with materially important VASP activity to fully implement R.15 in a timely manner. Below we explore the purpose of this report, discuss the findings and conclude what the impact of it on countries and VASPs might be. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chainalysis is honored to have actively contributed its expertise to the development of this report and is proud of its continued support of FATF’s important work to create a global level-playing field for AML/CFT obligations to reduce opportunities for criminals to abuse the crypto sector. </span></p>
<h2><b>What is the purpose of this report and what does it cover?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As virtual assets are inherently borderless, regulatory efforts need to be coordinated globally to avoid gaps and loopholes in AML/CFT regulation and supervision of VASPs which can have negative implications across the globe. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In October 2018, FATF first strengthened Recommendation 15 (R.15) to establish AML/CFT rules addressing virtual assets and VASPs directly (including customer due diligence (CDD) and travel rule obligations). However, FATF Recommendations require adoption into national legislation and sa preceding</span><a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/content/fatf-gafi/en/publications/Fatfrecommendations/targeted-update-virtual-assets-vasps-2023.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> FATF report in 2023</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> revealed that 75% of the 98 assessed jurisdictions either demonstrated only partial compliance or were non-compliant with R.15.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By issuing this report concerning the status of implementation of R.15, FATF reiterates its emphasis on how critical it is for governments to meet their commitments to implement the AML/CFT standard for the virtual asset sector in order to effectively tackle money laundering and terrorism financing nationally and globally. The report further aims to enable the FATF network to best support individual jurisdictions in regulating and supervising VASPs for AML/CFT purposes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FATF explicitly clarifies that the list of 58 jurisdictions does not indicate any assessment on the current state of their implementation of R.15 nor the overall AML/CFT frameworks. The list is based on the </span><a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/the-fatf/who-we-are.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">38 FATF members</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who are encouraged to take a leading position on AML/CFT frameworks in the virtual asset space, and additional 20 jurisdictions based on virtual asset trading volumes (hosting VASPs responsible for at least 0.25% of global virtual asset trading volume) and/or a virtual asset user bases exceeding 1 million. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to the 38 FATF members, the report identifies a further 20 jurisdictions as having  materially important virtual asset activity: Bahamas, Cayman Islands, Colombia, Cyprus, Egypt, Estonia, Gibraltar, Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Malta, Nigeria, Philippines, Poland, Seychelles, Thailand, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, Venezuela, Vietnam, Virgin Islands (British).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, the information in this FATF report does not replicate or replace a mutual evaluation or follow-up assessment of the jurisdiction’s compliance with R.15. It also only focuses on implementation of the AML standards, and does not consider any broader regulatory framework, for example covering prudential, market integrity or consumer protection requirements. </span></p>
<h2><b>What are the report’s findings? </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report’s table represents the findings of 58 jurisdictions’ self-reported surveys and additional basic evidence submitted to support these responses (as of the time of the update from January to March 2024): </span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>100% (58)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have either conducted or are in the process of conducting a risk assessment covering virtual assets and VASPs activity (</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in progress: Australia, Finland, Greece, Malaysia, Portugal)</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>9% </b><b><i>(5) </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">have or are in the process of explicitly prohibiting virtual assets and VASP activity </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(China, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and in progress: Seychelles, Indonesia) </span></i></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b><i>17% (10) </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">have not yet established a regulatory framework to require VASPs to register or license and apply AML/CFT measures </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Vietnam, New Zealand; in progress: Türkiye, Argentina, Colombia; alongside the five above jurisdiction which have or are in the process of explicitly prohibiting virtual assets and VASP activity) </span></i></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b><i>22% (13) </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">have not yet registered or licensed a VASP in practice </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Colombia, New Zealand, Türkiye, Ukraine, Vietnam, China, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Seychelles; in progress: Nigeria)</span></i></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b><i>15 % (9) </i></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">have not yet conducted a supervisory inspection or included VASPs in their current inspection plan </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Argentina, Colombia, China, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Ukraine, Vietnam; in progress: the Netherlands, the Virgin Islands (British)) </span></i></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>28% (16)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have not yet taken enforcement action or other supervisory action against VASPs </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Argentina, Brazil, China, Finland, Iceland, Ireland, Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Spain, Ukraine, Vietnam; in progress: Canada, Indonesia, Virgin Islands (British))</span></i></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>33% (19)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have not yet passed or enacted the travel rule for VASPs </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">(Australia, China, Egypt, Iceland, Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Ukraine, Vietnam; in progress: Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Malta, Mexico, Norway, New Zealand, Türkiye, Thailand, Seychelles)</span></i></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally to the above findings on the current status of implementation of R.15, the report also identifies each jurisdiction’s rating for R.15 compliance, w</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">hen this has already been assessed as part of a mutual evaluation prior to this updated report. These specific R.15 compliance ratings therefore reflect the status of the date of the mutual assessment (which is indicated in brackets, ranging from 2020 to 2024) rather than the date of this updated report</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is noteworthy that Bahamas is the only jurisdiction in this list of 58 jurisdictions deemed fully compliant with R.15, based on its mutual evaluation in 2022. Please note that 13 jurisdictions have not yet been evaluated with regards to the revised R.15 in a mutual evaluation at all. . </span></p>
<h2><b>What does this mean for the crypto sector? </b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FATF’s table is a very helpful reference guide for both policy makers in the public and companies in the private sector to quickly understand the status of R.15 implementation in individual jurisdictions. It can also act as a rough benchmarking tool, including on how effective individual frameworks in these 58 jurisdictions are.  </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The report highlights that still more work is required to implement FATF’s R.15 and achieve a global level-playing field in AML/CFT obligations for virtual assets and VASPs, particularly in the area of the travel rule implementation.</span></p>
<h2><b>What does this mean for countries and the public sector?</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FATF continues to encourage jurisdictions to prioritize the implementation of the FATF standards for virtual assets based on their individual risks as assessed in their National Risk Assessment. Governments should note that these assessments should incorporate quantitative as well as qualitative (on-chain) information. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For jurisdictions that are in the process of fully implementing R.15 , this table can act as an incentive to allocate further resources and ensure broader political support for national implementation efforts to tackle money laundering and terrorist financing  The report also highlights the component elements of effective implementation,  thereby highlighting the areas of improvement a jurisdiction should focus its efforts on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jurisdictions should also bear in mind that if appropriate steps towards regulating (or banning) VASPs  -such as effectively implemented licensing or registration requirements &#8211; have not been taken, nationally established VASPs might be considered as higher risk by third country VASPs and financial institutions (subject to their own ML/TF risk assessment &#8211; see also FATF’s </span><a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/content/dam/fatf-gafi/guidance/Updated-Guidance-VA-VASP.pdf.coredownload.inline"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Updated 2021 Guidance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">). This could result in a significant disadvantage to a jurisdiction’s entire virtual asset sector in a global context and ultimately impact a jurisdiction’s assessment of compliance with FATF Recommendations and the effectiveness of its wider AML/CFT framework (as part of </span><a href="https://www.fatf-gafi.org/en/calendars/assessments.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mutual Evaluations</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">).</span></p>
<h2><b>What does this mean for companies?</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">FATF’s table is a welcome reference tool for private companies in this sector to quickly learn about a jurisdiction’s requirements regarding licensing and registration as well as travel rule obligations. It can also be part of the considerations regarding jurisdictional risk when VASPs formulate and calibrate their AML/CFT risk assessment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As countries come under more pressure to quickly implement R.15, obligations on VASPs, like exchanges, brokers and custodians, will continue to rise. With the heightened attention on this sector and increasing regulatory obligations for VASPs globally, it might not be sufficient to simply have access to risk monitoring and mitigating tools (such as blockchain analytics tools), regulators and supervisors are more likely to ascertain that these tools are actively used to monitor and mitigate risk and appropriately inform a VASP’s decision making.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lastly, VASPs located in non-compliant jurisdictions might face the issue of being regarded as higher risk counterparties, ultimately impacting their partnership and commercial abilities globally.  </span></p>

<title>Intellectual Property Infringement: Crypto Used in Sales for Illicit Streaming Services and Counterfeit Pharmaceuticals</title>
<link>https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/crypto-intellectual-property-infringement-streaming-pharmaceuticals/</link>
<guid>https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/crypto-intellectual-property-infringement-streaming-pharmaceuticals/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。文章讨论了加密货币如何被恶意行为利用，特别是在侵犯知识产权以及非法流媒体和制药业中的作用。恶意行为者通过加密货币在非法流媒体服务和在线制药商中进行交易，给正版公司和消费者造成了严重损害。文章还分享了一个实例研究，介绍了如何利用区块链分析监控这些不当活动。随着加密货币在世界经济中发展，法律执法机构需要对这些活动进行持续监测。 <div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As with all new technologies, malicious actors have found ways to exploit cryptocurrency, despite its transparency and traceability. These actors presumably believe that crypto’s benefits — namely, the ability to transact instantaneously and across borders — outweigh the heightened risks of law enforcement detection. The most obvious examples are </span><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/ransomware-2024/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ransomware</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/darknet-revenue-2023/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">darknet markets</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which are inherently and deeply tied to cryptocurrency in that they more or less require crypto payments’ unique lack of middlemen in order to exist. However, as cryptocurrency grows and becomes more entwined with the world economy, we’re seeing it crop up in all forms of crime — even those that aren’t “crypto native” or even, in some cases, thought of as related to cybercrime, such as with </span><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/cryptocurrency-fentanyl-analysis-2023/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">conventional drug trafficking</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One example of this is cryptocurrency’s role in improper intellectual property (IP) use. Many illicit actors now accept crypto in exchange for IP-infringing products and services, such as pirated movies and infringing prescription medications, causing significant harm to the brands of authentic companies and their consumers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Below, we’ll explore how crypto may be facilitating IP infringement in the entertainment industry and pharmaceutical industries, and how law enforcement can monitor on-chain transactions executed by the operators of these offending websites. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cryptocurrency’s role in illicit streaming services</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the past few years, streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Disney+ have attracted audiences from around the world due to the creation of regular, original content. When the streaming service model emerged, it opened access to hundreds — if not thousands — of movies and television shows for a small monthly fee. Consequently, many entertainment companies assumed it would reduce piracy and improve branding through stronger IP protection. Unfortunately, </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2021/oct/02/streaming-was-supposed-to-stop-piracy-now-it-is-easier-than-ever"><span style="font-weight: 400;">piracy is still common</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> due to the ease of downloading and viewing videos on offending websites, and has led to substantial losses for legitimate entertainment companies. </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.ncprotection.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nordic Content Protection</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (NCP), a television anti-piracy non-profit and one of our partners, has been monitoring streaming piracy to determine its global scale and how law enforcement can help protect legitimate content. NCP provided us with hundreds of crypto addresses they unearthed during their investigations into illicit streaming. We analyzed the activities of these addresses, in addition to those of illicit streaming addresses we already had, and determined that total inflows were approximately $24 million between 2019 and 2023.</span></p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-13536 size-large" height="907" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/streaming-inflows-1500x907.png" width="1500" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Michael Lund, Security Manager of NCP, suspects that this activity extends far beyond the addresses provided and Europe in general. “Television piracy is a global challenge and a significant threat in Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and the Americas,” he explained. “We estimate that the number of users of illicit streaming services is in the hundreds of millions, leading to billions in lost revenue for legitimate services. This, in effect, leads to less tax revenue, fewer jobs, and poorer quality of content.” Indeed, a report by the </span><a href="https://www.aapa.eu/illicit-iptv-in-europe-an-aapa-economic-report"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Audiovisual Anti-Piracy Alliance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (AAPA) revealed that legal Pay-T.V. providers in Europe lost €3.21 billion in revenue in 2021 to illegal IPTV, an illegitimate “industry” that includes several providers of illicit streaming to an estimated 17 million subscribers across Europe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lund added that many individuals and groups involved in IP infringement may also be involved in other serious crimes, such as organized money laundering. “In money laundering cases, we have seen that illicit revenue generated from the sale of illegal IPTV has been laundered through fake online hosting and IT services companies and through the purchase of fast food restaurants and traditional investments in real estate development.” </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many malicious actors accept crypto for counterfeit medical products listed on illicit pharmaceutical shop websites</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the World Health Organization, </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10184969/#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20WHO%2C%20around,year%20because%20of%20fake%20medications"><span style="font-weight: 400;">approximately 50%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of drugs sold on online pharmacies are counterfeit. Typically, organized criminal groups acquire and package illicit medicines and then list them on online pharmaceutical shops. These products appear to be legitimate prescription medications, thus infringing on trademarks and other IP of major pharmaceutical companies, and enabling illicit actors to target unsuspecting customers and reap financial rewards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many pharmaceutical shops complicit in the sales of counterfeit medicines accept payment in fiat, whereas some accept both fiat and crypto, as shown in the screenshot below of a merchant accepting Bitcoin. </span></p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-13538 size-large" height="575" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/pharma-shop-accepting-bitcoin-1500x575.png" width="1500" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In many cases, it is unclear whether pharmaceutical shops like the one above are selling legitimate products diverted from the legal supply chain or generic medical products branded as legitimate. Regardless, actors selling these products in exchange for crypto are harming the IP rights of legitimate pharmaceutical companies. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, how can law enforcement and IP owners monitor this activity? The case study below illustrates one way on-chain analysis can be used to retrace the steps of those operating crypto addresses associated with these pharmaceutical shops. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Case study: Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/medicines-and-healthcare-products-regulatory-agency"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (MHRA) is an organization based in the United Kingdom, committed to maintaining safety of medicines and medical devices. Due to the increase of illicit pharmaceutical shops accepting crypto, MHRA has been closely monitoring the on-chain activity of certain shops, often by executing test transactions to establish the typical flow of funds after customers make purchases. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The following </span><a href="http://reactor.chainalysis.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chainalysis Reactor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> graph illustrates an example of what these test transactions look like on-chain. On the left, MHRA made four test purchases in crypto related to counterfeit medical products sold on an online pharmaceutical shop — this provided them with addresses operated by the actors running the shop. Once these actors received MHRA’s payments, they transferred the funds to several intermediary addresses. Eventually, the funds reached a mainstream exchange, which likely represents the cash-out point for the operator of the online pharmacy. The intermediary addresses also received funds from addresses that behave in the same fashion as MHRA’s target and are likely other services that are a part of the same malicious group. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Upon completion of these test transactions, MHRA discovered that the actors had transferred millions of dollars to the same mainstream exchange, some — but not all — of which likely came from the sale of illicit medicines. MHRA then conducted inquiries with the exchange, learning that a small portion of the transferred funds was still held at the exchange. MHRA concluded by freezing the funds and sharing information with additional regulatory agencies. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monitoring on-chain activity across all industries</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our exploration of crypto and IP infringement illustrate how crypto is becoming a part of the financial infrastructure for many different types of illicit activities. Fortunately, companies in any industry may be able to leverage technologies that monitor on-chain activity, such as Chainalysis’s product suite, to determine the extent of IP infringement facilitated by crypto and whether this activity is also linked to other suspicious conduct. </span></p>

<title>Darknet market revenues rise in 2023 as markets develop role specialization</title>
<link>https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/darknet-revenue-2023/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。2023年，暗网市场和欺诈商店的收入略有增长，但仍未恢复到2022年Hydra市场关闭前的水平。各大市场如Mega Darknet Market和Kraken Market在暗网市场生态系统中处于领先地位。暗网市场和欺诈商店在整合加密支付处理器以提高运营效率和安全性方面取得进展。独特服务以及对不同犯罪类型的专业化使暗网市场在2023年呈现碎片化趋势。 Genesis Market是一家欺诈商店，通过使用支付处理器UAPS提高效率。荷兰国家警察与国际合作打击Genesis Market，揭示了其盗取受害者身份的操作方式。总体而言，暗网市场表现出复苏迹象，但尚未达到Hydra市场关闭前的收入水平。 <div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Darknet markets were one of two categories of crypto crime that saw revenues rise in 2023. In total, darknet markets and fraud shops received $1.7 billion last year, a rebound from 2022 — the year that saw the sizable </span><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/hydra-garantex-ofac-sanctions-russia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hydra Marketplace close</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The ensuing </span><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/how-darknet-markets-fought-for-users-in-wake-of-hydra-collapse-2022/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">war for darknet market dominance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that began in 2022 continued into 2023, but no other market has since matched Hydra’s financial success. We’ll discuss theories as to why, and other darknet market trends here. </span></p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13461" height="502" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/darknet-market-and-fraud-shop-revenue-800x502.png" width="800" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chart above shows that, while values haven’t risen back to 2021 levels, darknet market revenue has slightly rebounded since Hydra’s closure in 2022. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">The continuing battle for darknet market dominance</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In terms of individual market success, Mega Darknet Market led the pack with over half a billion in crypto inflows, and Kraken Market (not to be confused with the popular cryptocurrency exchange Kraken) in particular gained prominence among Russian darknet markets, as shown below. Blacksprut and OMG!OMG!, markets that jockeyed for position in the wake of Hydra’s closure, are still top players in the darknet market ecosystem.</span></p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13464" height="495" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/10-ten-dnm-800x495.png" width="800" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In recent years, some darknet markets and fraud shops have been integrating crypto payment processors on their websites via APIs, possibly as a way to improve operational efficiency and increase security. Essentially, these payment processors provide a white label service for darknet markets and fraud shops, and a seamless checkout experience for those services’ customers. UAPS, shown in the chart above, is one such example of a payment processor that many fraud shops, including the OFAC-designated </span><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/genesis-market-fraud-shop-shutdown-sanction/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Genesis Market</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, used in 2023. The value received by UAPS in this chart includes payments sent to multiple fraud shops using the service as a payment processor. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another newer trend: Darknet markets that employed brazen marketing tactics in 2022 appeared to gain a competitive edge in 2023. Take Kraken Market for instance, which opened in 2022 and </span><a href="https://lenta.ru/articles/2023/01/13/darkpr/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">bills itself as Hydra’s successor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As a way to tease its impending launch, in the fall of 2022, Kraken Market employed an immersive 3D billboard in Moscow containing an animated kraken. </span></p>
<p><img alt="Kraken Market’s immersive 3D billboard in Moscow." class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13438" height="313" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/kraken-market-3d-billboard.png" width="595" /><i>Kraken Market’s immersive 3D billboard in Moscow. Source: </i><a href="https://lenta.ru/articles/2023/01/13/darkpr/"><i>Lenta.ru</i></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And, perhaps the most aggressive marketing stunt the darknet market ecosystem has seen yet, in December of that year, Kraken Market </span><a href="https://lenta.ru/articles/2023/01/13/darkpr/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">wrapped a bus in an advertisement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that included a QR code for the market’s website. The bus blocked two traffic lanes on a road near Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs before security forces removed it an hour later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a smaller scale, Mega Darknet Market placed a few ads with QR codes in public places like Moscow subway trains. While tactics like these may have helped boost revenue for both markets, again, they have yet to match Hydra’s sizable financial success.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Darknet market services show fragmentation in 2023</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Throughout the history of the darknet market ecosystem, at different turns one marketplace has typically played the dominant role. The last several years’ examples include Silk Road, AlphaBay, Wall Street Market, and Hydra, most recently. Historically, as law enforcement closed each dominant marketplace, a new leader emerged. We can see this pattern on the chart below, which shows the level of market share controlled by the dominant market of each epoch. The recovery pattern is fairly consistent until the Hydra Marketplace closure, after which no dominant darknet market emerged.</span></p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13457" height="648" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/top-market-share-surrounding-major-darknet-market-closures-2013-2023-1-800x648.png" width="800" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Darknet market role specialization provides one possible explanation as to why the ecosystem has yet to see a dominant player. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Darknet markets differentiate themselves by unique service offering</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Historically, darknet markets have been heavily associated with illicit drug trade, a reputation that </span><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/silk-road-doj-seizure-november-2020/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Silk Road</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> played a significant role in creating. However, over the years some markets have evolved beyond this capacity to develop a robust catalog of illicit services like money laundering, fiat offramping, and products that enable cybercriminal activities like ransomware and malware attacks. One such sophisticated darknet market, </span><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/hydra-garantex-ofac-sanctions-russia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hydra</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, offered all that and more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By contrast, it appears today’s darknet markets largely serve specific niches and have individually organized themselves into unique criminal functions, which we determined when examining the origin points for darknet market inflows last year. As such, the chart below illustrates darknet market share by crime type based on the following categories:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Cybercriminal enablement</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Darknet market services related to ransomware, malware, stolen funds, and other types of cybercrime. Enablement could include </span><a href="https://www.fortinet.com/resources/cyberglossary/rootkit"><span style="font-weight: 400;">root kits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, access to personally identifiable information (PII), and potentially, offramping for stolen funds.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Drug sourcing and supply</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Online pharmacies or darknet markets that sell drugs to vendors on other darknet markets.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Other illicit laundering/buying</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Transfers made to darknet markets for the purpose of obfuscating on-chain activity or purchasing illegal products.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Rest of world drug exchange</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Drug purchases made on darknet markets serving a global customer base, as opposed to primarily a Western or Russian customer base.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Russian-serving drug exchange</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Drug purchases made on darknet markets by customers based in Russia.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Western-facing drug exchange</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Drug purchases made on darknet markets by customers generally based in the United States and Western Europe.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13449" height="646" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/dominant-darknet-markets-by-criminal-function-in-2023-800x646.png" width="800" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The categorization in the chart above is based on origin points. Cybercrime enablement represents flows from ransomware, stolen funds, malware, or fraud shops to darknet markets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Drug-related revenue comes from sources like exchanges. Western drug flows in particular come from US-domiciled exchanges and trace flows from those to darknet markets. The entity “DNM Aggregator” that appears within each category refers to a service we’ve identified as being in control of multiple, disparate darknet markets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When it comes to cybercriminal enablement, markets like Kraken Market, the DNM Aggregator, and Exploit.in are go-to services, providing bad actors with tools to carry out ransomware attacks, hacks, and more. Kraken Market also captured the largest share of transfers potentially sent for the purpose of obfuscating funds, as well as buying illegal products. In addition to that activity, markets like these host vendors that advertise their own cashout or swapping services, resulting in tens of millions of dollars in laundered funds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mega Darknet Market is the dominant drug supply source for drug vendors on other darknet sites, holding a 63.4% share of that market. When looking at darknet drug markets serving Russia-based customers, Kraken Market captured 30.9% of market share, with Blacksprut and Mega Darknet markets closely following. As for drug markets serving Western customers, ASAP Market held a 25.0% share, followed by Mega and Incognito. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Darknet market revenue based on drug-purchasing behaviors</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When looking at 2023 drug-purchasing habits for customers from exchanges primarily serving users in North America and Western Europe, the data indicate that just two markets played dominant roles across drug purchase types, while most captured smaller, fragmented shares of total revenue received. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are category definitions for the chart below. Keep in mind that these categories are based solely on purchase sizes, which we use to make assumptions about their likely purpose. </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Small retail</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Purchases of less than $100, likely made for personal consumption.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Large retail</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Purchases between $100 and $500, likely made for personal consumption.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Social supply</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Purchases between $500 and $1,000, which indicate customers may be sharing drugs with other third parties in social settings.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Potential wholesale</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Purchases over $1,000, more likely to be made by drug sellers and distributors.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13446" height="727" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/crypto-inflows-from-westerndomiciled-exchanges-to-darknet-markets-2023-800x727.png" width="800" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The chart above shows that ASAP and Mega Darknet markets led the large retail and wholesale segments respectively. Looking closer at ASAP Market inflows, it won some share of revenue across all drug purchase types, receiving 37.1% of social supply, 35.7% of large retail, 16.5% of small retail, and 13.5% of wholesale purchases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though Mega Darknet Market typically serves a Russian customer base, the drug revenue shown in the chart above likely came from customers based in Europe. Mega clearly dominated the realm of wholesale drug purchases, capturing 51.9% of that segment.</span></p>
<h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fentanyl sales in darknet markets</span></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite most darknet markets banning the sale of fentanyl in their terms of service, nearly all mainstream Western-facing markets have vendors that sell fentanyl-laced products. While it received a relatively small share of large retail purchases as shown in the previous chart, Abacus Market is one such example. Though many customers are concentrated in Australia, Abacus has vendors and customers around the world, including the United States. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Customer reviews found on the Abacus site indicate that some of its American vendors sell drug products laced with fentanyl. Additionally, vendors found on Abacus and many top Western-facing markets sell an analog of fentanyl called </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">a</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">-Methylfentanyl — colloquially known as &#8220;China White.” According to the </span><a href="https://www.hrpub.org/download/20150410/UJCM2-16903384.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Universal Journal of Clinical Medicine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, drug researchers believe that this analog is the product of contamination during important parts of the fentanyl synthesis process, and is sold for its powerful effects, which can be up to 300 times more potent than morphine. It has appeared in overdose deaths in recent years. </span></p>
<p><img alt="U.S.-based drug vendors on Abacus Market advertising a synthetic opioid called China White, which its customers can purchase using Bitcoin or Monero." class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13437" height="498" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/china-white-market-examples-800x498.png" width="800" /></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S.-based drug vendors on Abacus Market advertising a synthetic opioid called China White, which its customers can purchase using Bitcoin or Monero.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another darknet market known for facilitating fentanyl sales to the United States was Canada-based </span><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/decoding-darknet-markets/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">AlphaBay</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A once-sizable illicit enterprise that began in 2014, AlphaBay was closed by authorities in 2017 and then reopened in 2021. The last version of the market operated until February of 2023, and a month after that closure, a former AlphaBay vendor </span><a href="https://darknetlive.com/post/alphabay-fentanyl-vendor-narcoboss-guilty-of-ods-9b3f143e"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pled guilty</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to distributing fentanyl that caused fatal overdoses in Oregon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fentanyl and fentanyl-laced drugs also arrive in the United States through Latin America based cartels. U.S. customers predominantly purchase drugs from these groups that are known to have used crypto to source </span><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/cryptocurrency-fentanyl-analysis-2023/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fentanyl precursor chemicals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from </span><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/ofac-sanctions-china-fentanyl-october-2023/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">labs based in China</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The cartels then use those chemicals to manufacture fentanyl that is later sold in the U.S. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crime forums and markets specializing in cybercrime enablement</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much like with drug sales, a similar pattern of task differentiation emerged among darknet markets providing cybercriminal services. In the chart below, we see that the DNM Aggregator emerged as the clear leader among fraud shops enabling cybercrime, and Exploit.in and Kraken Market almost equally sold tools used to facilitate ransomware attacks. Kraken Market also received the largest share of stolen funds. As for cybercriminal administration, the category includes inflows from ransomware affiliate wallets. This includes purchases such as malicious software and supporting services which cybercriminals sometimes make using escrow services on crime forums.</span></p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13445" height="730" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/market-dominance-in-the-cybercrime-enablement-space-2023-800x730.png" width="800" /></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dutch National Police share depth and sophistication of Genesis Market identity theft operation</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fraud shops are vendors that typically operate on the dark web and facilitate the sale of stolen data and personally identifiable information (PII), which cybercriminals abuse in illicit activities like scamming, identity theft, and ransomware. One fraud shop that provided services like these, </span><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/genesis-market-fraud-shop-shutdown-sanction/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Genesis Market</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, saw its end last April after a coordinated, international law enforcement effort called Operation Cookie Monster closed it down, and OFAC sanctioned it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Though it’s common for fraud shops to operate on the dark web, Genesis Market was accessible on the clearnet via Google search, and simply required an invitation code to create an account. This ease of access attracted a new breed of criminals not typically associated with cybercrime. To them and others, Genesis sold forms of stolen PII like credentials for email and social media accounts, as well bank accounts and crypto service accounts, and in its lifetime received tens of millions of dollars in crypto, mostly Bitcoin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For a fraud shop, Genesis Market demonstrated an unusual level of sophistication by offering Impersonation-as-a-Service (IMPaaS), meaning robust “online fingerprints” of victims rather than just their credentials for individual services; Genesis’ IMPaaS packages included access to victims’ browser cookies, which allowed cybercriminals to circumvent two-factor authentication (2FA) and wreak havoc with victims’ accounts. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We spoke with Ruben van Well, Chief Inspector of Team Cybercrime Rotterdam from the Dutch National Police, to learn about their involvement in the Genesis Market case, and how the Genesis operation worked. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Genesis Market stole the identity of over 2 million victims worldwide</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2019, the FBI started its investigation into Genesis Market and enlisted other government agencies and law enforcement organizations across the world, working towards the </span><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/genesis-market-fraud-shop-shutdown-sanction/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">market’s closure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> on April 4, 2023. As part of the investigation, the Dutch National Police took the lead on cybercrime prevention, and Van Well shared his insight on the sophistication of the fraud shop’s operation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to gain control of victims’ computers, the malware Genesis Market employed used a legacy Bitcoin address to determine the command-and-control (C2) server, from which cybercriminals initiated remote access to infected devices.</span></p>
<p><img alt="The legacy Bitcoin address pivotal to the malware side of the Genesis operation" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13439" height="360" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/legacy-bitcoin-address-800x360.png" width="800" /></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The legacy Bitcoin address pivotal to the malware side of the Genesis operation</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The information-stealing malware package that Genesis Market used to exploit victims included a hidden Chromium-based browser plugin, made to look like a Google Drive plugin, which captured credentials stored in victims’ browsers.</span></p>
<p><img alt="Hidden browser plugin which captured credentials stored in victims’ browsers" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-13436" height="401" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/browser-plugin.png" width="772" /></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hidden browser plugin which captured credentials stored in victims’ browsers</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As it retrieved data from malware-infected computers, Genesis sold victims’ online footprints — which it called “bots” — on its market. Each bot represented a compromised computer or device and the credentials associated with its owner. While it operated, Genesis Market sold </span><a href="https://www.computest.nl/en/knowledge-platform/blog/arrests-worldwide-genesis-market-for-online-identity-fraud/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">1.6 million</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> bots. On the fraud shop’s website, cybercriminals could comb through hundreds of thousands of bots on its robust user interface (UI), filtering results by criteria like country or searching for credentials tied to a particular domain name. The UI showed how many logins and what accounts each bot contained; the more logins provided, the more expensive the bot, especially when it included bank or crypto account credentials. The UI also showed when the victim’s device was infected by the malware and when it was last updated, and Genesis provided customers with a wiki on how to abuse victims’ credentials.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img alt="A page on the former Genesis Market showing bots (i.e., victims’ profiles) for sale." class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13440" height="512" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/genesis-market-screenshot-800x512.png" width="800" /></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of its most insidious innovations — the Genesium browser — was a browser plugin that Genesis built for its customers to use. Any time the information-stealing malware detected changes to a victim’s passwords or a new account, it would update the Genesium browser with the latest credentials. In addition to stealing logins, the malware scraped browser cookies, granting cybercriminals control over session cookies which helped them mimic victims’ computers. Since many website cookies persist for 30 days, criminals were often able to evade 2FA processes. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This made Genesis Market extremely dangerous because they had their hands on a lot of credentials but they could also impersonate the victim online,” says Van Well. “We saw bank accounts and crypto wallets being cleared, as well as identity being misused to open new accounts. We saw goods being bought from online shops, and a variety of cybercrime, which was all related to Genesis Market.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In one particularly devastating case, a man lost his entire $80,000 pension. Using his credentials, cybercriminals committed a variety of online fraud activity over the course of six months. Given the tooling’s ability to capture new password updates, the perpetrators could easily maintain control over his accounts, and they opened bank accounts in his name and had his physical mail sent to an address where they could receive it.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">How the Dutch National Police helped Genesis Market victims</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to investigating individual incidents of crime against Dutch citizens, the Dutch National Police worked with public and private sector partners to investigate the </span><a href="https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/infection-chain/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">infection chain</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — the path of distribution and installation — for the information-stealing malware that enabled Genesis Market to steal victims’ identities. The results of that investigation were published in a report called </span><a href="https://sector7.computest.nl/post/2023-04-technical-analysis-genesis-market/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Technical analysis of the Genesis Market</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Van Well explained that his organization doesn’t typically share so much detailed technical information around investigations, but it felt imperative to provide these details to law enforcement and tech companies around the world to help them fight future cybercrimes. Though Genesis Market domains and servers were seized and antivirus programs have been updated, cybercriminals have already rebuilt illicit services like these.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To help Genesis Market victims and prevent future crimes, the Dutch Police created a </span><a href="https://www.politie.nl/en/information/checkyourhack.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Check your hack</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tool that lets victims see if their credentials were sold or for sale on Genesis Market. The tool is still available today, and interested parties simply need to enter their email address to place an inquiry. If the address is in one of the cybercrime datasets, the person will receive an email that includes personalized instructions on how to clean up their computer and make it safe again. In the first 24 hours of launching Check your hack, two million people took advantage of the service. So far, five million people have used the tool, and over 13,000 victims have been notified that their computer was infected, and received instructions to help them make their device safe again. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As far as financial recourse for victims, some banks and insurance companies have provided payouts and will include those funds as damages in lawsuits against Genesis Market cybercriminals. As for Genesis Market cybercriminals located in the Netherlands, three have already been convicted and received prison sentences considered severe for that jurisdiction. The first received 24 months and the second, four years. The third convicted cybercriminal — the biggest Dutch user and the number 10 user worldwide — received a four-year sentence.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fraud shops use payment processor to boost efficiency</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2023, Chainalysis discovered that some popular fraud shops rely on payment processors as a way to reduce their own costs, add efficiency to their operations, and perhaps add a layer of security to transactions. Genesis Market extensively used a payment processor called UAPS, so much that the processor’s average inflows fell by 25.7% after Genesis closed last April. Regardless, UAPS remains a key provider of payment infrastructure to top fraud shops.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Darknet market revenues rose slightly, but have yet to regain Hydra Marketplace highs</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the darknet market ecosystem showed signs of recovery in 2023, it has yet to return to the revenues it experienced before the Hydra Marketplace closure in 2022, given the financial success of that operation. It’s noteworthy that, despite some unusual marketing efforts, no other darknet market has since assumed Hydra’s mantle of being the one-stop-shop for illicit products and services. Though the sanctioning and closure of fraud shop Genesis Market occurred last year, there were no other sanction events for the darknet market ecosystem, or major market takedowns. We’ll continue monitoring darknet market trends in 2024, and are curious to see what new tactics markets and fraud shops may employ to find more customers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“This relationship allows Huron to seamlessly assist our clients in the digital asset space, from investigations to advisory engagements, service areas where we are seeing increased demand,” said </span><b>Timothy Martin, managing director, leading the disputes and investigations team at Huron. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>

<title>OFAC and OFSI Sanction Social Media News Outlet Gaza Now for Hamas Fundraising in Wake of October 7 Attacks</title>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。2024年3月27日，美国和英国对两名个人和三个实体进行了制裁，因为他们在10月7日对以色列发动袭击后为哈马斯筹集资金。其中包括位于加沙的社交媒体新闻机构Gaza Now，主管Mustafa Ayash，以及两家伦敦公司Al-Qureshi Executives和Aakhirah Limited。这些实体在使用加密货币进行筹款时受到制裁。文章详细介绍了Gaza Now对哈马斯的支持和加密货币筹款活动，同时提供了Gaza Now的加密货币地址和交易历史分析。银行交易揭示了大部分资金来自主流交易所，同时还有少量来自伊朗的交易所和加沙的货币服务业务。最后，文章强调了打击恐怖主义融资的重要性。文章强调这些信息是积极的。 <div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On March 27, 2024, the </span><a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2213"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and the </span><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/66040453e8c4420011220329/Counter-Terrorism__Domestic_.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UK’s Office of Foreign Sanctions Implementation (OFSI)</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> sanctioned two individuals and three entities for their role in raising money for Hamas following the October 7 attacks against Israel. Those individuals and entities are:</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Gaza Now</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a social media news outlet based in Gaza that has posted pro-Hamas content and solicited donations for Hamas, including via cryptocurrency</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Mustafa Ayash</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the founder and director of Gaza Now</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Al-Qureshi Executives</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><b>Aakhirah Limited</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, two London-based businesses that sent money to Gaza Now and promoted Gaza Now as a partner in a joint fundraising effort for Hamas</span></li>
<li><b>Aozma Sultana</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the director of Al-Qureshi Executives and Aakhirah Limited</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the case of Gaza Now, OFAC and OFSI included in their designations several cryptocurrency addresses controlled by the media outlet, which have been used in crypto donation campaigns. In total, those addresses have received nearly $4.5 million in cryptocurrency. Below, we’ll share those addresses and an analysis of Gaza Now’s pro-Hamas activity and crypto transaction history. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gaza Now’s support for Hamas and crypto fundraising</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gaza Now is a social media news outlet with millions of followers across platforms like Instagram, Twitter, and most of all, Telegram. Following October 7, Gaza Now increased its online profile and attracted followers by posting highly graphic videos of the attacks and subsequent fighting in Gaza (for this reason we recommend readers not visit Gaza Now’s social media channels). A </span><a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/hamas-executes-3-members-accused-of-killing-terror-leader/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2017 article</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Times of Israel</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> highlights the controversy Gaza Now’s broadcasts of violent content, such as the livestream of an execution, has caused in the past.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gaza Now makes no secret of its support for terrorist organizations. In the screenshot of its Telegram channel below, for instance, the outlet expresses praise for the Hamas-aligned Al-Aqsa Martyrs&#8217; Brigades.</span></p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_13266" style="width: 800px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-13266 size-medium" height="661" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/gn-tg-1-800x661.png" width="800" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-13266">Note: Content in this screenshot has been translated from its original language into English.</figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gaza Now had long promoted crypto donation campaigns, and some of the addresses highlighted in sanctions designations today began receiving funds in 2021. However, Gaza Now ramped up these efforts after October 7, frequently changing addresses as a result of increased scrutiny following the attacks and the channel’s subsequent growth in followers Gaza Now regularly posted and then deleted posts asking for donations and switched between several different cryptocurrencies as part of these efforts. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the screenshot below, Gaza Now provides donation options for both crypto and fiat, and also references Aakhirah Limited, which was also sanctioned by OFAC concurrently with Gaza Now.</span></p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_13267" style="width: 716px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-13267 size-full" height="508" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/gn-tg-addy.png" width="716" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-13267">Note: Content in this screenshot has been translated from its original language into English.</figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can see Gaza Now’s crypto fundraising and subsequent transactions on the blockchain as well. The addresses highlighted in the sanctions designations include both personal wallet addresses and addresses hosted at exchanges. First, we’ll look at some of the inflows to Gaza Now’s mainstream exchange deposit addresses on the </span><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/chainalysis-reactor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chainalysis Reactor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> graph below. These account for the vast majority of Gaza Now’s total inflows, having received a total of over $4.4 million in cryptocurrency.</span></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-13268" height="701" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/gazanow-deposit-addresses-final-800x701.png" width="800" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Inflows have come primarily from mainstream exchanges, but as we show on the graph above, the addresses have also received funds from three wallets previously targeted in an NBCTF seizure, as well as from an exchange based in Iran and a money services business (MSB) based in Gaza.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gaza Now’s personal wallets, on the other hand, have received just over $40,000 in inflows across a variety of cryptocurrencies.</span></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-13269" height="759" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/gaza-pws-reactor-final-800x759.png" width="800" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of those funds have come from mainstream exchanges, but as we see above, funds have also come in from instant exchanges, mixers, and smart contracts, suggesting that some donors took extra steps to obfuscate their activity. On the outflows side, these addresses have sent cryptocurrency primarily to nested services at mainstream exchanges, presumably to be converted into cash.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, Gaza Now’s incoming transactions have come in a wide range of sizes, with most being under $10,000.</span></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-13273" height="385" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/gn-transfer-sizes-800x385.png" width="800" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s possible that the larger transfers have been due to internal movements of funds by Gaza Now or its collaborators, rather than from donations. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gaza Now cryptocurrency addresses identified by OFAC</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OFAC and OFSI highlighted the following cryptocurrency addresses in its designations of Gaza Now:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TH96tFMn8KGiYSLiwcV3E2UiaJc8jmcbz3</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TGJVc32ig2u8tQsYMLE7KXHT5NDQroaVNU</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TXEsK1sEsKjZ1xtHitnyAAoqw3WLdYdRNW</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">0xE950DC316b836e4EeFb8308bf32Bf7C72a1358FF</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">0x21B8d56BDA776bbE68655A16895afd96F5534feD</span></li>

</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of these addresses are now attributed as belonging to a sanctioned entity in all Chainalysis products.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Combatting terrorism financing is vital</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Terrorism financing via cryptocurrency is a complex problem. Sanctions designations and the highlighting of specific addresses, as seen in this action, is a critical step toward fighting this activity, and toward </span><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/cryptocurrency-terrorism-financing-accuracy-check/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">understanding its true scope</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> so that the industry can respond as effectively as possible.</span></p>

<h2><b>Transcript</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So Ian, 100 episodes in podcasting is huge. It&#8217;s a huge accomplishment. As the host, the audience doesn&#8217;t really get the chance to get under the hood of what you&#8217;ve been up to and your career and then what you spend your time working on. So are you ready to be in the hot seat?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Couldn&#8217;t be more excited for this episode, Kim. I love the reversal of roles here. You getting to take the chair as the host, although I don&#8217;t know I&#8217;m ready for all these questions, but I just want to thank everybody who contributed the podcast over the first 100 episodes. We&#8217;ve had incredible guests, but there&#8217;s also a ton of behind-the-scenes people. We couldn&#8217;t have put this together obviously without Stephen Sargeant and the team at Airdropd. They&#8217;ve been here for every episode along the way, and then a ton of our Chainalysis colleagues who help edit the video promos that people see on social media, the posts that go up on the blog, it&#8217;s a tremendous team effort. Everybody gets to see my face when they download the podcast episode, but there&#8217;s a lot of work that happens behind the scenes to make these good. So thank you to everybody.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will say also when I talk to people, they always comment about how you&#8217;re a very good podcast host, you ask good questions. You make everyone feel comfortable. You&#8217;re like a natural at it. So we&#8217;ve been lucky to have you, too, hosting the podcast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s a funny story, actually, I&#8217;ll share it here. So about a little over two years ago, the team came to me and said, &#8220;Hey, Ian, we think we need a podcast.&#8221; My initial reaction was, &#8220;Look, there&#8217;s a billion crypto podcasts. Does the world really need a billion and one?&#8221; After some back and forth, I relented and said, &#8220;You know what? Let&#8217;s do an experiment. We&#8217;ll see if we can make five good episodes and if anyone listens. If we get that far, then we can make a decision about do we continue on.&#8221; Everybody got very excited and said, &#8220;Absolutely. Great. We&#8217;re going to make this an amazing show.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some time later, it may have been a week or two, the team came back to me and they said, &#8220;By the way, Ian, you&#8217;re hosting.&#8221; It was never discussed in the original planning, and no one thought to bring it up, I think because they knew that I probably would&#8217;ve shut it down if there was any discussion of me being the host. It was only after I had said yes where I got locked in. Honestly, those first couple episodes, you were on episode number one, it was a learn on the job experience for me. I&#8217;d never done anything like it before. So to everyone that has complimented me along the way, thank you. It&#8217;s given me the courage to keep doing it, &#8217;cause for a while there, it was really hard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, they locked you in there really early, but it&#8217;s been great. So now we got to learn a little bit about your background and what landed you here at Chainalysis. So I wanted to start by talking about your pre Chainalysis career, and you spent much of your career working at Pivotal before it turned into VMware. So can you just tell us a little bit about what you were doing there?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I&#8217;ve spent my whole career now working in what I call emerging tech, generally, business-to-business technology that big companies around the world use to run their businesses. Prior to Chainalysis, as you said, I was at a company called Pivotal. We spun that out of EMC and VMware way back in 2013 and grew it up from very small to actually taking it public in 2018, which was this amazing experience. By 2019, we realized that we were on a collision course competing with VMware, and so we entered into a process to sell the company back into VMware and combine it with one of their divisions. We did that on the last day of 2019. So as the pandemic started in 2020, I was one of two executives from Pivotal that stayed on to help guide the integration and launch a new business unit for VMware.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the end of 2020, like everybody else, I was spending a lot more time than I was used to locked in my house wondering what the future might hold. I got a call from a recruiter who I knew a little bit who said, &#8220;Hey, you should really look at this company Chainalysis.&#8221; I had never heard of the company before at all. So I start googling and after a couple of minutes of trying to figure out how to spell Chainalysis and finding the website, I realized it had something to do with crypto, which, to be honest, at the time was a little bit of a deterrent because I really didn&#8217;t know anything about the space. I had some basic knowledge in the public key infrastructure, public key cryptography broadly. So the idea of a blockchain made some technical sense to me, but I didn&#8217;t really understand the ecosystem of crypto. All I knew was at some point all the prices go up and then all the prices go down and then a bunch of people go to jail.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s about right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I was really operating at headlines of the industry level, what I would occasionally read on a site like TechCrunch, and so I felt very intimidated. I was like, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know that I can add a lot to this because isn&#8217;t a space that I know. There&#8217;s got to be more qualified people out there than this.&#8221; Luckily, the recruiter coaxed me a little bit and said, &#8220;Hey, at least take a meeting with our CEO Michael Gronager because he&#8217;s really interested to meet you.&#8221; Of course, as people who listen to the podcast probably know, I love talking to founders. I think there&#8217;s this special mental condition that you have to have to actually start a company and try and build something from nothing. So I&#8217;m fascinated to talk to anyone who&#8217;s ever attempted that, let alone been as successful as Michael and the team at Chainalysis had been by that point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Over the course of the next month, I got to meet Jonathan and some of our board members. I actually talked to a couple of customers, and I was totally sold, probably still didn&#8217;t really understand what I was getting myself into, but I was very excited about the company and the potential. I remember negotiating an employment agreement with Michael over email. He was on a runway somewhere, I think, going or coming to Miami maybe from Copenhagen. This was over New Year&#8217;s weekend, and we came to an agreement. I walked in the first day back at work at VMware and turned in my resignation-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230; and started here two weeks later. So it was a whirlwind and it hasn&#8217;t-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s incredible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230; slowed down in three years. It&#8217;s still as crazy as that whole interview experience has that set the tone for the entire time I&#8217;ve been at the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, it sounds like you were at a fast-growing company, went through IPO acquisitions, and you joined another fast-growing company in a fast-growing industry. I&#8217;m curious if there was an aha moment during the interview process of when you knew you were going to do it, what was it that really pushed you over the edge into joining Chainalysis?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think there were two insights that I gained that I didn&#8217;t have initially when I was maybe a little skeptical talking to that recruiter. One was that Chainalysis is a software company. We&#8217;re not building another Layer 1 blockchain. We&#8217;re not trying to launch a wallet. We&#8217;re definitely not shilling, some scammy token. So that made me much more comfortable, &#8217;cause my experience has been building software companies for two decades, so I was like, &#8220;Oh, I actually can help with that. I need to go learn the industry, but I&#8217;ve got a lot that I can bring to the table here, I believe.&#8221; Then the second thing that got me really excited was at the time, I think Chainalysis had right around 300 customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We were maybe just under 50 million in revenue and only about 200 employees, and that combination of scale, but broad success and those 300 customers weren&#8217;t concentrated in Silicon Valley friends and family companies. This was globally distributed at the time, I think in 60 countries. That is such a rare combination that I looked at it and I said, &#8220;I may not fully understand this industry and some of the competitive dynamics, but it is so unusual to see a company have that much success largely on a referral basis.&#8221; There wasn&#8217;t a large sales team, there wasn&#8217;t really a marketing team at that point, but the products clearly worked and they met a need. So at that point, I was totally sold.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, I think there might not have been a marketing team at that point anyway, if I remember correctly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There were six or seven key people, many of whom are still here today and some of my favorite colleagues and biggest contributors to the success of the company, so I give them way more credit than I would ever take myself. But we had to go build a team so that we could scale the effect they were having, and that&#8217;s what I think I was able to contribute.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah. So you&#8217;re joining this new crypto company, you&#8217;ve been sold by the wonderful founders and the fact that there&#8217;s all this potential. What was your level of blockchain knowledge, and how did you bridge the gap so quickly when you joined?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, the only thing that I really understood coming in is I had worked over 20 years ago on a very large-scale public key infrastructure project. As part of that, I dove really deep into understanding public key cryptography, and so I had foundational technical knowledge. So when I started sitting down to understand, &#8220;Okay, what&#8217;s a Layer 1 blockchain? What&#8217;s a Layer 2 blockchain?&#8221; I was like, &#8220;Oh, I actually understand what&#8217;s happening here. I understand how a wallet works and how your public key and your private key work.&#8221; So I had a good technical foundation of the basics, but I had zero knowledge of the industry, and all of a sudden, I&#8217;m confronted with our customer list.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Half of the companies have either coin or bit or both in the names and my head was spinning. It was like, &#8220;I can&#8217;t tell these people apart,&#8221; and then it was amazing. I think the first night I had access to my laptop, I stayed up till 2:00 in the morning reading customer win stories and just going back in time, I think I went back 12 months, stayed up till 2:00 in the morning, and I was totally blown away at the location where these companies were. I just didn&#8217;t really appreciate how global crypto was &#8217;cause it completely defied the adoption pattern that you see in most tech.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For all of my tech starts in Silicon Valley, it will move east across the United States, eventually jump to the United Kingdom, maybe hop into Germany as a secondary location in Europe. Two or three years later it shows up in the Asia Pacific markets. Crypto is not like that at all. It&#8217;s very Asia Pacific dominant. It&#8217;s very global South dominant, so a huge amount of activity in Latin America and Africa as we&#8217;ve seen from all of your research and the customers reflect that. So that immediately presented this huge challenge to me of, &#8220;Oh, gosh, we&#8217;re going to have to think about marketing a little bit differently here because we can&#8217;t run the same playbook that I&#8217;ve used in past companies,&#8221; which presented a fun challenge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s so interesting. I completely echo your approach to learn about the technology. Whenever anyone joins, I just say, &#8220;Go do a transaction. Just get down to-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230; basics because then you can build everything intuitively from there.&#8221; I think a lot of people in crypto have this blocker where they just&#8230; it&#8217;s too new. But actually if you just go down to basics and start from the very foundation, you can really learn. But the industry stuff is interesting. You were at Chainalysis&#8217; first CMO, and what was your mandate for when you first started, and how did you go about paving the way as creating this new role?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, I think the thing that we wanted to do when I joined was grow. Keep in mind this was January of 2021, so we were already in a bull market cycle. Chainalysis had just raised our Series C few months prior to my joining, so first time the company really had meaningful amount of capital so we could grow in advance of winning customers and booking revenue. So a lot of my time was spent figuring out, &#8220;Okay, what is the strategy for customer acquisition and where should we be applying resources?&#8221; Then, &#8220;Well, what people do we actually need in order to do that effectively?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So it really was a build from the ground up approach and it was very collaborative with the rest of the exec team, &#8217;cause we weren&#8217;t just doing that in marketing, we had to do that in sales. We had to do that in engineering, we had to do that in all of the corporate functions teams. I think we came close to doubling the size of the company in that first year, which is an amazing pace of growth if you look back on it. We also doubled the number of customers that we had in that first year too, which felt pretty good at the time that we had landed on something that was going to be incredibly successful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s awesome. There&#8217;s so many questions I could ask about marketing and crypto and the journey, but since this is the 100th episode, and I think it is a good time to look back on some of the best of. What were some of your favorite episodes? What were some of the episodes that did the best? What have you learned? So with that, I know that you guys pulled some of the best performing episodes. Are there any that you want to highlight in particular that really stood out throughout this past 100 episodes?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I think the topic of pig butchering has become a personal favorite of mine, so I&#8217;d probably start there. We actually just published an episode, so if folks missed it, go back in the stream a couple episodes in your podcast player and you&#8217;ll find it. They compiled clips from across five different episodes with different guests that we had done covering pig butchering. I think that this issue of scams really plagues crypto, and to me, it&#8217;s something that we&#8217;ve got to solve if we want to see more people gain benefit from the technology. You can&#8217;t wake up every day worried that you&#8217;re going to lose your entire net worth because somebody&#8217;s convinced you to click on a link that you didn&#8217;t mean to in an email or on a website.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I think the scam problem is a huge one, and I think the episodes that we&#8217;ve done there has been terrific. Pig butchering honestly wasn&#8217;t a term I had ever heard of until the first episode. I think we had Alistair McCready on now almost two years ago from Vice News explaining that whole problem to us. Since then, it&#8217;s become this global phenomenon where it&#8217;s actually hard to read the news on a given day and not come across somebody referencing issues with these investment romance scams. But that&#8217;s probably my top set of episodes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So do you think that the pig butchering, it&#8217;s this issue, it comes up all the time. We talk about it a lot on the research team, it&#8217;s certainly in the news all the time. It plays to, I think crypto crime in particular gets put under a magnifying glass because of how we can see all the data, but it is also plaguing the industry. Do you think it&#8217;s getting the attention that it deserves? Do you think it&#8217;s hyped up? What do you think about the international attention on pig butchering in particular?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think we&#8217;re in a moment where it feels like there&#8217;s a lot of attention on it, but that doesn&#8217;t seem to necessarily be stopping, unfortunately, victims getting scammed, and it appears to be highly lucrative for the people behind the scams. We&#8217;re now seeing this industrialization of the scammer activity where they&#8217;re running large-scale physical plants with hundreds of thousands of people, many of whom have been coerced or even kidnapped into working in these scam farms. So to me, that says we still haven&#8217;t figured out a solution to the problem. It&#8217;s too profitable for the criminals, but there&#8217;s a lot of smart people working on it. I would say to listeners out there, the message is, if you get invited to participate in something where you are going to make an unbelievable amount of money with zero risk, that is probably a scam. Don&#8217;t do it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don&#8217;t do it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Don&#8217;t do it. There&#8217;s certainly a lot of technical scams where people are fooled for other reasons. We&#8217;ve done a lot of things on approval phishing scams, and that&#8217;s almost a different category in my mind. I think the pig butchering scam, which implies this long con trust and confidence game, it really is this thing where I think people have this underlying desire to get rich quick and are a little too trusting. Unfortunately, the solve here may be just be more skeptical. Don&#8217;t believe it if it sounds too good to be true.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah. Yeah. That&#8217;s a lesson that&#8217;s not just in crypto, it&#8217;s in everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Absolutely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Totally, and that&#8217;s the thing, actually. I think pig butchering in some ways is maybe becoming synonymous with crypto. We&#8217;re a crypto podcast and we talk about this topic all the time, but a lot of these scams actually have nothing to do with crypto. We can obviously see the money moving in crypto much easier than we can through the traditional banking system, but my guess without having data to back it up is that there&#8217;s probably as much if not more money being scammed from victims completely outside of crypto. So I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a crypto specific thing. I think it is much, much broader than that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I totally agree. Keeping in consumer protection, another topic that you covered last week was pump and dump schemes in market manipulation. So what are your thoughts around how we can better protect consumers when it comes to market manipulation, especially with the current bull run that we&#8217;re experiencing and we know that there&#8217;s a little bit of exuberance when the price is running up so quickly?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I&#8217;ve definitely had quite a few friends in the last few weeks reach out and say, &#8220;Ian, this is now the time to buy Bitcoin.&#8221; I have to laugh a little bit at that. My advice, by the way, to everybody is don&#8217;t take financial advice from me. I&#8217;m a podcast host, not a financial advisor. The thing that I&#8217;ve observed in crypto, and I&#8217;m not a markets expert, so take this with a grain of salt, is that crypto markets are incredibly easy to manipulate. So just yesterday as we were recording this, there was a flash crash in Bitcoin, went all the way down to I think $8,900 on one exchange called BitMax, which has a very small spot trading venue, so very low liquidity. Now, on all the other exchanges, Bitcoin was trading around $69,000, but for about an hour on BitMax, if you had funds there, you could have bought Bitcoin in the spot market at or around eight to $10,000.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So now there&#8217;s all this speculation about, well, was that someone intentionally trying to manipulate the spot market in order to take advantage of it in the much larger derivatives market that happens on BitMax? I don&#8217;t have any evidence of that, it&#8217;s unclear, or was this simply someone who was trying to transact and sell as quickly as possible a fairly large block of Bitcoin? Maybe they&#8217;d gained it through illicit activity. They didn&#8217;t want to move it to a different trading venue, they were just trying to liquidate into another asset so they could move it around. All of those are possibilities. We may never know the answer, but when you have situations like that in the asset that is the most widely traded, has the deepest liquidity has been around the longest, is arguably the most protected trustworthy network, yeah, there&#8217;s market manipulation happening in these assets. When you go to the long tail of things like meme coins or fly-by-night NFT projects, there&#8217;s a lot of people out there who are trying to take your money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I think if you want to participate, you should participate with knowing that. My advice to friends is, &#8220;Look, if you want to walk into a casino where you know you&#8217;re going to be playing cards against Phil Ivey or one of the greats of poker because that&#8217;s entertaining to you and you recognize when you sit down in all likelihood you&#8217;re losing all the money that you put on the table, that&#8217;s totally fine. We&#8217;re adults and we can make those decisions. You should spend your money on the things that entertain you and make you happy. If you treat crypto the same way, that&#8217;s great. So if you want to trade in these thin meme coins and see if you can grab one that gains 15,000% in a week, awesome. But you also have to be prepared that it could go to zero immediately or you could get rug pulled or something else could happen and your investment completely goes away. As long as you&#8217;re going into it eyes wide open, then have fun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I remember talking to Gronager a few years ago and everyone was saying it&#8217;s just financial entertainment. His response was, &#8220;Yeah, people enjoy that. That has value in and of itself if you want it to-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Absolutely. We see this outside of crypto as well. Just like pig butchering, this phenomenon isn&#8217;t isolated to the crypto markets. It&#8217;s maybe more obvious measurable, acute in crypto, but meme trading inequities is the exact same thing. I think, to be honest, as an outside observer of Wall Street, the mentality probably exists amongst professional traders as well in all sorts of other assets that have nothing to do with the world of crypto. But obviously, we get a little bit more attention on it because this is new and it&#8217;s so much easier to understand what&#8217;s going on when you have tools like Chainalysis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So with all of this in mind, though, you do still have questions around, I think you had a conversation with this a while ago about what it means to be an accredited investor and what rules should be followed in order to allow for financial speculation, but also keep people safe if they want to safely invest. So do you think that the U.S. and other jurisdictions should adopt investors having to maybe take a test or before investing in digital assets, how do you think that the accreditation should unfold?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I think the U.S. rules on this particular topic are silly because it&#8217;s a means test, which says you have to have a certain amount of liquid assets. So it can&#8217;t include your house. It needs to be in something like stocks or bonds or cash in order to participate in certain types of securities offerings. So you don&#8217;t have to be accredited to buy Apple stock at Schwab, but you do have to be accredited to buy shares in a privately-held company that hasn&#8217;t yet listed publicly. There&#8217;s a lot more complexity to that. I&#8217;m, again, not a securities lawyer, but to me that just doesn&#8217;t make good sense. You&#8217;re excluding a certain portion of the population from participating in activities that could be wealth creating. That doesn&#8217;t feel fair to me just on the face of it. I know that there&#8217;s a strong desire amongst people that support that rule to say, &#8220;Well, we need to protect less sophisticated investors from being scammed or tricked.&#8221; As we just talked about, there&#8217;s lots of people out there looking to take your money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So at some point there was a well-meaning intent behind the rule, but I think the approach is different. We actually had a guest on from the Asia Pacific region, I think they were in Malaysia if I&#8217;m recalling correctly. They explained that in their country it&#8217;s not a means test, it&#8217;s a knowledge test. So just like you have to pass an exam to get a driver&#8217;s license and be able to operate a car, if you want to invest, you have to pass an exam and demonstrate that you actually know what you&#8217;re doing. To me, that just seems on the face of it, incredibly fair. Anyone that can demonstrate reasonable knowledge is then allowed to invest in all sorts of exotic instruments. If you don&#8217;t take the test or you can&#8217;t pass it &#8217;cause you haven&#8217;t learned the ins and outs, well, yeah, you probably should stick to buying Apple shares in your Schwab account. I love that approach. It would be tremendous if the U.S. adopted that model.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, very interesting. Very interesting. Well, some other episodes besides consumer protection, pig butchering, market manipulation, which we could talk about all day, have been around decentralized finance, decentralized ID, cloud infrastructure, killer apps, smart contract audits. So I&#8217;m going to drill into a few just to get your thoughts on some of these topics that have come up because you get to talk to everyone. So you get to put your finger on the pulse of where everyone is and then come to a synthesized output or view of this. So specifically, Eric and I had a little bit of a disagreement on the crime podcast about whether or not DeFi is getting safer, and we have looked to different data points. We&#8217;ve seen that the amount hacked is down, but the number of hacks is up, but the types of attack vectors are changing. What is your thoughts on hacks on DeFi and bridge protocols?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, I think the interesting thing about that conversation for me was if we look back over the last few years, there&#8217;s been some really large outlier hacks that I think play with the numbers a little bit. Axie Infinity was such an outlier in the scale because it was so popular at the moment that it got hacked, there was so much value locked in that bridge contract that I think it may be skewed some of the historical comparisons. So when we say the dollars are down year over year, well, yeah, it&#8217;s a hard compare. I can&#8217;t think of the Axie Infinity equivalent from 2023 because DeFi just wasn&#8217;t experiencing that boom moment. The play-to-earn games or an experiencing that boom moment. There just wasn&#8217;t as much financial value happening in the space. So rather than looking at the value hacks, I tended to look towards the number of successful hacks, and I think that number was fairly consistent year to year-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230; which, to me, says we haven&#8217;t yet figured this out. But I did take some solace in the fact that the nature of the hacks are changing. So we went from, I think, predominantly key compromise and contract exploit. That was the mode of most of the large hacks that we saw in 2021 and &#8217;22 to a lot of social engineering hacks, which to me says, oh, we&#8217;re actually improving on security because now the soft target is actually going after the humans. So I think that&#8217;s good news, but obviously, we&#8217;ve got to keep an eye on it this year, right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As TVL is growing in the DeFi ecosystem, it&#8217;s going to become a more interesting target again. The folks who are coming after this are professionals. They&#8217;ve got one motivation, which is, take as much money as they possibly can. But I&#8217;m also excited about, we&#8217;ve had a lot of people on the show who are building security technology to help protocols defend themselves more effectively. So I actually think the problems we&#8217;ve seen over the last few years have motivated some awesome founders to really up the security game across the crypto ecosystem. So I&#8217;m optimistic that we&#8217;ve got the tools and the weapons to play better defense as we go forward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, yeah. Some of these startups are just really pushing the boundaries of what&#8217;s possible to keep this industry safe. Now I think we&#8217;re just about adopting the right ones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exactly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okay, so this next one is actually one of my favorite questions, and I was really interested to hear your specific take on it, which is that one common theme is that many people say there&#8217;s no killer app for crypto and there&#8217;s no killer use case. What&#8217;s your reaction to that? What&#8217;s your opinion on that. When you&#8217;re at dinner and your distant relative says something like that, how do you usually respond?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, so I think there&#8217;s a couple parts to this. Part one, is crypto is really hard to use. When we think about killer apps, the ones that have gone most viral that as soon as it was launched, we all downloaded it, or the seven or eight apps that you use on your phone every single day, they have a great level of usability. I have never found that anywhere in crypto. It&#8217;s incredibly hard to use a wallet. Every time I send a transaction, it&#8217;s nerve wracking. A bead of sweat forms on my forehead thinking about, &#8220;Am I sending this to the right address? Is it on the right network? I can&#8217;t believe that this is how this works.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I think we need to solve that layer of usability, otherwise, it&#8217;s going to be really hard to get to the killer app experience. So that&#8217;s part one. Part two is I think for you and I sitting in the United States, crypto is not an absolute necessary thing. We live in a country with generally pretty good rule of law protections, property rights, intellectual property, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, a court system that generally works, and a really robust financial system. If I want to send you $20, am I going to do it in crypto or am I going to do it over Venmo? I pay all my kids&#8217; babysitters in Venmo. It&#8217;s really easy. It always works. There&#8217;s no complexity. It ties into the banking system really nicely. I don&#8217;t worry about transactions getting blocked &#8217;cause touching crypto.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I think for people that live in North America and most of Western Europe, the need for what crypto provides today is mostly absent. But I think when you go to other parts of the world, it becomes acutely necessary. So I&#8217;ve had guests on the show from all over Africa, from many parts of Southeast Asia, from Latin America, and in those countries you have a very different experience. You have a financial system that is generally considered to be unstable. In many cases, you have super high inflation. You have capital currency controls that make it really difficult even when you have money to get that money outside the country to buy something abroad, your currency may be worth nothing outside your own country because it&#8217;s got an artificial exchange rate, and you often don&#8217;t have rule of law protections, freedom of the press or any of the other things that we associate with modern democracy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So you don&#8217;t really want the government knowing what you&#8217;re doing with your money because you may disagree with their politics and their philosophy, and so crypto is a amazing solution for all of those things. I think when we look at our Geo Reports adoption data, the countries where grassroots adoption is happening most frequently tend to correspond to the countries that have the characteristics I was just talking about. To me, that is the killer app today. Now, I think if we improve usability, back to point one, that suddenly changes the usefulness to people in North America and Western Europe because right now, their excitement is primarily playing in the crypto casino. It&#8217;s an opportunity for arbitrage and fun entertainment of trading and things like that versus it becoming a necessity, but I still believe we could get there potentially.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also get a little bit confused when people say, &#8220;What&#8217;s the killer app?&#8221; &#8216;Cause I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Well, what are you asking for exactly. Everyone knows what crypto is. They use it, they transfer value. What do you mean by killer app? What are you looking for?&#8221; So I think it&#8217;s an ambiguous question to begin with anyway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s true. It&#8217;s true for sure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So with moving on to the big exciting Bitcoin ETF, we&#8217;ve been waiting for that for so long. It&#8217;s been such a pivotal thing to come through recently. Dare I ask, what&#8217;s the next big challenge that the industry should overcome? We were laser focused on the ETF for so long, and that seems to have materialized. So now where do we go?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I think the ETF is really interesting because on one hand, if you&#8217;re a crypto maxi, I think this has to be a little bit of a antithesis to your theology, if you will, because the people who are buying crypto in an ETF really don&#8217;t touch crypto. You tell your wealth advisor, &#8220;Hey, put a few thousand dollars into this, buy some shares of this ETF,&#8221; you never have a crypto wallet. You don&#8217;t interact with a blockchain. You never actually hold the asset directly. If you sell the shares later, it&#8217;s redeemed in cash. The whole thing is very arm&#8217;s length. But I do think it&#8217;s interesting because to me, the entire financial system has been trending from the very real physical world to more and more synthetic digital, if you will, products over time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The most widely-traded things or widely held in the United States are index funds where you&#8217;re not even picking a particular company, you&#8217;re just saying, &#8220;Well, I want all the companies that are in the S&amp;P 500.&#8221; That&#8217;s where the most investible dollars sit right now.&#8221; It gets automatically allocated across fractional shares of the companies that happen to make up that index. So I think on some level, the fact that we&#8217;ve got an ETF for Bitcoin is really just continuation of that trend. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, this is another commodity. It&#8217;s a thing that we can carve up and that people generally believe in,&#8221; which is this incredible milestone. The fact that it&#8217;s worth anything is, in some ways, tremendous because it was created of nothing. It&#8217;s an entirely digital good with no association to any real thing. But on the other hand, it&#8217;s like, yeah, that&#8217;s what finance has been trending toward in a ton of different products over the long arc of history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The financialization-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of everything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230; of everything is in the 70s and the 80s-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah. Yeah. It&#8217;s just a continuation of that. So I think it&#8217;s remarkable, but it&#8217;s also something that I think if you held a certain perspective, you could have predicted we would end up here. What comes next is unknown because in the U.S. right now we have this regulatory stalemate. The SEC very begrudgingly approved the 10 ETFs plus the gray scale conversion. It doesn&#8217;t seem likely that they&#8217;re going to agree to do this for another asset. Ethereum is the one that the applications are stacking up for right now, but I would expect at least a multi-year fight. Potentially, we have a change in the executive branch here in the U.S. with a new president coming in early next year, so that may lead us down a path where there&#8217;s an about face towards crypto.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if that doesn&#8217;t happen, it seems likely that we stay in the stalemate, so I&#8217;m looking abroad. I think Europe passing MiCA actually brings an opportunity for that region of the world to have some major adoption. The Middle East is pushing ahead really aggressively, particularly in Dubai. Singapore, I was just there a few weeks ago. It seems like enthusiasm and support for crypto is certainly happening in the business community, and I think the regulators there, the monetary authority seems to be leaning towards more and more support. So I&#8217;m not sure which way it&#8217;s going to go, but I&#8217;m looking abroad for where the next big thing comes from.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What can the U.S. do to stay relevant here?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think the U.S. is going to play a role in crypto because so many of the venture capitalists that are funding the companies that are going to make a difference are U.S.-based. The concentration of venture capital dollars is still anchored to the United States relative to financing from anywhere else in the world. I think a lot of the founders, people that have the mentality to go start a company, so many of them, it&#8217;s part of the American psyche. So I still expect companies to be founded here, but honestly today, if you&#8217;re thinking about starting a company and you&#8217;re in the U.S., are you going to pick crypto and fight uphill against this regulatory mess? Or are you going to pick something like AI and run quickly ahead before other companies? That&#8217;s a tough decision right now. So I would love for us to sort some things out and get to reasonable regulation that protects consumers, set some ground rules for the industry so we don&#8217;t have a repeat of 2022 and enables some awesome companies to be created here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think it&#8217;s definitely, for a long time in crypto people were thinking of short-term wins, and now I think we&#8217;re shifted to long-term wins. So I guess shifting back to Ian the CMO, I think that anyone who watches the podcast would notice that you very much light up when you talk to technical founders because you are one of the very few truly technical CMOs in the industry. So when you&#8217;re thinking about some of the founders that you&#8217;ve talked to who are really, really deep into tech, what are some of the companies that really stand out that gets you excited, who&#8217;s got a great founding team, got a great tech stack, got a great vision you&#8217;ve had the pleasure of talking to on the podcast?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, I will name a couple of companies here, and thank you for the compliment. I try very hard to play technical on the podcast. I don&#8217;t know that I actually am. No one&#8217;s going to pay me to write code, just to be clear, but-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">[inaudible 00:43:16] ChatGPT now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s true. I can pay ChatGPT to write code that someone else can pay me to copy and paste. I think one of the podcasts thinking back that I think is most interesting was the founder of Iron Fish. For people that don&#8217;t remember this episode, you should go back and listen to it. Iron Fish is this amazing&#8230; the entire blockchain is built on zero-knowledge proofs. Thinking about it from the perspective of Chainalysis, we have built an entire business around being able to understand relationships between entities on the blockchain and mapping that to the real-world people or companies that are behind those transactions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zero-knowledge starts to change that approach pretty materially, and so they&#8217;re developing an entire chain where every transaction is a zero-knowledge proof. That spun me off into a bunch of what if questions about what might happen in the future if all blockchains were entirely zero-knowledge, particularly for our business. But also I think for how most people have become accustomed to thinking about blockchain as this public ledger where there is a lot of information that can be gained and used to benefit. If it all suddenly becomes very private and opaque, does that really start to change the entire nature of the crypto industry?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Very interesting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So that was one. The other one, actually, I&#8217;m going to plug an episode that we&#8217;re recording next week with my friend Gal Sagie, who&#8217;s the CEO at a company called Hypernative. This is going back into our conversation about security for DeFi protocols. I think what the team at Hypernative has done it incredible because it is actually real-time detection of threats across the cryptocurrency landscape. So they&#8217;ve been consistently over the last two years able to alert their customers ahead of an attack occurring against the protocol, giving you time to do things like block the attacker addresses or potentially pause the protocol if you need to take it that far, and I think that is a complete game changer. So I am super excited to record that episode next week and get it out to our audience soon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, yeah, yeah, hypernative is a really cool company. What about for the marketer, the inner Ian marketer? Being on the marketing team, I&#8217;ve learned that marketing is really hard and so it&#8217;s really hard to do. So what advice do you have for a team that&#8217;s technically sound, got a great product, but they&#8217;re having a tough time finding a product market fit, communicating to the industry? Are there any easy things that companies can implement if they&#8217;re really struggling with connecting their product with an audience?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, I would say stop trying to do marketing and start doing storytelling. The thing that we do best at Chainalysis is we tell stories. If we stood out there on the corner like, &#8220;Hey, we&#8217;ve got all this data, come buy some data,&#8221; I don&#8217;t think many people are going to engage with us. Instead, we start with, &#8220;Let me tell you about what&#8217;s happening on the blockchain. Would you like to know where crypto is actually being adopted all around the world?&#8221; What do we get with that? Well, we get a line of people out the door. Literally, thousands if not tens of thousands of people attend our webinars and download those reports. We do the same thing with our crime data. &#8220;Hey, everyone says crypto is entirely criminal activity. Well, do you want to know the truth? Turns out, it&#8217;s probably less than 1% of all transactions have anything to do with illicit activity.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Obviously, we take the story further than that, but I think by starting with a story, it allows you to attract people. Whereas, if you start with the technology, you&#8217;re only going to get the people that already understand the thing you&#8217;re building and the problem you&#8217;re solving. When you&#8217;re in an emerging technology market like we are, that list is going to be so, so short. You might draw a crowd at East Denver in one of the technical breakouts who are also working on similar problems and really want to go nerd out on what you&#8217;re building. But if you&#8217;re trying to build a company, you&#8217;ve got to go get all the people that don&#8217;t understand your technology and probably don&#8217;t even know they have a problem that needs to be solved. To me, you&#8217;ve got to be able to tell a story that attracts them into a conversation so you can ultimately demonstrate the really cool thing you&#8217;re building.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s a really good point. When I&#8217;m doing the crime reports, I don&#8217;t feel like I&#8217;m marketing, I&#8217;m just figuring out what&#8217;s going on and we put it into the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So many people think marketing is a trick, like, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m going to have a trade show booth, and I&#8217;m going to give you a whole bunch of merchandise branded socks and T-shirts and hats. Then once I&#8217;ve got you into my clutches &#8217;cause I made you sign up and give me your email address. Then I&#8217;m going to spam you until you relent and buy my product.&#8221; That is not an efficient way to market. It&#8217;s way easier if you can help give people what they want. Usually, in an emerging tech market that starts with education. People are hungry to learn, and so if you can be seen as a go-to source to actually get smarter, folks tend to trust you. They tend to come back to you. They tend to engage with you, and then that gives you license to tell them other things. So start with a story. Try and be educational. Try and be helpful. Don&#8217;t spam people. That&#8217;s just terrible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sorry, did I cut out there for a second?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You&#8217;re good.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, I&#8217;m good? Okay. Sorry, I missed the end of that sentence so it froze for a moment, so I&#8217;m just going to-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sorry about that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, we&#8217;re good. We can keep going to the next question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okay, sorry about that. Okay, so now I&#8217;m just going to do a few lightning round questions to get to know Ian. So we&#8217;ve talked a lot about this podcast. What are your favorite podcasts that you&#8217;re listening to outside of the public key?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, I listen to a ton of podcasts, and some of them I listen to religiously every week, every episode. Others I jump in and out of, so I&#8217;ll just name three. Number one for me is probably Pivot, which is the Kara Swisher, Scott Galloway podcast. I&#8217;m a tech nerd. They cover tech and they&#8217;re hilarious, and they know everybody. They get good guests, but I&#8217;ll be out on a run listening and just laugh out loud with their banter, so ton of fun. Next one is Invest Like the Best. So the host is a guy named Patrick O&#8217;Shaughnessy. He gets fantastic guests. They talk a lot about investing strategy, company building, some really great insights from across a wide range of industries that I just love.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then last one, number three is Lex Friedman. I used to really not like long form podcasts. I&#8217;m like, &#8220;How can I spend four hours on anything? This is insane.&#8221; Then I got very comfortable at listening at 1.75 speed, so four hours becomes two, and suddenly Lex Friedman is one of my favorite podcasts. He is one of the most enthusiastic, kind, caring people, at least his persona on the podcast. I don&#8217;t know him in real life, but it blows me away, his engagement and interaction with people. He&#8217;s also incredibly technically deep in areas that I find also fascinating, like artificial intelligence and physics and launching rockets. So he gets a ton of content on there that I love. So those would be three that I would recommend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, those are all great. What about, who would you in your dream world would you have on the podcast?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, this is a tough one for me &#8217;cause we publish every week, so I would honestly have anybody on the podcast that&#8217;s got a great story to tell. If you&#8217;ve got one, DM me on Twitter and we will arrange a time to record. But right now, I&#8217;m reading Fei-Fei Lee&#8217;s autobiography. So if you don&#8217;t know who she is, a pioneer in modern computer vision. She actually runs Stanford&#8217;s AI Lab, what&#8217;s called SAIL, pioneer in the industry. This is her autobiography I&#8217;m reading right now. She grew up in China, moved to the U.S. in late middle school, early high school speaking almost no English and had to completely relearn to communicate and has had an incredible career, incredible life story. So I would love to just talk to her about that right now. The impact that she&#8217;s had on artificial intelligence and computer vision is just incredible. So that would be probably guest number one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Number two, and if I can&#8217;t get her as a guest, I&#8217;ll recommend everybody go read her book. Number two, I would be interested to talk to Vitalik. I&#8217;ve never met him. From the outside, he seems like almost a very typical engineer, quiet, reserved, someone that wants to go write code and build cool products, and he&#8217;s become this incredible celebrity. In the world of crypto, people go nuts to take pictures with him, and so I&#8217;m just so curious about how he&#8217;s dealing with that. What&#8217;s his mental thinking around the experience of becoming a celebrity, a rock star in the crypto world? I think it would be a really interesting conversation. Then the last one, because he&#8217;s so pivotal in our industry right now and painted as a villain, Gary Gensler. Again, I&#8217;ve never met the man. I don&#8217;t know anything personally about him, but I wonder maybe deep down he&#8217;s really a closet crypto fan. The whole thing is politics and charade and actually&#8230; or maybe he lost a bunch of money in a bad Bitcoin trade or his wallet got robbed or something like that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It all comes out on the public key.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exactly. I want to get to the root of the ire for the industry. I think it would be really, really fun to do. So that&#8217;s my list.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That would be great if we could get those three on. What about for anyone looking to start a podcast? Now, you&#8217;re a podcaster now-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I guess, so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You&#8217;re 100 episodes in. What lessons for someone who&#8217;s just launching?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think the biggest thing about starting a podcast is that you have to look at it similar to how I look at running a marathon. It&#8217;s easy to do one episode, just like it&#8217;s easy to run one mile, you can get to five pretty quickly. But 20 episodes is a lot of work, and it takes a lot of time and commitment to get there. So if you&#8217;re thinking about starting a podcast, you need to think about, &#8220;Well, where&#8217;s the finish line? What am I trying to get to? What&#8217;s my goal? How do I imagine I&#8217;m going to be successful?&#8221; &#8216;Cause along the way, there&#8217;s a lot of distractions. My full-time job is not podcasting. I do this as a side when I&#8217;m done with my full-time job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So it&#8217;s easy to have conflicting time demands that get in the way or make it tricky to schedule recording with the next guest or planning the next couple episodes. So if you don&#8217;t feel like you can make that commitment, then I would say maybe podcasting&#8217;s not for you, but also it builds over time. So early days&#8217; success, it&#8217;s not like running a web campaign where you put some ads on Facebook and Google and all of a sudden you&#8217;ve got traffic and interest and you&#8217;re selling products. I don&#8217;t know that anybody listened to our first handful of episodes other than maybe some of our colleagues who were being kind. But now we&#8217;ve got a pretty broad audience. We&#8217;ve got PR folks who regularly message me and say, &#8220;Hey, I&#8217;ve got a great guest for you,&#8221; but that&#8217;s two years on. So be patient once you start and good things will come.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So it&#8217;s not just enough to have the idea that you&#8217;re going to start a podcast-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You got one more question in you?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One more. Let&#8217;s do it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All right. So it&#8217;s the future question. So looking to the future, what are you excited about for Chainalysis? Any big launches, partnerships, or features that you can disclose?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh, gosh, there&#8217;s so much stuff going on. Obviously, right now, we&#8217;re in the final preparations for our Links conference. That happens April 9th and 10th in New York City, so hopefully, everyone listening is going to join us there. We&#8217;ve got an incredible lineup of speakers. So that&#8217;s number one. Number two, we have had some amazing news the last few weeks. There was a large trial, the U.S. Department of Justice arrested an individual named Roman Sterlingov and charged him with money laundering for operating something called Bitcoin Fog, which was a pretty notorious crypto mixer regularly used by many of the large dark net market operators. We finally got a ruling in that trial. What was interesting is the defense challenged the reliability of Chainalysis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Really, they went to town publicly in the press as well as directly with the judge questioning whether our product worked and whether the data in our product was valid. Our team did an incredible amount of work led by our expert witness, Beth Bisbee, who actually testified at length in the trial to demonstrate that Chainalysis&#8217; products are both credible and reliable. The judge agreed, rejected the defense&#8217;s that our evidence produced using our products not be admitted, and so that was amazing. It was first of its kind validation in a court of law during a trial of the veracity of Chainalysis information and its usefulness in court to help jurors understand what&#8217;s actually happening on the blockchain. So that was an amazing win for the company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then the DOJ won a conviction in the case too, so that was a really great win for our customers, happy for their success there. So that&#8217;s probably number two. Then number three, I&#8217;ve spent the last three weeks with our sales teams talking about our product roadmap for the year, and we&#8217;ve just got some amazing stuff that we&#8217;re shipping this year. Our R&amp;D team has been building through crypto winter, as the adage goes, and we&#8217;ve got some amazing stuff that we&#8217;re going to be unveiling, starting at Links, but throughout the year, that makes our technology more powerful, makes our data more accessible. So more to come on that front. It&#8217;s going to be a lot of fun. Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, that sounds all amazing. Ian, you are officially out of the hot seat. That&#8217;s all I got for you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks so much, Kim. This has been a ton of fun. I really enjoyed it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you.</span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。2024年3月25日，美国财政部外国资产控制办公室对12家实体和2个个人进行制裁，因为他们帮助建立或运营基于区块链的服务，以促进俄罗斯个人可能逃避制裁。文章详细介绍了被制裁的实体和个人的活动，包括Netex24和Bitpapa。链分析显示，Netex24和Bitpapa向被制裁的实体和暗网市场发送了大量资金，并在乌克兰地区的一些组织进行了交易。美国财政部一直在努力打击基于俄罗斯的加密犯罪，这些努力包括对涉及俄罗斯银行的加密企业进行制裁。 <div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On March 25, 2024, the United States Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) </span><a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2204"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sanctioned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> twelve entities and two individuals for helping to build or operate blockchain-based services to facilitate potential sanctions evasion on behalf of Russian nationals. Five of these entities were operated by OFAC-designated individuals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this blog, we’ll explore the activities of these entities, including an on-chain analysis of addresses we identified as associated with two of the businesses sanctioned: Netex24 and Bitpapa. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Who are the sanctioned entities and individuals and what did they do? </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Most of the sanctioned entities and individuals are based in Russia and all of them are linked to Russia through the services they provided: </span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Joint Stock Company B-Crypto</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> worked with </span><a href="https://ofac.treasury.gov/recent-actions/20221215"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OFAC-designated Rosbank </span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">to support cross-border transactions in crypto. </span></li>
<li><b>Obshchestvo S Ogranichennoy Otvetstvennostyu Sistemy Raspredelennogo Reyestra (Masterchain) </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">has agreements with several OFAC-designated Russian banks to issue digital currencies.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Obshchestvo S Ogranichennoy Otvetstvennostyu Laitkhaus </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">issued and exchanged digital currencies to support several OFAC-designated banks. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Obshchestvo S Ogranichennoy Otvetstvennostyu Atomaiz </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">tokenized diamonds and precious metals on behalf of Russian banks. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Tokentrust Holdings Ltd.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is Atomiaz’s majority shareholder. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Obshchestvo S Ogranichennoy Otvetstvennostyu Veb3 Tekhnologii </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">provided blockchain-based services and platforms for the Russian financial sector, including sanctioned Russian banks. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Obshchestvo S Ogranichennoy Otvetstvennostyu Veb3 Integrator</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also provided blockchain-based services and platforms for the Russian financial sector, including sanctioned Russian banks. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Igor Veniaminovich Kaigorodov </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">is the majority shareholder for Veb3 Tekhnologii and Veb3 Integrator. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Obshchestvo S Ogranichennoy Otvetstvennostyu Tsentr Obrabotki Elektronnykh Platezhey (TOEP) </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">is a digital currency exchange that operates under the names Netexchange and Netex24, and facilitated payments to OFAC-sanctioned banks including Sberbank and Alfa-Bank, as well as </span><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/hydra-garantex-ofac-sanctions-russia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hydra</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the sanctioned darknet market. </span></li>
<li><b>Timur Evgenyevich Bukanov</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is the owner and director of TOEP.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Bitfingroup OÜ</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an Estonia-based company likely controlled by Bukanov. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Bitpapa IC FZC LLC </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">is a peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange that facilitated millions in payments for OFAC-designated Russian cryptocurrency businesses, Garantex and Hydra. </span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Crypto Explorer DMCC </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">operates under the name AWEX as a digital currency exchange based in Russia and the UAE, offering crypto-to-fiat conversions for Russian rubles and UAE dirhams.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Obshchestvo S Ogranichennoy Otvetstvennostyu Kripto Eksplorer (OOO Kripto Eksplorer)</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is owned by Crypto Explorer DMCC. </span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Analyzing the activity of Netex24 and Bitpapa</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its press release on their sanctions designations, OFAC notes that Netex24 and Bitpapa have a history of transacting with OFAC-sanctioned banks, cryptocurrency exchanges, and darknet markets by using cryptocurrency, therefore facilitating potential sanctions evasion for Russia’s financial infrastructure. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we see in the screenshot below, Netex24 supports off-ramping to sanctioned Russian banks Tinkoff and Sberbank, as well as other similar organizations. </span></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-13191" height="457" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/netex-800x457.png" width="800" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although OFAC did not include any crypto addresses in its designations of Netex24 or Bitpapa, Chainalysis has identified clusters associated with both services. Over the last two years, on-chain data shows that both Netex24 and Bitpapa have facilitated significant sending of funds to sanctioned entities. Darknet markets also make up a significant volume of transaction history, in addition to exchanges without Know Your Customer (KYC) controls, many of which are Russian-language sites offering on and off ramping with sanctioned Russian banks.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Value sent by Netex24 and Bitpapa to sanctioned entities and darknet markets has steadily increased since the start of Russia’s war in Ukraine, whereas value sent to exchanges without KYC guidelines and other illicit services has remained relatively flat. </span></p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_13194" style="width: 800px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-13194 size-medium" height="538" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/cumulative-value-800x538.png" width="800" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-13194">Source: Chainalysis Reactor</figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can see examples of some of this activity on the blockchain for both Netex24 and Bitpapa using </span><a href="http://reactor.chainalysis.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chainalysis Reactor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As highlighted in the OFAC designation, both entities transferred millions of dollars in cryptocurrency to Hydra and Garantex, and regularly interacted with Bitzlato. </span></p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_13195" style="width: 800px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-13195 size-medium" height="521" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/graph-asset-v2-eip155-1-native-bitpapa-netex-bad-exposure-1-800x521.png" width="800" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-13195">Source: Chainalysis Reactor</figcaption></figure>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to facilitating transactions on behalf of larger sanctioned financial services and crypto entities, Netex24 and Bitpapa have also facilitated transactions for various </span><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/pro-russian-crypto-donations-war-in-ukraine/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">pro-Russian militia and propaganda groups</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, including </span><a href="https://ofac.treasury.gov/recent-actions/20231102"><span style="font-weight: 400;">MOO Veche</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an OFAC designated Russian militia group. All of these entities have been known to operate in the Donetsk, Luhansk, or Crimean regions of Ukraine. </span></p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_13196" style="width: 800px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-13196 size-medium" height="475" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/graph-asset-v2-algorand-wghe2pwdvd7s12bl5faop20egyesn73k-native-bitpapa-netex-designation-1-800x475.png" width="800" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-13196">Source: Chainalysis Reactor</figcaption></figure>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">OFAC’s continued efforts to combat Russia-based crypto crimes </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As Brian E. Nelson, Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, stated, “Russia is increasingly turning to alternative payment mechanisms to circumvent U.S. sanctions and continue to </span><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/russia-ukraine-war-cryptocurrency-one-year/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">fund its war against Ukraine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.” Based on this designation, sanctions evasion through utilization of cryptocurrency businesses to facilitate on- and off-ramp activities for sanctioned Russian banks appears to be a growing focus for OFAC. These efforts expand on an already extensive focus of the illicit Russian crypto ecosystem, which includes ransomware, darknet markets, militia groups, disinformation groups, and various other cybercrime actors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We commend OFAC for its actions here and have labeled the relevant addresses as associated with Netex24 and Bitpapa in our product suite.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The growth of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ether, and a wide array of stablecoins has proven that investors see unique benefits in blockchain-based digital assets. Now, many in both the crypto world and mainstream finance are working to bring those benefits to traditional assets, in an emerging sub-field of digital assets called </span><b>asset tokenization</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. At its core, asset tokenization means putting the record of ownership for traditional assets on blockchains. Asset tokenization has the potential not only to facilitate more efficient transactions, but also to democratize access to certain kinds of investment opportunities and bring more liquidity to traditionally illiquid asset classes, such as real estate and art. In this blog, we’ll tell you everything you need to know about the current state of asset tokenization and how it works. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this article, we discuss:</span></p>

</ul>
<h2 id="what"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is asset tokenization?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asset tokenization refers to the process of recording the rights to a given asset into a digital token that can be held, sold, and traded on a blockchain. The resulting tokens represent a stake of ownership in the underlying asset. Virtually any asset, whether something physical like real estate or intangible like stock in a corporation, can theoretically be tokenized. Turning these assets into digital tokens makes them more easily divisible, allowing for fractional ownership that enables more people to invest, which can in turn make the markets for those assets more liquid. Asset tokenization can also enable direct, peer-to-peer trading of traditional assets that currently require middlemen, and can also bring greater security and transparency to the marketplace. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchain technology</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/what-are-blockchains/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchain technology</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is at the core of asset tokenization. Blockchains are digital ledgers of transactions and asset balances stored across networks of computers, resulting in an immutable database that acts as a single, shared source of truth. Blockchain technology underpins cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether, providing a secure, transparent, and decentralized platform for tracking the ownership and transfer of tokens. The decentralized nature of most blockchains means that no single entity can alter the ledger, thereby enhancing asset security and lowering the risk of fraud. </span></p>
<h2 id="process"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The tokenization process</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How does one convert a real world asset into a digital token on a blockchain? The answer will vary based by project, but here’s an example of how it could work, using a piece of real estate as our example.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Create the digital tokens.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The first and most important step is to create the tokens that represent shares in the real estate property. In order to do this, one could create legal entity that would exist solely to own the actual real estate being tokenized. The digital tokens would simply represent shares in the entity, thereby entitling holders to a portion of the real estate’s value and benefits, such as rental income or appreciation.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Smart contract implementation.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The issuance, balance tracking, and payouts of benefits associated with the digital tokens representing a tokenized asset would all be governed by </span><a href="https://chain.link/education/smart-contracts"><span style="font-weight: 400;">smart contracts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Smart contracts are decentralized programs built on blockchains that fulfill specific functions and run based on transparent, auditable code. In the case of a tokenized real estate property, the associated smart contracts could handle critical functions like the distribution of rental income, implementation of governance decisions voted on by token owners (similar to a </span><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/introduction-to-decentralized-autonomous-organizations-daos/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">DAO</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">), and payment of expenses associated with maintaining the real estate.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Token distribution and sale.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Once the digital tokens and necessary smart contracts have been created, the next step would be to sell the tokens to investors. This could be done via private sales, an open sale to the public, or a combination of the two using a </span><a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/academy/glossary/whitelist"><span style="font-weight: 400;">whitelist model</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as many other crypto projects have done. The efficient fractionalization of the asset enabled by tokenization could create a bigger, more liquid market for the asset.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Asset management and governance.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> As we alluded to earlier, once the tokens have been sold, holders can take a role in management of the underlying real estate, including physical maintenance, tenant relations, property improvements, and more. The exact level of control given to token holders and as a collective and the process for voting on decisions would have to be laid out in the relevant legal entity’s charter and encoded into the smart contracts associated with the asset. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Secondary market trading.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tokens representing shares in the real estate property could also be traded on secondary markets after launch. This is where the liquidity benefits come into play. Rather than being stuck with an unsellable property as so many real estate investors have over the years, token holders in this example would have greater flexibility and a potentially broader ecosystem of buyers with whom to explore price points. </span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asset tokenization requires significant financial and technical know-how, as well as the meeting of various legal requirements. But as the step-by-step process above shows, it’s hardly inconceivable, and could foster more inclusive, efficient, and transparent markets for traditional asset classes like real estate. </span></p>
<h2 id="benefits"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Benefits of asset tokenization</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asset tokenization is more than just a technological innovation. It could be a paradigm shift in asset management, with benefits for both retail and institutional investors. The transformation of traditional assets into tradeable, blockchain-based tokens can reshape the investment landscape with enhanced accessibility, market efficiency, and security.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Democratization of access</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the most significant potential benefits of asset tokenization is the ability to democratize access to investment opportunities, while still maintaining appropriate safeguards. Traditionally, asset classes like commercial real estate and fine art have been the province of institutional investors or the very wealthy, with high barriers to entry. Asset tokenization can break down those barriers by enabling fractional ownership of assets, meaning investors can own tokens representing small shares of that asset. Fractionalization could lower the minimum threshold for investing in these assets, and allow retail investors to participate in markets previously out of their reach. This would in turn allow a broader range of investors to diversify their portfolios in new ways. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Market fluidity and efficiency</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asset tokenization can enhance market fluidity and efficiency in several ways. First, fractional ownership can increase the liquidity in traditionally illiquid assets like real estate, as investors can buy or sell tokens representing partial ownership quickly and easily, whereas real estate transactions today are lengthier, more complex, and typically require the sale of the entire property. Secondly, blockchain technology and smart contracts can streamline the transaction process, reducing the need for intermediaries, cutting down on transaction times and costs, and enabling a 24/7 global market for tokenized assets with the right framework. These increased efficiencies could have the knock on effect of making the markets for tokenized assets more attractive to investors, thereby increasing the value of the underlying assets.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Security and transparency</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchain technology can bring increased security and transparency to tokenized assets. Blockchains’ decentralized nature makes them immune to tampering, giving investors confidence in the integrity of their holdings and transactions comparable to or even greater than what they have now. Furthermore, the transparency of blockchains can reduce the risk of fraud in tokenized asset markets — the holdings and transactions of all wallets are visible and updated in real time, so any sale or transfer would be easy to identify and evaluate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, it’s no secret that cryptocurrency projects have faced security challenges even though the underlying blockchains generally remain safe, mainly in the form of </span><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/crypto-hacking-stolen-funds-2024/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">hacks of DeFi protocols</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that have led to the theft of billions of dollars’ worth of crypto assets. Will tokenized assets fall victim to the same problems? Not necessarily. Innovations in digital asset security, such as improved </span><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/podcast-ep-47-smart-contract-audits/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">smart contract audits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, can address these problems and help cut down on hacking activity. Additionally, many traditional finance participants will likely opt to deploy tokenized assets on </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/learn/permissioned-blockchain-vs-permissionless-blockchain-key-differences"><span style="font-weight: 400;">permissioned blockchains</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which despite reducing decentralization and trustlessness, would likely be more resistant to hacking attempts and other forms of malicious activity. </span></p>
<h2 id="cases"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asset tokenization use cases</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tokenization of real world assets can improve markets for several different asset classes. Let’s look at a few below.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tokenized real estate</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Real estate is one of the most promising and frequently discussed examples of an asset that can benefit from tokenization, which is why we’ve used it for so many of our examples throughout this article. Real estate transactions often require a combination of money up front and substantial loans since the purchases are typically quite large. By tokenizing real estate assets, investors can buy or sell shares in individual properties much more easily, in more granular sizes and with less need for intermediaries. Tokenization of commercial real estate, for example, could make investment in high-value properties far more accessible to a wider range of investors and introduce more liquidity into a market traditionally known for its lack of liquidity. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tokenized bonds</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tokenization of bonds is another promising example of asset tokenization, and one that has </span><a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/tokenized-us-treasuries-845-market-cap-2023-coingecko"><span style="font-weight: 400;">already gained steam</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Tokenization can streamline the bond issuance process and automate several aspects of bond management, such as interest payments and maturity settlements. That, along with other benefits like reduction of intermediaries and lowered transaction costs, could make bond markets more efficient and accessible. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tokenized carbon credits</span></h3>
<p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/carbon_credit.asp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Carbon credits</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are financial instruments that represent a business’ successful reduction in carbon emissions by a specific amount, usually issued in the context of laws demanding companies in a given country or region collectively reduce emissions to a targeted overall level. Carbon credits can be traded like any other financial instrument — companies who don’t actually reduce their emissions can buy carbon credits from those that have, essentially allowing them to pay to reduce their on-paper environmental impact and meet their emissions requirements under the law. Tokenization of carbon credits could enhance the transparency and efficiency of the carbon credit market, and also make it  easier for smaller companies to buy and sell credits given the fractionalization of credits that tokenization could enable. Overall, this approach has the potential to create new opportunities within the green economy by increasing the pool of possible participants.  </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Other examples of real world asset tokenization</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Tokenization can be applied to virtually any asset class, no matter how niche, as long as a market exists for it. For instance, intellectual property in the form of patents and copyrights could be tokenized, giving artists and inventors new ways of monetizing their creations. Unique collectibles like classic cars, luxury yachts, pieces of rare art, vintage wines — all of these present opportunities for tokenization as well. In all cases, the primary benefits are democratization of access, increased transparency, and the fostering of bigger, more liquid markets. </span></p>
<h2 id="risks"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Risks and challenges of asset tokenization</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While asset tokenization presents numerous potential benefits, there are also risks and challenges that must be addressed, as is the case with any emerging technology. Let’s look at a few below.</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Regulatory uncertainty.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The future of digital asset regulation is uncertain in many parts of the world, </span><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2023/06/19/crypto-market-regulatory-uncertainty-overshadows-blockchain-development-bank-of-america/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">including the United States</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Among other unknowns, that uncertainty can create risks for prospective issuers and purchasers of tokenized assets, particularly in cases allowing cross-border transactions where multiple jurisdictions are involved.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Market adoption and liquidity.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tokenized assets’ promises of increased liquidity are premised on widespread market adoption. Without investor trust in tokenized assets and blockchain technology more broadly, as well as the necessary infrastructure, this may not happen. Investors attempting to tokenize assets today may find it difficult to establish a robust market immediately.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Current security risks.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> As we discussed earlier, the some crypto projects face security threats today, mostly related to the hacking of DeFi protocols. While financial institutions tokenizing assets could take steps to mitigate these concerns, such as by employing private blockchains, these steps would likely require tradeoffs on characteristics like openness and decentralization, potentially reducing the benefits of asset tokenization.  </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Operational complexity.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Tokenization of assets introduces new, complex processes around the integration of traditional asset management tactics with emerging blockchain technologies. This can lead to operational challenges — investors and issuers would likely need robust wallet infrastructure to manage their tokenized assets, different from the technologies they use today. </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Valuation concerns.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The valuation of tokenized assets, particularly in niche asset classes or those currently without well-established, liquid markets, could be challenging. This may lead to unexpected volatility or pricing discrepancies, potentially impacting investor returns and market stability.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>The education gap.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Lastly, there is a significant educational gap in the market. Many potential investors and participants in the tokenization ecosystem are not fully aware of how it works, its benefits, and its risks. Overcoming this knowledge barrier is crucial for the widespread adoption and success of asset tokenization.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While challenges associated with asset tokenization are non-trivial, they’re solvable with the right strategies and advancement in both technology and regulation associated with digital assets. The ongoing integration of traditional finance and digital assets, one example of which we see in the recent momentum on establishment of ETFs devoted to crypto assets like Bitcoin, suggests the appetite to solve many of these problems exists and is robust. Overall, the key to overcoming these challenges is collaboration between blockchain technology experts, traditional finance leaders, and regulators, to ensure that asset tokenization can move forward productively and safely. Education of potential investors and other market participants on the benefits and challenges of asset tokenization is also essential. Ultimately though, if all stakeholders can agree that the potential benefits of asset tokenization outweigh these challenges, we’re likely to see progress on solving them. </span></p>
<h2 id="examples"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asset tokenization today: Examples of active projects</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are several asset tokenization projects underway today, from both crypto native and traditional finance businesses. Let’s look at a few below. </span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Securitize.</b> <a href="https://securitize.io/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Securitize</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a prominent company in the asset tokenization space, using the Ethereum blockchain to issue various types of security tokens.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Ondo Finance.</b> <a href="https://ondo.finance/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ondo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> offers access to tokenized tradfi assets, such as short-term U.S. Treasuries via its on-chain </span><a href="https://ondo.finance/ousg"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ondo Short-Term US Government Bond Fund</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></li>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Goldman Sachs.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Goldman Sachs recently launched its </span><a href="https://developer.gs.com/discover/gs-dap"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital Assets Platform</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230110005308/en/Goldman-Sachs%E2%80%99-Tokenization-Platform-GS-DAP%E2%84%A2-Leveraging-Daml-Goes-Live">partnership</a> with blockchain software provider </span><a href="https://www.digitalasset.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Digital Asset</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Using Digital Asset’s purpose-built Canton Network blockchain, Goldman Sachs’ platform can facilitate the issuance, registration, settlement, and custody of various tokenized assets.</span></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These are just a few of the asset tokenization projects in motion today. Many others have launched or are in development, and many more are likely to follow in the coming years. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asset tokenization is an area to watch</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asset tokenization is one of the most exciting areas of blockchain technology, and one that many expect to grow in the near future. While challenges remain, asset tokenization has the potential to merge the new world of the crypto economy with the old world of traditional finance, giving more people the opportunity to invest in assets currently not available to them, while also enhancing market efficiency. </span></p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。<br />美国财政部的外国资产控制办公室（OFAC）制裁了俄罗斯国民伊利亚·安德烈维奇·甘巴希兹和尼古拉·亚历山德罗维奇·图皮金，以及他们的公司，因协助俄罗斯政府进行外国恶意活动。这不是OFAC第一次针对涉及加密货币的俄罗斯国民采取行动。OFAC还指定了两个USDT地址，并Tether已冻结甘巴希兹的钱包。文章详细介绍了甘巴希兹和图皮金的运作及其USDT地址的活动。 <div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On March 20, 2024, the United States Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) </span><a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-rleases/jy2195"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sanctioned</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Russian nationals Ilya Andreevich Gambashidze and Nikolai Aleksandrovich Tupikin, and their respective companies for assisting the Government of the Russian Federation in foreign malign campaigns, including deceiving voters around the world to undermine trust in their governments. OFAC included two USDT addresses in this designation, and Tether has since frozen Gambashidze’s wallets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This isn’t the first time OFAC has taken action against Russian nationals involved in disinformation campaigns where cryptocurrency was involved. </span><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/ofac-fbi-russian-influence-synthetic-identity-document-vendor-sanctions/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In April 2021</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for instance, OFAC designated SouthFront, a disinformation outlet linked to the Federal Security Service (FSB). OFAC also designated The Association for Free Research and International Cooperation (AFRIC), a Yevgeniy Prigozhin front company affiliated with the Internet Research Agency (IRA), </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/14/europe/russia-yevgeny-prigozhin-internet-research-agency-intl/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">a well-known Russian troll farm</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> involved in interfering with the 2016 presidential election.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this blog, we’ll explore Gambashidze’s and Tupikin’s operations, including the on-chain activities of their USDT addresses included in today’s OFAC designation. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why OFAC sanctioned Gambashidze and Tupikin</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gambashidze is the founder of Russia-based Social Design Agency and Tupikin is the CEO of Russia-based Company Group Structura, LLC. Both of their companies have hired individuals to spread disinformation regarding foreign elections and political conflicts, often at the direction of the Russian government. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Through combined efforts, the sanctioned individuals tried to influence a foreign election by impersonating European media outlets and government organizations. According to OFAC, toward the end of 2022, Gambashidze and Tupikin had created more than 60 websites to impersonate these organizations, and promoted the sites on social media with the goal of deceiving campaign voters. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gambashidze in particular has a history of </span><a href="https://www.france24.com/en/europe/20240228-ilya-gambashidze-simple-soldier-of-disinformation-or-king-of-russia-s-trolls"><span style="font-weight: 400;">facilitating disinformation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to increase Russia’s foreign influence. In 2023, the Council of the European Union added him to its </span><a href="https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST-11607-2023-INIT/en/pdf%20%20By%20Novemb"><span style="font-weight: 400;">list of sanctioned individuals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for targeting voters in Ukraine and several Western Europe countries. Soon after, he appeared on the U.S. State Department’s radar for </span><a href="https://www.state.gov/the-kremlins-efforts-to-covertly-spread-disinformation-in-latin-america/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">spreading false information across Latin America</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, then turned to propaganda related to the Israel-Hamas war.  </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gambashidze’s on-chain activities</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OFAC included </span><a href="https://ofac.treasury.gov/recent-actions/20240320"><span style="font-weight: 400;">two USDT (on the TRON network) addresses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> associated with Gambashidze: </span></p>
<ul>

<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">TMGLqRQ4twjW8wJhVH1mQR7nUThpGHUsN3</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The </span><a href="http://reactor.chainalysis.com"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chainalysis Reactor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> graph below shows that Gambashidze’s wallets received more than $200,000 worth of USDT on the TRON network, a significant portion of which came directly from previously-sanctioned Russian exchange </span><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/hydra-garantex-ofac-sanctions-russia/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Garantex</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. He then cashed out most of his funds to a single deposit address at a mainstream exchange. These transactions highlight Garantex’s </span><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2022-crypto-crime-report-preview-russia-ransomware-money-laundering/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">continued involvement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the Russian government’s illicit activities. </span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Monitoring Russia’s crypto-related activities</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">OFAC’s designations today illustrate its commitment to safeguarding United States citizens from illicit actors, disrupting the spread of disinformation and preserving election integrity across the globe. Additionally, we commend Tether for taking quick action in freezing Gambashidze’s wallets to protect the ecosystem from potential exposure to the two addresses. We have labeled the relevant addresses as associated with the sanctioned entity in our product suite. </span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public Key Episode 99: Crypto market manipulation being coordinated by dark web group</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">With Bitcoin reaching all-time highs we thought it would be best for us to revisit one of our most downloaded episodes on Public Key discussing Crypto Market Manipulation, with former Flashpoint founder, </span><a href="https://x.com/IntelTweet?s=20"><b>Evan Kohlmann</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://twitter.com/IanAndrewsDC"><b>Ian Andrews </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">(CMO, Chainalysis).  Evan is now the Founder and CEO of </span><a href="https://burst.cloud/"><b>Cloudburst Technologies</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a company tasked with scraping the dark web to identify potential pump and dump schemes and the associated illicit actors. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the episode recorded in February 2023, Evan explains the nuances of these targeted market manipulation attacks, who the orchestrators are, and the countries being targeted. He explains how his team’s technology can gather KYC information and shed some light on the extent these schemes have on the total illicit activity in the industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Evan even records an update to this episode highlighting the sudden rise or crypto prices, what are the biggest market manipulation concerns for 2024 and new data that his team is seeing that the general public should be aware of. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quote of the episode</span></h2>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“There is $120 billion of volume per year that&#8217;s being sucked out by online crypto pumps and dumps&#8230;That is six times the money that is lost in ransomware.” </span></i><b><i>&#8211; Evan Kohlmann (Founder, CEO, Cloudburst Technologies)</i></b></p>

<title>2023 Cryptocurrency Gains by Country</title>
<link>https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/cryptocurrency-gains-by-country-2023/</link>
<guid>https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/cryptocurrency-gains-by-country-2023/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。2023年是加密货币市场恢复的一年，预计投资者在2023年获得了376亿美元的加密货币收益。美国以93.6亿美元的收益居首，英国以13.9亿美元位列第二，亚洲国家如越南、中国、印度尽管属于低中等收入国家，但也获得了十分可观的收益。展望2024年，若持续正面趋势，预计将获得类似于2021年的收益水平。 <div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2023 was a year of recovery for cryptocurrency markets, with asset prices and market sentiment improving over the course of the year after a challenging 2022. But how well did investors actually fare? In this blog, we share our 2023 estimates of crypto gains based on investors’ interactions with centralized exchanges, including a breakdown of estimated gains by country. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our methodology: How we calculate cryptocurrency gains and estimate gains by country</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use on-chain data to estimate investors’ cryptocurrency gains based on movements of crypto assets in and out of services where they can be on or off-ramped into fiat currency. Specifically, we start by measuring the on-chain, macro-level flows of a select group of assets that account for approximately 80% of total market capitalization for all cryptocurrencies, and which are traded on major centralized exchanges offering crypto-to-fiat conversion. Then, we estimate the total, collective gains made on each asset by measuring the differences between the U.S. dollar value of all withdrawals of the asset and the value of all deposits of the asset. The methodology rests on the fact that any deposit to a service offering off-ramping represents a potential conversion into cash, and therefore realization of any gains or losses on the asset. While the methodology isn’t perfect, it gives us a strong estimate of gains across popular assets traded on centralized exchanges. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Once we estimate gains on crypto assets for users of each service we track using this methodology, we distribute those gains to individual countries based on the share of web traffic each country represents for each service’s website. This combination of transaction data and web traffic is also the same framework we use to calculate our yearly </span><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2023-global-crypto-adoption-index/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Global Crypto Adoption Index</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2023 estimated total cryptocurrency gains</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, we estimate that all crypto investors achieved total gains of $37.6 billion in 2023.</span></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-12979" height="368" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/gains-1-800x368.png" width="800" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While this total is much smaller than the $159.7 billion in gains made during the 2021 bull market, it represents a significant recovery from 2022, which saw estimated losses of $127.1 billion. Interestingly, our total gains estimate for 2023 is lower than 2021, despite crypto asset prices growing at similar rates in each of those two years. One possible explanation for this could be that investors in 2023 were less likely to convert crypto assets into cash, under the expectation that prices would rise even higher given that they didn&#8217;t surpass previous all-time highs at any point in 2023, unlike in 2021.  </span></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-12980" height="381" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/gains-2-monthly-800x381.png" width="800" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto gains were relatively consistent throughout the year before two straight months of losses in August and September. Gains rose sharply after that, with November and December dwarfing all previous months. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2023 estimated cryptocurrency gains by country</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The United States led the way in cryptocurrency gains by a wide margin in 2023 at an estimated $9.36 billion. The UK placed second with an estimated $1.39 billion in crypto gains.</span></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-12981" height="963" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/gains-3-countries-800x963.png" width="800" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interestingly, we also see several </span><a href="https://blogs.worldbank.org/opendata/new-world-bank-country-classifications-income-level-2022-2023"><span style="font-weight: 400;">upper and lower middle income countries</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> whose residents appear to have achieved outsized gains, especially in Asia — Vietnam, China, Indonesia, and India, for example, all hit over $1 billion in estimated gains, and place in the top six for all countries. We previously noted in our </span><a href="https://go.chainalysis.com/geography-of-cryptocurrency-2023.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2023 Geography of Cryptocurrency Report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that countries in these income categories, and lower middle income countries in particular, showed strong cryptocurrency adoption that remained notably resilient even through the recent bear market. Our gains estimates suggest that many investors in those countries have benefited from their embrace of the asset class. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What could 2024 have in store?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far, the positive trends of 2023 have carried over into 2024, with notable crypto assets like Bitcoin achieving all-time highs in the wake of Bitcoin ETF approvals and increased institutional adoption. If these trends continue, we may see gains more in line with those we saw in 2021. As of March 13, Bitcoin is up 65.4% and Ether is up 70.2% in 2024.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Public Key Episode 98: The Complex World of Crypto Romance / Investment Scams</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week we’ve got a special episode for you. Over the nearly two years since we started the podcast one of our most frequent topics has been the crypto romance / investment scam known as </span><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/pig-butchering-human-trafficking/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pig Butchering</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a Public Key first </span><a href="https://twitter.com/IanAndrewsDC"><b>Ian Andrews </b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">(CMO, Chainalysis)  highlight impactful statements from past guests, including: </span><a href="http://linkedin.com/in/erinnordbywest"><b>Erin West</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="http://linkedin.com/in/alonakatz"><b>Alona Katz</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://x.com/AlMcCready1?s=20"><b>Alastair McCready</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicola-staub/"><b>Nicola Staub</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Detective </span><a href="http://linkedin.com/in/detmatthew-hogancsp"><b>Matthew Hogan</b></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, who discuss the scam’s exponential growth, with Southeast Asia emerging as a hotbed for these criminal operations. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The guests emphasize that these crimes are not isolated incidents but part of an organized crime network with ties to human trafficking and forced labor, generating billions in stolen funds annually.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group covers the basics of pig butchering, tactics used by international criminals, challenges in combating the crime, and how collaboration and educational awareness are key solutions to preventing this complex crime. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alastair highlights the neglect by authorities in countries housing these pig butchering scam compounds, while the remaining guests explain how public-private  partnerships have been the key to info-sharing and collaboration of resources. </span></p>
<h3><b>Quote of the episode</b></h3>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;The more I look into this, the more I realize that it&#8217;s way more than pig butchering. What we&#8217;re seeing is transnational organized crime that is being perpetuated on an industrial level. We are seeing these criminals who have had over 5 years to entrench themselves in Southeast Asia, building massive compounds, infrastructure, organized ways of doing business. So our fight is more important than ever.&#8221;  </span></i><b><i>&#8211; Erin West (Deputy District Attorney, Santa Clara County)</i></b></p>

<h3><b>Quote of the episode</b></h3>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8220;One cool thing that blockchain analytics allows us to do is, when the entire business model is moving onto the blockchain, then every transaction that&#8217;s happening to underpin a ransomware attack, we know about. So we know funds going to initial access brokers, which we&#8217;ve identified. We know funds going to VPN services.&#8221; </span></i><b><i>&#8211; Kim Grauer (Director of Research, Chainalysis)</i></b></p>

<h2><b>Transcript</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All right. Hey everyone, welcome to another episode of Public Key. This is one of my favorite episodes of the year, and actually one of the most popular episodes we&#8217;ve done the last two years. It is our breakdown of the annual Chainalysis Crypto crime report. Today I&#8217;m joined by my colleagues and friends, Kim Grauer, our head of research and Eric Jardine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hello.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eric:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hello everyone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Welcome to the program. It is a big time of year for your team. I know you&#8217;ve been grinding on this report for months. By the time this episode airs, I think we will have published the full report so people will be able to go and download it. They can read the hundreds of pages of details, but I love this episode because we get to dive into some of the more interesting stories and trends. I&#8217;m really curious, what was the most surprising or interesting thing you discovered as you were going about building a report? Eric, let&#8217;s start with you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eric:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure. Yeah. It&#8217;s always tricky to take something of this scope and scale and be like, &#8220;Let&#8217;s just name one thing.&#8221; So I&#8217;m going to finesse the answer a smidge by saying, you said surprising and or interesting. So I&#8217;ll say one of each. On the surprising front, what struck me the most is &#8220;Huh. I didn&#8217;t see that coming,&#8221; was the gradual resurgence of Tornado Cash, the ETH based smart contract mixer. I think it struck me as odd, didn&#8217;t see it coming. A lot of discussions of sanctions gets dominated by other entities, but that one has increasingly seen more and more inflows, and that&#8217;s unexpected. And on the interesting front, I think the big resurgence in ransomware really stood out to me as well, that cresting a billion for the first time was quite a significant milestone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Awesome. Well, that&#8217;s a great setup for the rest of the episode because we&#8217;re going to talk more about ransomware and more about sanctions. Kim, what about you? Interesting or unexpected that came through in the research cycle?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, definitely the wildest moment was when we ran the final numbers for ransomware and saw that we had hit an all time high. And I remember because it was like a head to head with the previous year, and we got a fresh surge of ransomware addresses, and we were at all time highs. And I think that&#8217;s when we realized we had been focusing really heavily on other sections on hacking, on North Korea on money laundering. And that&#8217;s when we realized that ransomware is a really big part of the story this year, and maybe something that people aren&#8217;t talking about. So I really like when the crime report highlights something that is not broadly discussed, and it shows that our data can surface insights that are happening that maybe were going, flying under the radar. And that definitely happened with ransomware. I think on the flip side, what we saw with hacking was that it was going down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And I think that also surprised people, because we are used to being in this industry where every day there&#8217;s a hack, it&#8217;s so unsafe. And so to see that narrative turn around was really exciting as well. And then I&#8217;m, of course, going to plug the market manipulation section, which is my favorite section, where we were, for reasons that aren&#8217;t really results-based, but more methods-based, but we were able to show that a pretty big percentage of the newly launched tokens are associated with some patterns that look suspicious, but that only represents a small fraction of the total trading volume. So three fun points I think that I enjoyed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazing. We&#8217;re going to talk more about all three of those. I think we should jump in to ransomware so that we don&#8217;t bury the lede here. Eric, the big headline this year, more than a billion dollars in funds paid in ransom. First time that we&#8217;ve ever seen in excess of a billion dollars going to ransomware rings. It was also a huge change in trajectory. We had called 2021 the year of ransomware. That was the year in which Colonial Pipeline got shut down here in the United States. There were also a number of other pretty notorious hacks. 2022, I think surprised us because it was down materially, but obviously 2023 has come back with a vengeance. Maybe start with a bit of speculation. What&#8217;s behind the shift in trajectory that we&#8217;re observing?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eric:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, I think about it as almost 2023 reverted back to what the longer term trend in ransomware happens to be. That if you look at it over a multi-year period, the line&#8217;s up and to the right. And 2022 is certainly anomalous in this respect. It was a big drop. And as the year we&#8217;re on, and into this year, we actually I think started to get a glimpse at what was maybe driving some of that change in activity. And one, so you had, I think a perfect storm for a reduced amount of ransomware. So in the early half of the year, you had Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine that led to a change in tactical approach, people doing other things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then in the second half of the year, unbeknownst to most, until January, when the FBI announced it publicly, the FBI had actually infiltrated one of the major strains called Hive. And they were essentially providing decrypter keys to victims so that they would be able to avert ransoms. And so one of the things we were able to quantify, this time around in the report, was just how big of an effect that might be. And the FBI had provided a conservative estimate at the time that they announced the close of their operation. They said that they knew or had knowledge of about 130 million worth of averted ransoms in 2022. And our estimate puts it at a significantly higher number than that, tens of millions more, most likely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So the knock on effects of getting into one of the major strains and disrupting their activity is quite significant, and a really good approach for law enforcement interventions in the future. But that was happening basically from the middle of 2022 into the early part of 2023. So there&#8217;s this whole drag put onto the ransomware ecosystem during that year that was unknown until it was made public. Certainly the disruptive effects were apparent, but what was driving it was not. And so as we see this resurge back, it&#8217;s basically when you start to remove some of those forces of drag from ransomware actors, they&#8217;re rubber banding back to where the trend sort of suggested they might&#8217;ve ended up. Unfortunately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And you bring up an interesting point talking about Hive. One of the things that strikes me when I think about the ransomware landscape versus one of the other big we&#8217;ll talk about which is stolen funds, is that it seems like there&#8217;s&#8230; There&#8217;s a couple of groups we talk about pretty consistently, like the North Korean Lazarus group, who is notorious in the world of stolen funds. It seems like ransomware, it&#8217;s a much more dynamic ecosystem of actors that we&#8217;re dealing with, where groups form and then they dissolve and they might merge, or they might be infiltrated by the FBI. And even if law enforcement and technologists are successful at halting a particular strain, a new one will emerge fairly quickly that fills the void that&#8217;s been left. Can you talk a little bit about what we saw in terms of the mix of different actors that are involved here? Are there any that we should be particularly on the lookout for as we head into 2024?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eric:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, so I think you&#8217;re absolutely right at a diagnostic level, you have the ability to change strains, you have the ability to modify strains. And we do see that. One interesting example is the Black Basta ransomware. It was reliant on Qbot, which had a&#8230; Or QuackBot, which had another infiltration that was announced in August of this year, and it was basically shut down. But basically you find a different delivery mechanism, which Black Basta did, and then you get a resurgence of activity later in the period of 2023. So this adaptability is fairly challenging. And then from an on-chain dimension, on-chain infrastructure is highly recyclable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can use it once, you can jettison it from there, which makes tracking, identification, these sorts of things, quite a challenge. So I think there&#8217;s a few groups that are, they closed out the year pretty strongly, including ones like Black Basta and the big players that are doing the lion&#8217;s share, I&#8217;d say of the ransomware activity at a dollar denominated level, that you really want to be watching out for, because there isn&#8217;t unfortunately a really effective permanent solution here. You disrupt their delivery mechanism, they adapt. You disrupt their on-chain infrastructure, they adapt. You infiltrate the strain, it will eventually regrow, unfortunately. A little bit like a hydra.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Interesting. One of the things that keeps coming up is ransomware as a service, which seems like maybe that&#8217;s proliferating the availability of the tools necessary to carry out a ransomware attack so we get more smaller actors. Am I interpreting that right, or is the ecosystem maybe not quite that heterogeneous?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eric:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think, yeah, there&#8217;s a big spectrum with ransomware as a service. So you have some, where you&#8217;re at the small end of the medium ransom payments, you may be conducting a fair number of attacks, but you&#8217;re not getting a lot for them. And you can range from there up into the alpha predator side of things where your strains associated with some of the larger attacks that we might observe during the course of the year. This affiliate model, where people are signing in to use your ransomware strain basically does proliferate the&#8230; Think about it this way, it lowers the bar for what you need in order to do ransomware because you don&#8217;t need to be the admin designing it and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And from there, you can basically work with access brokers to get into networks. You deliver the payload, you take receipt and you get paid. And that&#8217;s a model that&#8217;s right for people who are, strictly speaking, just financially motivated, but may lack skills in some of these other areas. So it definitely lowers the bar for participation, which can create a proliferation of actors across the ecosystem. But there is a big range. Some of them are pretty straightforward, some of them are far more complex. So there&#8217;s some nuances there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will say on the flip side of ransomware as service, one cool thing that blockchain analytics allows us to do is when the entire business model is moving onto the blockchain, then every transaction that&#8217;s happening to underpin a ransomware attack, we know about. So we know funds going to initial access brokers, which we&#8217;ve identified. We know funds going to VPN services. And Eric, actually, one of the cool things that he did was look at the relationship between investment by ransomware strains in things like infrastructure to carry out an attack, initial access, broker access, and then the predictability of when a ransomware attack is going to happen. So even though it&#8217;s scaling ransomware operations at such a high rate, now you can just buy access. You don&#8217;t have to be the person who&#8217;s building the attack. You can dabble in different ransomware strains.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s also giving a lot of opportunities to law enforcement to model out exactly the entire business model of a ransomware attack, and see where funds are going, what it takes to carry out a ransomware attack. And crucially, what we&#8217;ve talked about at Chainalysis, which is the supply chain, the supply chain of the ransomware attack, more opportunities to disrupt the ransomware operator. So if there&#8217;s an operator in a jurisdiction that maybe you don&#8217;t have jurisdiction over, maybe there&#8217;s someone in your jurisdiction that is a part of this whole supply chain of ransomware attacks. So our investigators are really great at modeling out all of the components of ransomware when you do go from just an individual run ransomware to this whole business model, that ransomware as a service is, blows open the door for investigations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It really is powerful, the visibility that we get into the entire business once everything&#8217;s conducted in cryptocurrency. It&#8217;s such a powerful tool in the toolbox of law enforcement and other cybersecurity investigators. I&#8217;m curious, actually, you said supply chain. I&#8217;m going to take that in a slightly different direction, because it seemed like in 2023, supply chain attacks were at the core of so much of the really big, notorious attacks that we saw. This compromise of MOVEit was one that just stuck with me all year because it&#8217;s a piece of software that&#8217;s on so many devices all around the world, very common IT administrative tooling. And once their infrastructure was compromised, this just exposed so many companies to vulnerabilities and ultimately attack. I&#8217;m curious, how much are we seeing that type of supply chain vulnerability as contrasted to something more of a run-of-the-mill of credential theft or individual user compromise? Do we have any sense of the breakdown between those two?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eric:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">From my standpoint, not at a frequency level other than I would hazard things like MOVEit are rarer. That&#8217;s one of the only upsides of zero days is, to a degree, fewer and far between as opposed to compromising somebody&#8217;s credentials in order to gain partial or full access to a system. At an effect size level, we looked a little bit at the effect of MOVEit, particularly on inflows to a particular strain wallet associated with the CLOP ransomware, which was leveraging that particular vulnerability, and it jumped in terms of its inflow proportion relative to the whole, during the months that it was active in this regard. It was upwards 30 to 40% of all ransomware inflows in those couple month periods were associated with CLOP because it was taking advantage of how ubiquitous MOVEit happened to be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So those are the doomsday scenarios, where you find this little known who probably could have named MOVEit before it became a thing. It was everywhere, but nobody&#8230; It was so latent in the infrastructure stack that people just didn&#8217;t really know it was there. And it&#8217;s the worst case scenario when a ransomware actor gets a hold of a vulnerability because it&#8217;s everywhere. Nobody knows it&#8217;s there. Cleanup takes a long time getting it figured out and patched, and all the rest. So certainly I think those vulnerabilities are luckily fewer and far between other methods of potentially gaining access, I would hazard. But when they are found and exploited, it&#8217;s a mess, no doubt about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It certainly made me want to go delete everything off all my devices that I don&#8217;t use regularly that it&#8217;s absolutely necessary to be there. I was like you, I had never heard of MOVEit until I heard about MOVEit. So last question on ransomware. I&#8217;m curious, where are all the funds going? A billion dollars is a lot of money. I know that&#8217;s not to one organization or just one individual, obviously, but where are the funds going after they&#8217;re ransomed from victims? A few years ago we were, I think, all very happy to see us Treasury, OFAC, take action against one of the more popular money laundering organizations that was supporting the ransomware activity. Has a new player emerged post that sanctions activity that most of this is consolidating through, or have they taken different tactics entirely since then?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eric:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think that there&#8217;s some interesting changes to the off-ramping or laundering pattern that we were observing on-chain. One is I think there&#8217;s increasingly these episodic periods where ransomware actors lean into things they haven&#8217;t tried before. Mining pools, cross-chain bridges, things like that. The go-tos are usually exchanges, underground laundering services or mixers are the big categories of things that we&#8217;ll receive funds. But there&#8217;s definitely&#8230; There are dynamic actors in this space and they&#8217;re trying out these alternatives, things they can effectively launder but haven&#8217;t really been something we&#8217;ve observed before, but we&#8217;re seeing it pop here and there. It&#8217;ll be like one quarter worth where all of a sudden cross-chain bridges become the thing that they&#8217;re trying, or gambling services on a lower denomination basis, stuff like that. So I would interpret it as the ransomware actors in the ecosystem are certainly not staying flat-footed, and they&#8217;re definitely just trying out other methods for laundering funds, probably with AI towards just seeing what the most effective pathway happens to be at the given moment, rather than any innate desire to use a cross-chain bridge or something like that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They&#8217;re doing it for a reason, to try to avoid detection, for sure. But it&#8217;s an interesting dynamic because it shows that they&#8217;re definitely not just&#8230; Well, I&#8217;d interpret it this way. It&#8217;s an interesting dynamic because it definitely shows that they don&#8217;t think the current approach to things is sufficient going forward. Because the more they&#8217;re trying out and cycling through new things, the more it must be that they&#8217;re feeling some pressure to try to launder funds more effectively, and are feeling things like sanctioning events or closures or frozen funds or whatever it happens to be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And I would imagine&#8230; Go ahead, Kim.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sorry. There was one really unique way that ransomware shined from the rest of the crime types when it comes to money laundering, and that is in addition to experimenting with bridges, and mixers are obviously a big part of the picture, the new mixers, the old mixers, but there&#8217;s a lot of use of informal or homegrown built money laundering infrastructure that feeds into really large deposit addresses on low KYC exchanges. And a lot of the other crime types were adapting this year to the fact that we can see everything going on to the deposit addresses. So we saw most crime types were diversifying across multiple deposit addresses, except ransomware, which started going all in on these really big deposit addresses. So using more concentrated off-ramps, fiat off-ramps, to move their funds. We&#8217;ve speculated as to why that is, but it&#8217;s really unique to ransomware, and a reversing trend across every other type of crime, who are moving away from leveraging these really easy to see large deposit addresses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you think that&#8217;s a nested exchange where they have some controlling interest maybe in an operating entity that&#8217;s then nested inside of a larger exchange that&#8217;s looking the other way? Can you speculate more as to what&#8217;s driving that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So the term nested service is, I&#8217;ve always found it to be difficult to get concrete about, because are you talking about is it a known service with it&#8217;s filed its papers, or is it just someone who&#8217;s doing a business that&#8217;s just informally? At what point do you become a nested service versus just someone who&#8217;s just carrying out their money laundering operations that&#8217;s scaling? And so I think the line there is a little bit gray. I would say that it is in that domain, someone professionally moving money. And do they do other stuff besides ransomware? Well, we can look at the deposit address and see the exposure and answer that, and I&#8217;m reluctant to share some of what we&#8217;ve seen now. But you can get a sense of that, okay, this is a business operation. Are they registered? What have they told to exchange? Does the exchange care? Those are different questions. But if you&#8217;re moving that amount of ransomware money, it&#8217;s definitely going to be at a business scale.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah. Fascinating. It&#8217;s something we&#8217;re going to have to keep an eye on. I don&#8217;t suspect that the ransomware trend line we&#8217;ve observed in 23 is going to slow down at all. So I think we will have more to say on that topic. Shifting gears a little bit, Kim, one of the things that blew me away, looking at the research this year, was the total amount stolen from crypto platforms fell dramatically year over year. We&#8217;re talking from over 3 billion stolen in 2022 down to just a bit over a billion last year. The number of incidents decreased slightly year over year. I am curious how to interpret this. Are DeFi platforms getting safer, or is maybe hacking them getting less lucrative for some reason? I know TVL is down year over year as well. What do you think? What&#8217;s the big takeaway we should put behind those numbers?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, Eric will know that we have a different opinion about this. So my-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ooh. Controversy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will let him characterize his opinion, but I am in the camp that DeFi is getting safer. And if you look at the types of attacks that are happening, or at least the DeFi attack vectors that we saw in the past that were taking advantage of on-chain vulnerabilities and smart contract vulnerabilities, are the share in the second half of 2023 of all attacks that were more in the line of phishing or compromised keys, grew a lot. And then the share of the attacks that were smart contract on-chain exploitations declined a lot. And so I&#8217;m seeing signals that some of the on-chain vulnerabilities, we&#8217;re cleaning up the ship a little bit. And our hypothesis for two years now has been that can&#8217;t go on for the industry. We can&#8217;t have that many smart contract vulnerabilities that people are actively using and storing their funds in. Of course, that&#8217;s a hard problem to overcome. And then we also saw a lot of price manipulation, which is a different type of attack vector, but Eric, I think when we talked about this, has been in the gets lower TVL camp.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, Eric, give us the counterpoint here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eric:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All right. So first off, they&#8217;re not mutually exclusive, so I definitely lean one direction, but I do recognize that you can have improved security and reduced TVL and they both contribute some proportion, and I think that&#8217;s probably what&#8217;s happening. But no, I&#8217;m definitely&#8230; There&#8217;s the Sutton rule, the famous bank robber, and the quote was something along the lines of when asked why did you rob banks. And he says, &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s where the money is.&#8221; And I think the distilled lesson from that is if there&#8217;s less to steal, in terms of TVL, you&#8217;d expect less in terms of stolen funds amounts in the DeFi ecosystem just as a function of that. And so I think when looking at, for example, the decline in TVL that mirrors the decline in value stolen, my initial reaction is that, yes, at least some portion of this, I think a majority portion, but this is where the difference of opinion comes in, is probably that we&#8217;re tracking that decline in value at risk, as opposed to the decline in, or as opposed to, strictly speaking, improvements in security.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What I think is interesting is just thinking about this in terms of next steps is I just saw Bitcoin, before we started here, Bitcoin cracked 50 K. Go team.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Did it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eric:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah. But if we do trend in this year or into next year, into another bull market cycle, and if TVL surges as a result of that, the two factors we&#8217;re talking about would have different of predictions for the future, and mine would be kind of a pessimistic regression back to pretty high amounts of value stolen, and the security improvements, assuming they&#8217;re sticky and assuming new entrants adopt the best practices that we&#8217;ve seen develop during the bear market, then we should see the numbers not be quite as bad as they were historically. I certainly hope that that&#8217;s the one that happens, but I think the pessimist in me suggests that I think the safer prediction is when TVL surges, stolen funds and DeFi is going to surge again too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will say, to bolster your point, is that if you look at the DPRK hacking, they&#8217;re at all-time highs for number of hacks carried out, and attributable to the Lazarus group, but it&#8217;s about half of the value from last year. But to support the reason why DeFi is actually becoming safer, and I mean, I guess the way you phrase this is important, because the DeFi native on-chain attacks are fewer, but you still and will always have phishing risks, risks associated with phishing, and that the same types of problems that impact every organization around the world are becoming prevalent and a part of this. But the DeFi vulnerabilities that are specific to bad contract, bad code, those are cleaning up a little bit. And I think that the Lazarus group&#8217;s hacks show that if you look at the way that they&#8217;re breaching and the number of attacks and the amount. So yeah, maybe we&#8217;re all right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would add to it as well, it&#8217;s not as simple as, okay, we&#8217;re writing better smart contract code. I think there&#8217;s better tooling in the ecosystem as well. We&#8217;ve seen the emergence of companies like Hyper Native that gives you real-time, security threat intelligence. They can tell you as an attack is forming against your platform and allow you to potentially take action like block an address or pause your protocol. There&#8217;s tools like Olympics that is a smart contract code editing assistant. So I think we&#8217;re getting a higher quality of infrastructure is developing, plus the best practices that you all just talked about. So it feels to me like the industry&#8217;s getting better protected, a bit smarter, but Lazarus is, by no means, slowing down. So it&#8217;s not a moment to rest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think, Kim, the other thing I caught my eye is stablecoins. When we looked at the illicit activity, it seemed like there was a spike in usage that maybe started last year in terms of stablecoins as a percentage of the overall stolen funds that were transmitted. Which strikes me as really weird. Because the two biggest stablecoin issuers by volume, both have not only the technical capability but the demonstrated history of collaborating with law enforcement. If you send a notice and say these funds are stolen or there&#8217;s something bad happened here, they will freeze those funds on-chain. So I&#8217;m obviously not a criminal, but if I try and put my criminal hat on and think like a criminal, that seems like a really bad way to go about conducting my illicit activities, to use money that can be taken out of my pocket at any moment in time. So unpack what&#8217;s going on for us a little bit with stablecoins.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s a good news for the industry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, absolutely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is. Because our next steps are obvious. And there&#8217;s a really powerful tool at our disposal of how we can handle this. So even though it is happening, and it could potentially be happening because we&#8217;re all just starting to really tap into that capability and get comfortable with using that capability. But another nuance is that we think of crypto crime, I think people immediately still think about buying drugs on the dark web and ransomware attacks, but a lot of the stablecoin activity is occurring in the sanctioned actor category. So this is entities or services that have been sanctioned by OFAC and are operating. A big one would be Garantex, it&#8217;s still operating a majority stablecoin activity because its people are trading. Stablecoins are&#8230; Underlying all of this is the fact that stablecoins are completely blowing up and everyone is using stablecoins. If you want it up into the right chart, you look at the share of all crypto activity that is denominated in stablecoins, it&#8217;s becoming the number of active wallets that are holding stablecoins is growing rapidly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So the share of that that is on these sanctioned services is also growing as a general, because of this general trend. But also because it&#8217;s not that criminals want to use stablecoins, per se, to carry out ransomware attacks or purchase drugs on dark web or something, it&#8217;s because of these services that are being sanctioned, the types of activity on many of these services, or at least the vast majority of them, are denominated in stablecoins. So it&#8217;s actually also more of a reflection of some industry shifts in how we&#8217;re thinking about crypto crime, which is that we&#8217;re looking at the share of all activity that is associated with these sanctioned entities in OFAC, and you&#8217;ll see in our sanction section, has been sanctioning services at a really fast rate. The amount of sanctioning they&#8217;re doing is growing, to the extent that we are caring about the amount of sanctioned activity that is just capturing the stablecoin, the stablecoin value.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, I think now stablecoins are like 60% of overall transactional activity, plus or minus a few percent, probably, which is amazing. That&#8217;s a huge shift from where we were a few years ago when it heavily leaned towards Bitcoin and then sort of secondarily Ethereum and then all the long tail of altcoins, stables now, well over the majority. I am curious, you brought up sanctions, which was a topic I wanted to dive into a little bit. So OFAC obviously has been much more active in recent year in terms of using sanctions as a tool to stop everything from money laundering platforms to exchanges operating in jurisdictions where there&#8217;s supporting activity that is outside of US interests. What&#8217;s our sense of sanctions as a tool to modulate activity in the world of crypto? Does it work? Kim?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Does it work? This is actually something we tackled in the crime report last year. And Eric, you actually led that research. Do you want to say what your findings were?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eric:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure. I can do a quick summary. It&#8217;s a wonderfully loaded question. Thank you. I think&#8230; My evolving take on it is they work better than I think a lot of people would think, because with a censorship resistant payment system, having an organization like OFAC, this is a sanctioned entity, it doesn&#8217;t literally stop the transfer of funds, so you&#8217;re relying on broad based compliance across the ecosystem. But what it tends to do in practice is, yeah, it seems to reduce, it reduces inflows. There&#8217;s a couple of caveats and exceptions that we can talk about, but it reduces inflows a lot of the time. Causes services to close. It disrupts the activity of the counterparties of those services.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So when an illicit actor, be it a mixer or a dark net market or whatever, when they get sanctioned, what we found last year was that the counterparties that have been relying on that infrastructure as a part of their business model, they essentially did less on-chain activity than non counterparties. So there&#8217;s this second order effect that&#8217;s at play. Interestingly, I think one of the things we&#8217;ve unearthed this year that&#8217;s caused me to modulate my view a little bit, is I think there&#8217;s a shorter term, far more severe effect, to the good, but that over time, that effect can modulate a little bit, that people, in the case of, for example, Tornado Cash, the inflow volumes dropped about 95, 96% in the immediate aftermath, but because it&#8217;s a smart contract mixer and it&#8217;s not going anywhere, volumes have ticked back up over time, which is an interesting dynamic suggesting-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do we have any sense, Eric, of who is now using Tornado Cash? I know I&#8217;m not going anywhere near it. What&#8217;s the profile of a user or maybe where are they coming from? Do we have any sense of that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eric:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do, to a degree, yeah. It&#8217;s a heavy amount of DeFi-related inflows as an origin point. And then Tornado Cash still seems to be servicing this mixture of scams and stolen funds. Not the sort of Lazarus group scale stolen fund activity that was the reason for its sanctioning in the first place, is a smaller scale than that. Likely a lot of drainers and things like that, that are at play, that are cashing out through Tornado Cash or laundering, I should say, through Tornado Cash. So it&#8217;s because of what it is, an ETH-based smart contract mixer, you&#8217;re tethered into that ecosystem pretty hard. And there are a few things that are interesting because of their absence. It doesn&#8217;t have any exposure related to Darknet markets, for example, but they&#8217;re operating in the Bitcoin silo, and except maybe through Bridges, you&#8217;re not going to be conducting business on a Darknet market and then going immediately to Tornado Cash, you have to find some in-between point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, that&#8217;s an interesting&#8230; That result from this year&#8217;s report caused me to modulate my view from last year. Because last year I was like, &#8220;These are actually far more effective than I thought they were going to be,&#8221; was my immediate reaction. If you&#8217;d asked the interesting or surprising question about last year&#8217;s report, that would have been it. These things work really well, and I still think they do. And there&#8217;s those second-order disruptive effects and everything else that I mentioned, but I think there&#8217;s this, it diminishes a little bit, not a lot. There&#8217;s still&#8230; They&#8217;re 75, 80% down from where they were before sanctioning in terms of inflows to Tornado Cash, but that effect has modulated certainly a little bit over time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What about some of the larger exchanges that we know operate out of sanctioned jurisdictions like Garantex in Russia or Novatech in Iran? Any effect that we&#8217;ve been able to observe related to sanctions in those cases?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eric:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are some negative ones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The activity is not tremendously impacted by the sanctioning event. We tend to say that the best thing to do in this scenario would be to sanction and seize a server. But I will say that even though Garantex and some of these other services are operating, business as usual, the number one thing that we get asked on the customer side is how do we protect against receiving funds from sanctioned entities? So we tag these, we have incredible attribution of these services. We know about their entire wall infrastructure and we have these identified in our product. And that on top of sanctioning being the number one concern of many customers that are wanting to safely and securely engage in crypto with cryptocurrency. I think that even if Garantex is not phased right now, there&#8217;s a long-term impact that these sanctioning events will have on some of these services. But Garantex in particular is still highly active.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, interesting. I saw that took up a pretty large share of the dollar value of the illicit activity we&#8217;re attracting this year, I think, to sanctioned entities. So something to keep an eye on. It doesn&#8217;t seem like there&#8217;s a simple answer to the strategy approach there. Eric, I know that you spend a lot of time on the dark web side of the internet, not for personal reasons, but research ones, I&#8217;m not trying to make any suggestions here. There&#8217;s been a bit of a shift in that ecosystem as well. So very large Darknet market called Hydra was shut down. I think at the peak they were doing over a billion dollars in sales a year, if I have those statistics correct. What&#8217;s happened since the shutdown of Hydra, and how&#8217;s Darknet markets as an industry going through 2023?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eric:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah. So Darknet markets and ransomware were the two non-sanction related areas that grew year over year. And in both cases you have this base rate effect that&#8217;s a part of the reason you see big changes. Now, we already talked a lot about ransomware, with the case of Darknet markets when Hydra was sanctioned and closed in early April of 2022, what basically happened was removing the biggest market in the space. It was well over 90% share of all activity. And so there&#8217;s two ways to then think about what happens next, especially into 2023. And one is we definitely saw a recovery in terms of dollar flows. So the ecosystems basically back to where it was before Hydra was sanctioned and closed. And that&#8217;s been over the longer historical period since, let&#8217;s say, 2013 when Silk Road was closed. That&#8217;s been the pattern, that there&#8217;s a drawdown in activity, but eventually growth resumes, the market size increases over time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What&#8217;s interesting this time, though, is there&#8217;s another way to look at what happens when you remove a top market, and that is what happens in terms of the dominance of any given market in this space. So how much does the top market hold? So Hydra is sitting north of 90%. That has historically been what we see, that one, maybe two markets are eating up a lion&#8217;s share of all inflows. And what&#8217;s interesting this time is since April of 2022, all the way through a full calendar year plus some, then we&#8217;ve seen a bit of a re-concentration, but it hasn&#8217;t been extreme. It&#8217;s not what we would&#8217;ve expected and not what we saw over the longer historical run. And so, one of the things we did was scratch the surface to say, &#8220;Why are we seeing a lack of concentration like we&#8217;ve seen every other time after our top market has been closed?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And in this case, what seems to be happening is basically the ecosystem&#8217;s developing now in a way that I think is best thought of as task and regional specialization. So you have some markets, Flugsvamp for example, which I think is on its fourth iteration, Incognito, ASAP, these sorts of Darknet markets that are selling drugs, but they&#8217;re doing so to Western audiences predominantly. And then you&#8217;ve got other markets that are servicing, let&#8217;s say, a global clientele, or based in servicing Eastern Europe in terms of drug exchange. And then you&#8217;ve got some markets that are actually doing something that&#8217;s closer to what you might call cyber crime enablement. So they&#8217;re receiving large amounts of funds from fraud shops or stolen funds or ransomware or stuff like that. So they&#8217;re either selling tools or they&#8217;re providing some sort of laundering, stuff of that nature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And what&#8217;s interesting about all this is you definitely see, if you start to break the data down this way, that the dominant market in any one of those categories, western facing drug markets are different in terms of which one&#8217;s dominant compared to the Russian and Eastern European ecosystem versus the global ecosystem. So that specialization&#8217;s why we&#8217;re not seeing a re-concentration, that there isn&#8217;t a global dominant market anymore. It&#8217;s like the dominant market in, let&#8217;s say, North America and Europe is this one, the dominant market in this field of activity is this one, that kind of thing. And so the lack of re-concentration, from a data standpoint, what it was interesting about it gave us a clue that let us then go look and basically see, and then trace, in fairly precise terms, who&#8217;s servicing what part of this evolving ecosystem as they take on more things and service more areas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is there an advantage from a criminal standpoint to being smaller? It seems like you&#8217;d have less of a target on your back. If you&#8217;re doing a billion dollars in revenue, everybody knows your name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eric:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yep.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whereas if you specialize in only one particular type of item and you maybe are localized to a particular jurisdiction, it just seems like you&#8217;re going to catch much, much less attention from law enforcement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eric:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That stands to reason, I think. I know that one of the things&#8230; There&#8217;s&#8230; So on the catching law enforcement attention standpoint, I don&#8217;t know the degree to which the greed of servicing multiple markets and doing so at a big scale, would weigh the risk. That&#8217;s an individual risk preference and business decision among these operators. But definitely they are aware of what factors drive, let&#8217;s say, the FBI&#8217;s attention as one of the&#8230; Since they&#8217;ve been involved in most of the major market closures. And so most of these Darknet markets have on the books terms of service prohibitions against selling fentanyl and opioids, because that&#8217;s like a surefire way to get Jcode&#8217;s attention in the FBI, which brings a lot of resources, capacity and a history of success into the equation. And so they&#8217;ll try to avoid it by just saying, &#8220;If you&#8217;re a vendor, don&#8217;t sell this.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s one of our rules. It turns out in practice, those are really terribly enforced. Most of the time that you&#8217;ll find either derivatives or component parts or street lingo that basically shows, on the face of it, vendors selling all of these products. And even the comments of customers, which they&#8217;ll leave on these effective little tiny e-commerce sites that are Darknet markets. They&#8217;ll be commenting about how it does or does not include opioids. So it&#8217;s not like it&#8217;s an enforced prohibition most of the time, but it&#8217;s definitely a pro forma nod toward trying to avoid getting in the crosshairs on the part of the FBI for sure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazing. Kim, you talked at the top about pump and dump schemes, and just this whole idea of market manipulation. It&#8217;s something that we&#8217;ve&#8230; We&#8217;ve had a couple episodes on the podcast in the last year. I think one of the companies that joined was Cloudburst. They seem to have, with pretty high confidence, identified broad market manipulation, a lot of it happening on dark web chat forums. I&#8217;m really curious, the analysis you mentioned at the top, maybe take us through what you looked at and some of the key findings there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure. Market manipulation, I think, is a really important area to focus on because, as we&#8217;ve shown in this podcast in our crime report, Chainalysis is really good at showing how much activity that is associated with wallets that you can identify as illicit, how much is happening, what percentage of all blockchain activity is there. And we&#8217;ve come a long way in assuring the public that about 1% of the blockchain is associated with this type of activity. But now we&#8217;re in this time where the big unknown is related to market integrity. Everyone thinks, &#8220;Oh, the whole market is manipulated.&#8221; And so we can do the same thing with market manipulation and be, as every transaction is available on the blockchain, we can really bring insight into how much of the blockchain activity and newly launched tokens might be illicit. So what we did in this, this is just one potential type of many ways market manipulation could occur.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We looked at what share of newly launched tokens are a little bit to have suspicious trading patterns. So with our acquisition of transpose, we were able to do this really actually pretty easily. We look at tokens that were launched in 2023, and then we create a few criteria that help us further segment out if something&#8217;s suspicious. So did the person who launched the pool remove all of the liquidity in a single transaction within a certain amount of time after the token was launched? And to get rid of noise, we do things like was there a maximum amount of liquidity that this token that was in a liquidity pool reached? Were there at least five or a certain threshold number of people transacting with the token? And then we found that of all of those tokens, 54% had some suspicious activity in the early days of the token, where the liquidity provider did remove the liquidity in one transaction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And a lot of&#8230; The journalists who came to me to talk to me about this, they were, &#8220;This is really bad for the industry, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; And I was like, &#8220;No, it&#8217;s actually good that we can see this, but also this is the long tail problem. Anyone can launch a token and it&#8217;s only 1% of the total volume on all dexes that are associated with these tokens.&#8221; And so I worked hard to advocate that this is actually really good news, and good news because we can do it, but also because such a small share of all the trading volume is associated with these newly launched tokens that have suspicious trading patterns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, it&#8217;s really interesting. For anyone that&#8217;s ever done it, creating a token on the Ethereum blockchain is incredibly easy. The protocol spec is very straightforward. The three of us could get together, and in an hour or two, have shared a batch of tokens probably from a standing start. And I think there&#8217;s a lot of people out there who are probably experimenting with the technology, or they&#8217;re really just playing around with no ill intent. They&#8217;re having a laugh, trying to make a meme coin. Maybe it gets really popular like Pepe Token or something like that, I would imagine. But then it does seem like you found some evidence where individuals were intentionally creating a token, drawing enough attention and activity to it, that a few dollars came in, and then they run off with the money by swapping out into another asset. But I guess, like you said, good news that it&#8217;s not a massive dollar volume, right? It&#8217;s possible, but it doesn&#8217;t seem to be really gaining meaningful traction. Would that be the right summary on the research?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah. Yeah, I think so. And you&#8217;re right, anyone can launch a token. This is just a set of criteria that we&#8217;ve associated with pump and dumps in the past. But also this is just one way of running market manipulation. We&#8217;ve looked at wash trading of NFTs in the past, which would be a different, still straightforward, transposed query. But yeah, it&#8217;s a small percentage of the volume, and I think that it&#8217;s exciting to see that of all of the tokens launched, it&#8217;s only 1% of the volume that have some dubious activity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For anyone that wants to dive really deeper into this, we&#8217;ll post the link to the blog that Kim&#8217;s referencing in the show notes. And you can actually go and set up a free account on Transpose.io and run some of these queries yourself. We&#8217;re running out of time here, but Eric, I wanted to hit one last question, which was related to scam revenue. Now, we&#8217;ve spent a lot of time on this podcast talking about pig butchering, which is one flavor of scam that we track. And by my anecdotal experience, it doesn&#8217;t feel like that&#8217;s slowing down. If anything, it&#8217;s becoming industrialized. But looking at the data in 2023, we actually saw a fairly significant decline in dollars being siphoned off to scams, which I know struck, at least a few people who&#8217;ve reached out to me, as a little unusual. What do you think is behind that? What&#8217;s actually going on here? Are we maybe in a media moment where everyone&#8217;s now talking about a thing, but it&#8217;s not quite happening as much as it would suggest, just glancing at my Twitter timeline?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eric:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So I think important caveats to this question and to my answer would be that we report the data that we see at a given moment. And historically what we have is every year when we release our intro results to the world and say, &#8220;Here is the broad picture.&#8221; If you look back to what happened in terms of our estimated values the year prior, they tend to revise upwards. And so we were always at that point where our data&#8217;s constantly evolving and improving over time. And so I would caveat everything by saying those scam figures that we have released for the course of 2023, they will go up. Now, will they go up enough to correct the downward trend is another question, because over the last few years, we have seen, year-over-year, declines in scam related inflows. And that basically means we&#8217;re coming out of the bull market into the bear market and now into whatever we want to call where we&#8217;re at right now, what we&#8217;ve seen is a drawdown. Now there&#8217;s currency and denomination effects at play.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So when tokens are worth more and there&#8217;s more participants in the ecosystem who are flooding in to get yield or returns, you&#8217;d expect scamming revenue to go higher. We&#8217;ve documented fairly well that scam inflows tend to correlate pretty heavily with market activity. But I don&#8217;t know, I think that there&#8217;s something here that&#8217;s, I think, broader than that, which is this drawdown has been multi-year now. It isn&#8217;t responding in the way to over a hundred percent price appreciation of Bitcoin, for example. It&#8217;s not responding to that in the way that we&#8217;ve seen it historically. And so I think there&#8217;s a few things that might be going. There may be a media moment, as you said. Maybe part of it is people think scamming is more prevalent than it is.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Maybe what&#8217;s happening is alternative ways of measuring scamming activities is going up. So maybe the stigma about being scammed is washing away, so people are reporting more. And as a result of that, we&#8217;re seeing more reports which filter through into various outputs, but the on-chain footprint of what&#8217;s happening is actually going down. So more reporting, less scamming, to phrase it differently. It might also be that the nature of the scamming activities evolving in a way that makes it harder to track on-chain. Or it may even be the case that some of the crypto related scams might have no crypto dimension, per se. They may be&#8230; I mean, I could scam my parents. I&#8217;m not going to. Love them very much. I could scam my parents and say-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please don&#8217;t do that. Your parents are lovely. You don&#8217;t want to scam them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eric:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They are lovely. I could scam my parents and say, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to be doing crypto investments for you. Give me a thousand dollars through an e-transfer.&#8221; And it&#8217;ll never hit the blockchain. But they think that they&#8217;ve been scammed with crypto. And so they report a crypto scam, but it doesn&#8217;t have this blockchain related footprint. And so there&#8217;s all these different facets that I think are important for us as a wider ecosystem to bear in mind and try to reconcile going forward. Because in the face of it, yeah, it seems like multiple year over year drawdown is inconsistent with what some of the other things that we&#8217;re hearing, but it is possible if you start to add in, maybe it&#8217;s greater reporting, maybe it&#8217;s crypto scams without a blockchain dimension, etc, etc.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of a sudden the numbers can start to converge. So I think from my standpoint, the key thing is just information sharing and improving attribution is what we want to try to do, so that we can make clearer and better estimates going forward about the level of scam volume, and then we leverage our data in order to help scam victims get their funds back if they can, I think is also a crucial dimension. But it&#8217;s a tricky one because there isn&#8217;t a definitive answer as to why those two things seem to be moving in opposite directions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, for all the listeners out there, stay safe. If something sounds too good to be true, it is. Don&#8217;t send them your money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eric:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eric, Kim, this has been fantastic. Any final words before we wrap up?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">See you next year?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Absolutely. Hopefully sooner than that. These are some of my favorite podcast interviews. Thanks so much for joining us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kim:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eric:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks everyone.</span></p>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章提出了关于DeFi监管的必要性以及可行的措施，包括建立AML/CFT标准和加强网络安全措施。作者强调了政府与行业之间的合作，以共同确定DeFi项目应该避免的风险，并建立最低标准和良好实践。调查显示DeFi网络的资金流入情况，并指出中心化交易所对DeFi的影响。文章强调了监管与行业合作的重要性，并鼓励建立安全性相关的市场导向举措和规范。 <div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">How Decentralized Finance (DeFi) should be regulated is part of a broader debate about how we control technologies that operate without human intervention. There are similar deliberations around artificial intelligence (AI), as both represent paradigm shifts that will set lasting precedents for the future. The implications of how we regulate DeFi are incredibly nuanced and must be grappled with by industry, government, academia and civil society, and I am heartened to see that serious thinkers are beginning to put forward </span><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4607332"><span style="font-weight: 400;">conceptual frameworks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But today, we don’t need to make perfect the enemy of good. There are steps we can take to make DeFi safer </span><b>right now</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, specifically with basic AML/CFT standards and cybersecurity safeguards. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, government and industry must identify a shared baseline technical understanding of DeFi models, and their differences from centralized services. Second, government and industry should work together to identify &#8220;red line&#8221; risks that all DeFi projects should seek to mitigate. Private sector participation is key; builders and practitioners in the ecosystem are uniquely aware of their risks and are generally incentivised to address them. Collaboration on industry-wide minimum standards would provide a practical pathway toward oversight and compliance, and promote the development of high-quality DeFi applications and services that minimize harm and drive positive consumer outcomes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next step is to identify minimum standards and good practices. </span></p>
<h2><b>AML/CFT standards</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Anti-money laundering and counter terrorism financing standards are broadly accepted as the minimum requirements by which existing and emerging forms of value transfer must be upheld. Technology is available now to apply sanctions screening or address screening to DeFi. DeFi services could also consider different models to mitigate AML/CFT risks such as white/black listing to manage access or </span><a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4563364"><span style="font-weight: 400;">privacy pools</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Many of these solutions are easy to implement and are practical in the short term to de-risk these protocols. </span></p>
<h2><b>Cybersecurity safeguards</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Together, regulators and industry can establish clear expectations for smart cyber-hygiene in the DeFi space. Already, industry has created solutions that help foster higher levels of security in the sector, including the development of tools providing visibility into smart contracts and their on-chain governance arrangements.  In our </span><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/crypto-hacking-stolen-funds-2024/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2024 Crypto Crime Report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, we discuss how the decline in the hacking of DeFi protocols contributed to the overall 54% drop in stolen funds last year, but that still stands at a staggering $1.1 billion dollars, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many in the industry have recognised the need for collaborative security standards that can be used by teams to assess their cybersecurity measures and identify potential vulnerabilities. These include smart contract audits, which are essential to reducing the prolific hacking of DeFi protocols. And, these audits can be augmented by enlisting bug bounty programs or retaining incident response firms. Further, the </span><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rekt-test-security-standard-initiated-033104899.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAACEQsEsVrwt4B5oC62M8QU8h_ybZNoy8GQdTZT8gWpTUX8a5COKCVCzX44b3lVDkqOIiDyTXarGl3HtW0dxV9boQGptYIYGtBTgbAhfsHZZBgYrltO-B-ASuXTbSAezJwoqbTBv1lVUOSYhXsLrcThVQZG71-z7rO_6pj9HdStbl"><span style="font-weight: 400;">REKT test</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is a good example of cross-industry minimum standards for participants that has been championed over the last year.</span></p>
<h2><b>Looking ahead</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While immediate steps in AML/CFT and cybersecurity should be taken, regulators and industry will want to understand broader trends in the ecosystem to inform more robust regulatory frameworks. Thanks to blockchain technology’s inherent transparency, on-chain data can provide insights into which assets and DeFi platforms are the most popular, the activity of different categories of users (e.g. large holders of assets or small, retail participants), the interconnectedness and risk concentration within DeFi and across digital assets, and more. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, let&#8217;s look at DEXs and DeFi net inflow activity over the past year (January 1st, 2023 &#8211; December 31st 2023) compared with CExs and other services. We observe just how consistently the DEX and DeFi category received the most value, with February and March representing a distinct peak of inflows for the sector.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-12820" height="272" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/screenshot-2024-02-28-at-161001-800x272.png" width="800" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This amounts to around $26.33 billion of net inflows versus $15.28 billion for the next nearest category, minting and burning. Much of the DeFi inflows are received from centralized exchanges, demonstrating that it’s common for people to use centralized exchanges as an onramp to fund their DeFi activity. Ethereum is the gateway asset of choice to the DeFi sector, making up approximately 81% of net inflows over the period. More granular analysis could show the top counterparties that dominate these inflows down to the specific transaction level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The regulation of DeFi remains a complex and evolving challenge, with ongoing debates between regulators and industry players. Recognising the philosophical differences, we advocate for the focus to move toward practical, collaborative steps to achieve shared goals. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless of what happens next in the regulation of DeFi, when it comes to decentralised systems, relying on regulation alone will not be sufficient. To be effective, there must also be market-led initiatives and the establishment of norms that move the needle on making the market safer for consumers. </span></p>

<h2><b>Transcripts</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey, everyone. Welcome back to another episode of Public Key. This is your host, Ian Andrews. Today I&#8217;m joined by Joanna Summers, who is the chief recovery officer at Asset Reality. Joanna, welcome to the show.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joanna:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Good morning. Thank you for having me, Ian.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have to ask, what is a chief recovery officer, and how does one become that title?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joanna:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I run client relations here at Asset Reality. I help countries with their professional services, like managing and disposing of all different asset types. I help them build their asset forfeiture programs by developing their standard operating procedures, and also implementing our platform use. That&#8217;s a little bit of what I do externally as a chief recovery officer. Internally, I&#8217;m helping our team by providing some feedback on our platform development and meeting with various crypto exchanges, discussing partnerships and integration opportunities. A little bit of a unique title, but maybe it&#8217;ll become more common as the FATF recommendations are starting to be followed more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It sounds like a really exciting job, we&#8217;re going to unpack all of the things that you talked about there as we get into it. But I noticed on LinkedIn, before joining Asset Reality, you spent a long time at the Justice Department. Tell us about what you were doing there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joanna:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure. I was at the U.S. Marshals Service, asset forfeiture division, and I started in the complex assets unit in about mid-2013. And my role was working on any type of ongoing business or complex financial instrument that was subject to federal forfeiture. It could be all across the board from gas stations to franchised restaurants, hotels and motels, ranging from ones that need to be torn down and just resold as real property, all the way up to L&#8217;Hermitage, Beverly Hills Hotel, and the one MDB case. In terms of legacy work, we were valuing or ascertaining if there was any value to some of the Madoff LLCs. That was really the background when I first started. But before the end of the year, we had our first Bitcoin, and the cryptocurrency program took off from there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That sounds amazing. But before jumping into digital assets, I want to talk a little bit there, because I fortunately have never had the marshals tell me I needed to forfeit any of my assets. What&#8217;s the scenario where that would happen? I&#8217;ve been convicted of a crime and then everything that I own gets sold off? What&#8217;s a scenario where you would be brought in?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joanna:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure. One of the seizing agencies, like an FBI or a DEA, let&#8217;s say DEA would have a drug case. And in that case they have found the proceeds of crime include a Ferrari, a Rolex, some mansions, and some business interests that the defendant, thinking like Breaking Bad, had moved their money into the carwash, let&#8217;s say. Which is actually the impetus for a lot of the franchise restaurants that we had seen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wow. So FBI determines, or they suspect me of committing a crime. I am arrested, charged, I go to court. At that point are you getting involved, or is it after conviction where a seizure and recovery would kick off?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joanna:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ideally, you want to be involved as early as possible. We talk a lot about pre-seizure planning. Pre-seizure planning is so important, especially on the complex assets side of the house. If you&#8217;re talking about taking over a business, you need to be prepared to have that business managed so that day-to-Day operations can continue. The Marshal Service would come in that custody and management phase. But ideally, you&#8217;re involved with the US attorney&#8217;s office on the front end and the seizing agency on the front end to have a game plan before the seizure happens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wow. In the case of a restaurant franchise where you&#8217;ve got a number of locations, are you going in and running payroll and hiring and firing employees who are working the cook line or serving food in the restaurant?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joanna:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, ideally, absolutely not, because that type of workload is just not sustainable. For a federal agency, it&#8217;s a one case of many. The idea is that you&#8217;ve got a management company in place that&#8217;s handling those day-to-day operations for you. Especially in a lot of the hotels, I would get say a weekly report on the financials, anything that&#8217;s significant that had occurred on the property, and then you&#8217;re looking at a monthly call with management to review how the month went and see what&#8217;s on deck for the next month. It&#8217;s more of that management capacity of you want to be overseeing the contractor. You need an idea of what you&#8217;re looking at, maybe to be able to read some financial statements or have a general idea of the industry. But ideally you&#8217;re not involved in any of that day-to-day work, because you probably have hundreds of cases on your desk to get through.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, I would imagine that would be tricky. And is the ultimate goal to actually then sell the asset off, or is the government actually operating all of the franchise restaurants in my neighborhood and I don&#8217;t know it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joanna:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, the goal is absolutely to sell the assets as soon as you&#8217;ve got that court order authorizing you to do so. It&#8217;s actually one of the most tracked metrics is, it forfeited and has it been disposed of yet? Is that aged inventory, it&#8217;s called. You really want to make sure you&#8217;re following that process as quickly and efficiently as possible. So no, you&#8217;re not sitting on assets or playing the market just because, hey, there&#8217;s a stock in this brokerage account I really like. And I think it&#8217;s going to go up in value, so I&#8217;m going to hold onto it for three more months. That&#8217;s not the idea. The idea is to follow the process. And to your point, you really want to get to that recovery stage so that you&#8217;re putting those funds back into an asset forfeiture fund or you&#8217;re giving them back to victims. A lot of the time we hear the headline, the flashy headline of the really cool seizure that just happened, but it&#8217;s the follow-up where it really counts to make asset forfeiture programs work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, I was going to say, I think a lot of people assume the government seizes a car or a restaurant, or maybe a hotel in the example you gave earlier, and then after they&#8217;ve sold it on that money stays with the government. But that&#8217;s not usually the case, right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joanna:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, a variety of things can happen when the funds go into an asset forfeiture fund. They could go back to public service, such as building highways, building roads, building hospitals or schools. They could be put into building a new rehab facility. There&#8217;s a variety of uses that they&#8217;re used for. Law enforcement training would be another big one. And then in the case of victims, you do have the availability for victim restitution, so paying back victims proceeds of crime.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, amazing. You said earlier that about a year into your job was the first time you ever encountered cryptocurrency. Had you heard about crypto or had any familiarity with it before it came up in the work context?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joanna:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had vaguely heard of it in 2013. We all kind of knew what it was in our unit, but we hadn&#8217;t had a chance to really dive into it and look into it further until we got that call and it was like, &#8220;Hey, you&#8217;re getting cryptocurrency and you&#8217;re going to have to sell it pretty soon.&#8221; That&#8217;s when the deep dive into researching the best custody management and disposal methods started.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can you share what case that was back in 2013?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joanna:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah. We started off with a pretty big one, it was the Silk Road case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okay, that was going to be my guess.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joanna:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah. And the order was entered in January of 2014 to sell the assets. There were four separate sealed bid auctions that we held across 2014 and 2015 to sell about 175,000 Bitcoin that were seized from the Silk Road servers and the defendant. And we kept that auction model going in a variety of cases through March of 2018, maybe 2020, as we developed the program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By the time you left Marshals, it sounds like pretty robust program in terms of how to handle virtual assets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joanna:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, absolutely. By then we had started to see a variety of currencies, it wasn&#8217;t just Bitcoin anymore. And that&#8217;s something that we&#8217;ve heard around the world is we&#8217;ve got all these different currencies, and how do we manage all of them? We thought we figured it out because we figured out Bitcoin, but now we&#8217;re having more and more currencies to manage and not every exchange allows us to liquidate them. So what do we do from here? Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You said you had to figure out custody pretty quickly when this first case came up. What was the solution back then, and did that change over time?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joanna:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The solution back then was cold storage. The Mt. Gox exchange had just collapsed, so there was a lot of fear over using any type of centralized exchange to store the currency. And I would say that&#8217;s changed over time in the sense that there&#8217;s just more options now. And that&#8217;s one of the things that we have built into our platform, is that flexibility to use a variety of cold storage methods, a variety of exchanges, and a variety of platforms to really be able to handle anything that comes our way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So even the Marshal service believes in not your keys, not your coins. Is that what I&#8217;m hearing?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joanna:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Absolutely. Absolutely. It&#8217;s a message we try to preach around the world. Yep.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, it sounds like it was an amazing job. What led you to joining the Asset Reality team?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joanna:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was fortunate enough in my government career to not only work with US agencies, but to speak to a lot of agencies internationally. Especially once crypto became more prominent, it was a lot of the same questions internationally. And I saw the need for a comprehensive seized asset management platform that included monitoring cryptocurrency. And I really wanted to help build that platform, and I really wanted to help countries around the world improve their asset forfeiture programs. So speaking with Aidan and with Asset Reality, it was very similar to a private sector Marshal Service looking to simplify the process of asset recovery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you say working with countries around the world, where are you spending most of your time today? Where is the biggest concentration of interest on digital asset recovery?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joanna:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, offshore jurisdictions, the Caribbean, Africa, the EU as well. It&#8217;s a little bit all over the place, which is exciting and fun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah. So you&#8217;re spending a lot of time on a plane, I would imagine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joanna:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes. A lot of travel, which I also love.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, I&#8217;m curious, you mentioned back in 2013 obviously Bitcoin was the big thing, and then you saw a widening of the aperture as other cryptocurrencies came into play. I would imagine things like Eth became much more significant. I&#8217;m curious today how much you&#8217;re seeing things like NFTs, which probably present their own challenges in terms of recovery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joanna:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, absolutely. It&#8217;s something that we see mostly with the EU or the US. It&#8217;s not something that we see seized as frequently in some of those other jurisdictions that are maybe working their first crypto case or just starting to get involved in crypto. It&#8217;s still a little beyond what those jurisdictions are identifying for seizure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;m curious, you&#8217;ve mentioned a couple of times the platform that the team is building. What actually is that? And maybe if you can answer in the shape of how you would work with a government that calls you up and says, &#8220;Hey, Joanna, we need some help. We&#8217;ve got some really complex things that we want to seize here.&#8221; What happens from that point forward?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joanna:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We handle the entire seized asset process from end to end. From a crypto perspective, we&#8217;re integrated with Fireblocks and several other custodian options like a Fidelity Digital Assets, a Coinbase, and we work with a variety of different exchanges. We&#8217;re agnostic on that front. We will be flexible and work with whatever the country deems as an acceptable platform to use or to not use. And I think one of the key differences is that we don&#8217;t offer retail, so everything we do has a court order nexus to it. Whether that&#8217;s an insolvency practitioner, a bankruptcy proceeding, or it&#8217;s a government agency that&#8217;s looking for crypto and physical asset storage, everything has to have a court order nexus to it. And as far as I know, that&#8217;s not available anywhere in the world.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why the court order nexus? It seems like there&#8217;s lots of people out there who have had fallen victim to a scam or something else. I would imagine they call you all the time. I know we get lots of calls here at Chainalysis from individuals who say, &#8220;Help, I&#8217;ve lost my crypto.&#8221; But it sounds like you&#8217;re not focused on serving that audience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joanna:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, absolutely. We&#8217;ve never really serviced the retail customers for crypto, but we did a lot of victim support when I first started at Asset Reality, and we shifted away from that to keep our focus on the professional services and on building our platform. And we realized if we can focus on supporting jurisdictions with infrastructure, that long-term that will empower them to be able to work those types of cases more efficiently. If the government has the capacity to do the work from investigations to management and liquidation, then they&#8217;re in a position to help with victim support. And that&#8217;s especially true of these overseas jurisdictions, many of whom lack that infrastructure. Even if you were to send something over to them from a victim that lost something, you&#8217;re not going to get any information back if they don&#8217;t have the infrastructure upfront to help you. But yes, when I first started, I did speak to a lot of victims, it was interesting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah. I can imagine going upstream in serving that infrastructure is actually really important. It enables law enforcement and the rest of government to do their job much more effectively if they&#8217;ve got the right tools. I&#8217;m curious, what&#8217;s the perspective of the financial action task force when it comes to asset recovery? I know my experience, FADF has done lots of work around anti-money laundering and counter terrorist financing. Have they started to look at this space and give guidance to countries on how they should develop their programs?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joanna:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the stats that we see quoted a lot from FADF is a UNODC statistic stating that countries intercept and recover less than 1% of global illicit financial flows. And that&#8217;s a pretty scary statistic when you think about it. Especially because that statistic came out almost a decade ago at this point, so it&#8217;s almost pre-crypto forfeitures and the world really getting involved in crypto asset forfeiture. I&#8217;d imagine at this point that 1% could even be a lot lower now. And countries do need to do a better job with it, and that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re planning to help them do. FADF highlights seizing expeditiously, which is what our app can do by helping generate a crypto wallet address. And I think it&#8217;s a great focus that FADF has, because it&#8217;s really needed worldwide when you look at the lack of infrastructure and those scary statistics like a 1% recovery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think FADF is going to be focusing on it a lot more in the next few years to come. They&#8217;ve already said, according to REC 15, that countries and financial institutions should identify and assess for money laundering and financing risks, and that they&#8217;re going to be focused on it by making sure these countries are developing new products to help combat those risks. This has led to the EU directive to have an asset management platform, and it&#8217;s also led to FADF stating they&#8217;re going to produce another targeted update report focusing on the jurisdiction&#8217;s progress, so who&#8217;s complying, who&#8217;s not complying. And I think that follow-up comes from the fact that three-quarters of jurisdictions were viewed as only partially or not compliant with those FADF requirements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wow. That 1% statistic blows me away, because I think the estimate is something like $2 trillion in illicit finance. So 1% of a very, very big number. And your guess is it&#8217;s actually gotten worse, not better, since that statistic was formulated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joanna:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, I&#8217;d love to see an updated statistic on that because I do think it&#8217;s gotten a bit worse. And I hate to see that, because I think that&#8217;s so much money that&#8217;s being left in the hands of criminals that should be given back to the government and to victims of crime.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The saying goes, crime doesn&#8217;t pay, but it sounds like in this case maybe it does for some people. Unless we can solve this problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joanna:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes. And I think we will. No one wants to get grey listed. We have seen countries go on the FADF grey list, and come off the grey list, but that leads to just a whole set of consequences economically. If a country is grey listed, it&#8217;s a decrease in international financial assistance, international financial aid due to de-risking. I understand that countries want to focus on making sure that they&#8217;re not part of that grey list. Or if they are already, improving so they can come off it because that can be a huge hit to the economy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah. We&#8217;ve had some law enforcement professionals on the podcast in the past, and they&#8217;ve told some pretty fantastic stories about arresting a suspect and seizing a thumb drive or maybe another hardware wallet implementation and treating it traditional evidence, like putting it in a bag and throwing it in an evidence locker. And then finding out much later that what they thought at the time contained a large amount of digital assets, it was gone by the time somebody came back around to it. And that story has always stuck with me because I imagine that is a fairly common practice, and I feel like you might know this and can guide on why that&#8217;s a bad idea. What would be the right approach in that scenario?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joanna:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah. Unfortunately, that&#8217;s something that we have definitely heard, especially as we work in countries that are just getting started with cryptocurrency. We hear either a lot of&#8230; I&#8217;ll do a training and I&#8217;ll show a picture of a hardware device, and I&#8217;ll be like, &#8220;Has anyone seen this before?&#8221; Because some jurisdictions go, &#8220;Oh, we don&#8217;t have crypto in our country.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Okay, have you seen these before?&#8221; And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, yeah, I&#8217;ve seen those on a lot of different takedowns that I&#8217;ve been on, and cars we&#8217;ve pulled over.&#8221; And it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Okay, well that was crypto, so who knows what was on it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But I&#8217;ve definitely had that exact scenario happen where people didn&#8217;t understand you need to transfer the currency immediately. Not your keys, not your coins. If you&#8217;re not controlling those private keys and you&#8217;re not transferring the crypto to an agency controlled or a contract or agency controlled wallet right away, whatever you put in evidence and decided to check a year later is probably not going to be there. And we&#8217;ve heard that too where people have said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what this guy was doing, but we went to go arrest him, and he just wouldn&#8217;t stop sending this text message. We had to rip the phone out of his hands.&#8221; And it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Yeah, he was giving the signal to everyone to go move all the assets immediately.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What&#8217;s the right approach? With your platform, it sounds like you make it very easy to set up a new digital wallet that&#8217;s controlled by the government. How do you get a suspect to give up access, that seed phrase to the hardware device? How does that process actually play out?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joanna:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A few different things happen. Sometimes the seed phrase is sitting out and it&#8217;s easy to find. Sometimes the suspects are just willing to give it up. In cases where they&#8217;re willing to give it up, it&#8217;s usually because they&#8217;re going to be facing a very stiff money judgment and they just realize that the gig is up. They either don&#8217;t want to do as much time in jail, they want their money judgment paid, and they&#8217;re just going to go ahead and comply at that point.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah. Often you can form some sort of cooperative encouragement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joanna:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes. Yeah, sometimes. Yes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then, how does the digital assets typically get disposed of? You mentioned the platform plugs into a bunch of different trading venues. Is it like the auction process you described it at Marshals, or is it a case where you just go and sell on the open market on a platform like Coinbase?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joanna:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The great thing about having a platform to manage the disposal process is having that variety of options and being able to get really competitive pricing. We can ask around to a variety of different exchanges and see what&#8217;s going to work best. And sometimes it&#8217;s a case of not only are we liquidating an asset, but then we need to convert the fiat into a different currency, to either British pounds, or to the dollar, to the Euro. So you&#8217;re doing multiple steps in that liquidation. I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s similar to the auction process in the sense that you expect there to be KYC and AML compliance, and bidders need to be vetted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the things we focus on with countries when we help them develop their standard operating procedures is having those processes in place. If you&#8217;re going to hold an auction or you&#8217;re going to liquidate cryptocurrency, how are you making sure that none of those bidders were the brother or the sister of the defendant? You don&#8217;t want something being resold back to the defendant and his family. In some situations, you can only do your best, it&#8217;s out of your control what happens once that next person buys it. But doing that type of a compliance check and just really asking around for the best price is important.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah. I remember there used to be a time where, in the US at least, people would advertise these seized car auctions where you could go get a great deal on some luxury automobile that had been presumably seized from some criminal somewhere. But I would imagine with digital assets, Bitcoin is Bitcoin, no one really cares about the provenance. So you&#8217;re looking to maximize the value of that, right? You want to sell in such a way that you&#8217;re getting market price in every case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joanna:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, you want to be getting market price and you also want to make sure you&#8217;re not affecting the market. This was true working on the liquidation of brokerage accounts and stock portfolios, and also for crypto as well. If you start affecting the market, then there&#8217;s innocent people who had nothing to do with this crime that they&#8217;re seeing everything take a hit in price. You want to be careful not to have that happen. And a lot of the exchanges now have really sophisticated trading algorithms that make sure that doesn&#8217;t happen. And you&#8217;re also in control to stop or slow down the sale process if you do see the market slipping. That&#8217;s definitely an important consideration when liquidating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah. Now, one of our most popular topics on this podcast over the last two years has been pig butchering, this romance flavored scam that victims are often contacted out of the blue and then they&#8217;re established some sort of ongoing relationship with the scammer. I know that you mentioned you had the opportunity to spend a lot of time with victims early in your career at Asset Reality. How do you see that type of scam resolving? Is it something where we can just raise the sophistication level of government, or do we also need to establish some sort of protective solution for victims as well? What are your thoughts there?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joanna:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s such a hard situation because there&#8217;s so many of these scams. And when you look at IC3, which is the internet crime complaint center run by the FBI, you can see that cryptocurrency investment fraud has increased 183% in 2022. We&#8217;re looking at $2.57 billion lost to investment scams. And that&#8217;s just the number that has a USA nexus to it and just what was reported. And we know a lot of victims don&#8217;t report because they&#8217;re too embarrassed too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the things I saw a lot of in these cases was the revictimization of victims. And the first question I was always asked was, how do I get my money back? And they&#8217;re asking that to a good trusting party. They&#8217;re also asking that first question to any type of scammer who&#8217;s just exploiting fact that they&#8217;re vulnerable and ready to pay some amount of money again to just have the problem solved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think part of the problem is education, just making sure people understand that there&#8217;s a lot of red flags to look for if you&#8217;re going to be speaking to a firm that claims they&#8217;re going to help you with crypto asset recovery. It&#8217;s education on all sides. In terms of victim education, you shouldn&#8217;t be working with someone who&#8217;s requesting a non-refundable payment up first. You shouldn&#8217;t be working with someone who&#8217;s guaranteeing you a return. It&#8217;s very difficult to get a return. And recovery litigation is very expensive. You also want to make sure someone&#8217;s working with law enforcement. You cannot do this without law enforcement assistance, you still need a law enforcement agency to help you seize.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And I&#8217;d say last and probably most importantly is working with blockchain analytic companies. Making sure that asset recovery firm you&#8217;re talking to, that they&#8217;re working with a Chainalysis in order to trace those token types and use some of the best technology available. And then on the government side it&#8217;s also education. It&#8217;s making sure no one says, &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t do crypto investigations,&#8221; or &#8220;That stuff goes in the too hard pile. We don&#8217;t take custody of that stuff.&#8221; It&#8217;s making sure that everyone&#8217;s willing to pitch in and work those types of cases from the investigators to the prosecutors, everyone, every step of the way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah. If you&#8217;ve been unlucky enough to be a victim, it sounds like step one is get law enforcement involved as soon as you can. And then step two, be very wary of anyone promising that they can get all your money back and that they can solve the problem with just yet another payment, because there&#8217;s a good chance that they&#8217;re actually running a scam as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joanna:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Absolutely. If you&#8217;re a US citizen, you should make sure you&#8217;re reporting through IC3. And that&#8217;s not to say that there aren&#8217;t good crypto asset recovery firms out there and good public sector divisions working on this, you just need to be leery and be aware of the fact that it&#8217;s probably going to be very expensive. If you look at some of the work Erin West and Operation Shamrock are doing, it&#8217;s really impressive on the pig butchering schemes and raising awareness to what they are, and how to proceed if you&#8217;ve been a victim of one. Cybera, also in the private sector, they&#8217;ve been a great company that helps victims with these types of cases.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two former guests on the podcast, Erin West and Nicola from Cybera.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joanna:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fantastic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perfect shout-outs, I love it. Any other former friends of the podcast you&#8217;d like to plug while you&#8217;re at it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joanna:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No, I&#8217;ll leave it there for now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Okay. Different topic for you. I saw on your bio that you are an ambassador for the Association for Women in Crypto. They&#8217;re doing some terrific work in the ecosystem. Maybe share with the audience a little bit about what the association does and what your role as an ambassador is all about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joanna:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I am the DC regional ambassador for Women in Crypto. And I&#8217;ve known Amanda for a long time from my DOJ days when she was in AUSA and I was working at the Marshal Service. I was really, really excited when she launched this initiative. I believe it actually started with her days at Chainalysis, and starting to interview women leaders in the industry. And then it snowballed into the Women in Cryptocurrency Association. The idea is that it helps bring different voices and diverse ways of thinking that can help build better solution. We want to ensure that the future of digital finance and innovation is built with equality for women. And I do see sometimes people ask, is there going to be pushback on some of the events if you&#8217;re pushing for women to be a part of it? And I think when you come to these events, it&#8217;s really a benefit of the doubt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of the organizers of conferences, they don&#8217;t always know how to find qualified women speakers. Sometimes they&#8217;re hosting a conference, but they&#8217;re not necessarily in the crypto space, they&#8217;re planning an event. Whereas, you or I might know a lot of great speakers off the top of our head, I think sometimes it&#8217;s just knowing where to look. One of the initiatives that we&#8217;re doing in Women in Crypto is we are launching a global speaker directory of qualified women who are willing to speak on panels or willing to speak solo at conferences.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Awesome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joanna:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, I think so too. And I think it&#8217;s especially fun for me to work with just women right out of college who need mentorship, who are maybe a little intimidated by speaking on a panel or by doing a podcast, or they just need some help and some reassurance that they know how to do it and do a dry run with someone. We love to offer any type of mentorship opportunity as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I really, really enjoy my work on that, and I expect us to be rolling out a lot more events this year and next year as well. I was amazed at how many people joined the association over the last year. Not at all surprised, just really excited about it. And now I think we&#8217;re into that next phase of really making sure that we&#8217;re holding events and a variety of great events, whether that&#8217;s a happy hour in the evening, a crypto and coffee session in the morning, or tacking on a network event pre or post-conference, just to make sure everyone can get to know each other a little bit better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It sounds like an amazing organization. Love the mission and the focus on bringing more women into the industry. If listeners want to find out more, where should they go? How do we follow along?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joanna:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would follow along by going to the Women in Crypto LinkedIn page, and you can also go to womenincrypto.org, that&#8217;s the website. Highly recommend you join. We also have events that you don&#8217;t need to be a member to be a part of. So if you just want to come check it out, see what we&#8217;re all about, we&#8217;re happy to host as well if it&#8217;s something you want to just think about before you go right in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazing. We will link to both of those in the show notes so people can follow along.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joanna:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last question for you, what should we expect coming up in 2024 for you and Asset Reality?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joanna:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, speaking of FADF from earlier, the FADF effect from 2019 and that push towards these better systems to regulate virtual assets, that led to such an explosion in your field and the blockchain analytic companies. And now I&#8217;m really excited to see that asset recovery is this next focus, and we&#8217;re super excited to be the world&#8217;s first company dedicated to this sector with software and services to make it easier to seize assets. I think the thing I&#8217;m most excited about is our platform launch in April, which is absolutely perfect timing to be at Chainalysis Links and have a booth there. I really hope everyone stops by our booth at Chain Links, because I&#8217;d love to show our demo of how we can seize assets in under 60 seconds and have them on the platform, and show how we run reports and just how the whole platform works.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can&#8217;t wait. I will be there. I maybe will be the first person at the booth to see that demo, but I&#8217;m sure many of our listeners will line up behind me. And look forward to seeing you in April.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Joanna:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fantastic. I can&#8217;t wait. Thanks, Ian.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks so much.</span></p>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。文章提到了浪漫诈骗和加密货币之间的联系，描述了如何骗子利用浪漫关系来诱骗受害者投资虚假投资机会。文章还提到了在中国和东南亚地区进行浪漫诈骗的人被绑架、贩卖和强迫工作的情况。描述了他们被迫工作的恶劣条件。文章还提到了恢复加密货币犯罪资金的努力。通过解冻与东南亚国际人口贩运集团相关的加密货币资金等行动取得了一些成果。对于加密货币企业，鼓励他们寻找与此类活动的任何潜在风险，并向执法部门提供尽可能多的信息。 <div>
<p>Romance scams, also known as “pig butchering scams” for the way bad actors say they “fatten up” their victims to extract the most possible value, are a large and growing problem with a significant crypto nexus. Romance scammers start by building a relationship over time with the victim (usually of a romantic nature, as the name implies), often <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/02/pig-butchering-scammers-make-billions-convincing-victims-of-love.html">initiating contact</a> by pretending to have text messaged a wrong number or via dating apps. As the relationship deepens, the scammer will eventually push the victim to invest money (sometimes cryptocurrency, sometimes fiat) in a fake investment opportunity, and continue to do so until they eventually sever contact.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-12765" height="512" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/pb-text-example.png" width="385" /></p>
<p><i>Source: </i><a href="https://www.coindesk.com/learn/crypto-romance-scams-dont-fall-for-these-dating-app-swindlers/"><i>CoinDesk</i></a></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/Media/PDF/AnnualReport/2022_IC3Report.pdf">FBI’s 2022 IC3 Report</a> states that in 2022, Americans reported losses of over $700 million to romance scams in both cryptocurrency and fiat, and nearly $2.5 billion to crypto investment scams of any kind, regardless of whether there was a romance element. Those numbers also don’t take into account victims in other countries, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/world/asia/china-rounds-up-31-000-suspects-in-sweeping-pig-butchering-crackdown-00af42f0">such as China</a>, whose residents are also heavily targeted in these schemes.</p>
<p>But, while many are aware of the havoc romance scamming wrecks on those who fall victim, there’s now also a growing awareness of the exploitation of the scammers themselves — the people on the other side of the unsolicited text messages. As we <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/chainalysis-podcast-episode-19-pig-butchering-scams/">discussed</a> on the Chainalysis Public Key podcast in 2022 with reporter Alastair McCready and as the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/12/17/world/asia/myanmar-cyber-scam.html"><i>New York Times</i> more recently reported</a>, individuals throughout China and Southeast Asia have been kidnapped, trafficked, and forced to work in labor camps housed within large compounds, carrying out pig butchering scams. Cities like Myawaddy in Myanmar are hot spots for this activity, as political instability there has allowed pig butchering gangs to operate with impunity.</p>
<h3>Inside the KK Park: Myanmar’s most notorious pig butchering compound</h3>
<p>We spoke with Eric Heintz, Global Analyst at the Global Fusion Center of the <a href="https://www.ijm.org/">International Justice Mission</a>. There, Heintz and his team assist IJM’s field offices in their work to help human trafficking victims of pig butchering gangs. As part of this effort, they also track the gangs themselves, monitoring their recruiting activity on social media, mapping out their compounds through satellite imagery, and communicating with victims.</p>
<p>“The conditions these people face are horrible,” he told us. “They’re forced to work 12 or more hours per day, and if they don’t meet quotas on contacting potential scam victims, the gangs beat them, torture them, and even withhold food.”</p>
<p>Heintz also told us a bit more about the compounds themselves. Typically, one company owns the land and the buildings, and then rents them out to other companies who carry out the actual romance scams. According to Heintz, the owners of the compounds often also provide “security” for their tenants, meaning guards who will prevent human trafficking victims from escaping.</p>
<p>How do the companies within these compounds use cryptocurrency? Of course, we know that they take crypto payments from scam victims. But Heintz also told us that pig butchering gangs will often tell the families of trafficked workers to pay them ransoms in exchange for their family member’s freedom — those payments also often happen in cryptocurrency. Heintz sent us ransom payment addresses provided to him by trafficking victims and their families, associated with a pig butchering gang at KK Park, one of the most notable compounds in Southeast Asia. “Some scam operations may be mixing proceeds from scams with ransom payments from victim families,” said Heintz. Indeed, the addresses he provided show on-chain connections to addresses associated with romance scams, in addition to activity likely related to ransom payments.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-12767" height="422" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/kkpark-17jan2024-min-800x422.jpg" width="800" /></p>
<p><i>Satellite image of KK Park ©2023 Maxar Technologies</i></p>
<p>First, some context on KK Park before we dive into on-chain analysis. KK Park is one of the biggest, most notorious romance scam compounds in operation today. Located in the aforementioned Myanmarese town of Myawaddy, <a href="https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3228543/inside-chinese-run-crime-hubs-myanmar-are-conning-world-we-can-kill-you-here">KK Park is reported</a> to hold over 2,000 trafficked romance scam workers. The two ransom addresses provided to us by Heintz are, according to him, associated with a Chinese front company for a pig butchering gang that operates out of KK Park. The <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/chainalysis-reactor/">Chainalysis Reactor</a> graph below shows some of the addresses’ on-chain activity.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-12769" height="391" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/kk-park-final-final-800x391.png" width="800" /></p>
<p>From just the two ransom addresses provided to us by Heintz, we’re able to gain insight into millions of dollars’ worth of activity associated with this prolific pig butchering gang. First, we see that while the addresses were provided to victims’ families as a means of ransom payment, both have also received significant funds from a number of known scam addresses. Ransom address 1, for instance, has received roughly $24.2 million in crypto from the four scam-associated wallets to its left. Both ransom addresses send and receive significant amounts to and from mainstream exchanges — some of those incoming transactions are likely ransoms. In total, since becoming active in July 2022, the two addresses together have received just under $100 million in crypto inflows, though it&#8217;s unclear how much of that total comes from scamming versus ransom payments. Given that these are just two addresses from a single company operating out of KK Park, we can infer that on the whole, pig butchering scammers working out of the compound are making significant sums.</p>
<p>Our on-chain analysis shows how tightly interwoven pig butchering gangs’ ransom-taking operations are with their primary business of conducting romance scams. The brutal conditions trafficking victims face on the compounds also lend additional urgency to solving the problem of romance scamming — not only are consumers being bilked out of hundreds of millions of dollars each year, but the gangs behind those scams are also perpetuating a humanitarian crisis. The good news is the cryptocurrency ecosystem is taking action: In November, the stablecoin issuer Tether and the cryptocurrency exchange OKX <a href="https://www.okx.com/learn/tether-okx-investigation">announced</a> that they collaborated with the United States Department of Justice in an investigation that led to Tether freezing approximately $225 million in USDT tokens linked to an international human trafficking syndicate in Southeast Asia responsible for romance scams, helped in part by Chainalysis solutions. Additionally, a <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/interpol-operation-arrests-3-500-cybercriminals-seizes-300-million/">South Korea-led Interpol operation</a> in late 2023 saw authorities arrest 3,500 cybercriminals associated with online scamming and seize $300 million in funds, $100 million of which was made up of digital assets. <b> </b>We encourage all cryptocurrency businesses to search for any possible exposure they may have to this activity, and report as much information as they can to law enforcement.</p>

<title>U.S. and U.K. Disrupt Lockbit Ransomware Group and Indict Two Russian Nationals While OFAC Levies Sanctions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。2024年2月20日，NCA和FBI宣布成功破坏了Lockbit勒索软件组织，共同抓获了两名涉案俄罗斯公民。Lockbit是一个非常活跃的RaaS组织，攻击了2000多名受害者，获得了1.2亿美元的收入。此次行动获取了解密密钥，帮助受害者恢复数据。随后，美国司法部对涉案人员进行指控和制裁。Lockbit是RaaS市场中使用最广泛的勒索软件之一，但其运营不够专业，在利润和制裁风险上存在较大风险。 <div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On February 20, 2024, the <a href="https://www.nationalcrimeagency.gov.uk/news/nca-leads-international-investigation-targeting-worlds-most-harmful-ransomware-group">U.K.&#8217;s National Crime Agency (NCA)</a>, alongside the </span><a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/us-and-uk-disrupt-lockbit-ransomware-variant"><span style="font-weight: 400;">U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)</span></a>,<span style="font-weight: 400;"> announced the disruption of Lockbit, which has been one of the most prolific Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) groups operating over the last few years. In this operation, the NCA, FBI, and international law enforcement partners worked together to seize servers and public-facing websites that were integral to Lockbit’s operations, and have obtained decryptor keys for Lockbit victims to recover their data without paying a ransom. The DOJ also announced charges against Artur Sungatov and Ivan Kondratyev, two Russian nationals accused of acting as Lockbit RaaS affiliates and using the strain in ransomware attacks. Additionally, </span><a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2114"><span style="font-weight: 400;">OFAC sanctioned both individuals</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for their ransomware activities, and included ten total cryptocurrency addresses as SDN List identifiers. These actions come following the May 2023 indictment and sanctioning of Lockbit-affiliated ransomware developer </span><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/ransomware-ofac-mikhail-matveev-babuk/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mikhail Matveev</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We’re proud to share that the NCA used Chainalysis tools in carrying out this investigation. Below, we’ll talk more about the unique position Lockbit occupied within the ransomware ecosystem and why this action was important. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lockbit was one of the most widely used RaaS strains</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the DOJ, Lockbit attacked over 2,000 victims and made over $120 million in revenue. Our data shows that Lockbit’s prominence within the ransomware ecosystem was growing quickly over time.</span></p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">Year</span></td>

<td><span style="font-weight: 400;">2</span></td>

</tbody>
</table>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, Lockbit was among the most resilient strains in the ransomware ecosystem since the RaaS launched, and remained active for longer than most other strains.</span></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-12751" height="418" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/lockbit-lifecycle-800x418.png" width="800" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a </span><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/ransomware-raas-cryptocurrency-2019/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">RaaS</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> strain, Lockbit malware was available for other cybercriminals known as affiliates to rent in order to launch their own ransomware attacks in exchange for a cut of any revenue from those attacks. Our data suggests that Lockbit was one of the most prolific and widely used RaaS strains in operation, with potentially hundreds of affiliates, including many associated with other prominent strains. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lockbit’s willingness to provide services to so many affiliates may be one reason for the </span><a href="https://therecord.media/ransomware-saint-anthony-hospital-chicago"><span style="font-weight: 400;">chaos researchers have observed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> within the group, such as the group’s continuing attacks against hospitals even after core administrators vowed to stop targeting healthcare providers, and an incident in which Lockbit administrators publicly refused to pay an affiliate for an attack. These incidents and seeming inability to coordinate may be the result of a lack of affiliate vetting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At times, Lockbit’s administrators engaged in publicity stunts whose value appears questionable in comparison to their risk to the group’s operational security. For example, in 2022, a Lockbit administrator known by the online handle LockBitSupp announced that they would pay $1,000 to anyone who got a </span><a href="https://twitter.com/vxunderground/status/1568273779050127363?lang=en"><span style="font-weight: 400;">tattoo of the Lockbit logo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Analysis of LockBitSupp’s on-chain activity during this time period suggests that, shockingly, many took them up on the offer. We can see some of these payments on the <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/chainalysis-reactor/">Chainalysis Reactor</a> graph below.</span></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-12752" height="836" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/lockbit-tattoo-reactor-800x836.png" width="800" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suffice it to say, administrator behavior like this and the seemingly low bar for affiliate access to Lockbit doesn’t paint the group as the most professional in the ransomware ecosystem.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lockbit and sanctions risk</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even before recent sanctions explicitly targeting Lockbit affiliates, the strain’s low barrier to entry made the RaaS an attractive cover for threat actors to obfuscate their sanctions ties. For instance, in June 2022, cybersecurity firm Mandiant </span><a href="https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/unc2165-shifts-to-evade-sanctions"><span style="font-weight: 400;">released research</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> suggesting that Russian ransomware gang Evil Corp had begun using Lockbit. Mandiant positioned this as likely an effort by Evil Corp to disguise itself, as at that time Evil Corp’s own connection to sanctioned Russian entities was decreasing its victims’ willingness to pay ransoms — you can read our prior research on </span><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2022-crypto-crime-report-preview-ransomware/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">ransomware strain rebranding</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to learn more about this practice. On-chain data confirms the connection between Lockbit and Evil Corp, as we see on the Reactor Graph below.</span></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-12753" height="480" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/lockbit-evil-corp-2-800x480.png" width="800" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here, we see Lockbit and two other strains that have been identified as Evil Corp rebrands sending funds to the same exchange deposit address. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, we also see on-chain evidence of Lockbit affiliates working with an Iranian ransomware strain and depositing at an Iranian exchange suggesting the pictured Lockbit affiliate is likely Iranian.— Iran is, of course, one of the most heavily sanctioned jurisdictions in the world. </span></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-12754" height="270" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/lockbit-iran-2-800x270.png" width="800" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, blockchain analysis also shows that a Lockbit administrator also donated crypto to a pro-Russia self-proclaimed military journalist based in Sevastopol known as Colonel Cassad. Throughout social media, Colonel Cassad has solicited donations for Russian militia group operations in the sanctioned jurisdictions of Donetsk and Luhansk, as </span><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/pro-russian-crypto-donations-war-in-ukraine/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">we identified early on in the Russian war against Ukraine</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-12755" height="481" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/lockbit-cassad-2-800x481.png" width="800" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Talos cybersecurity </span><a href="https://blog.talosintelligence.com/ukraine-campaign-delivers-defacement/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">researchers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have previously written about links between Colonel Cassad and Russian state hacking unit Fancy Bear, which has been </span><a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/threat-eu-high-russia-hackers-launch-cyberattacks-fancy-bear-election/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sanctioned by the EU</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">OFAC notes ten cryptocurrency addresses in sanctions against Lockbit affiliates Artur Sungatov and Ivan Kondratyev</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In its SDN List entries for Lockbit affiliates Ivan Kondratyev and Artur Sungatov, OFAC included a total of ten cryptocurrency addresses controlled by the two individuals — nine for Kondratyev and one for Sungatov. Those addresses are below.</span></p>

<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Authorities have taken down a major player in ransomware</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These law enforcement actions represent a big win in the fight against ransomware. As we’ve explored above, Lockbit was one of the most prolific strains operating for several years — taking down its infrastructure and obtaining decryptor keys will save many organizations from damaging ransomware attacks. We commend all agencies involved.</span></p>

<h2>Transcript</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey, everyone. Welcome to another episode of Public Key. This is your host, Ian Andrews. Today, I&#8217;m joined by two terrific guests, Corey Then, who&#8217;s VP of global policy at Circle, and my colleague and friend, Caroline Malcolm, who is VP of global policy at Chainalysis. Corey, Caroline, welcome to the program.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corey:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks, Ian. Really happy to be here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caroline:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Great to be with you, Ian and Corey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, Corey, super excited to talk. I think this has been the story of the year in 2023. I&#8217;ve been blown away at the shift in the overall digital asset ecosystem where I think now, over 60% of all on-chain transactions involve stablecoins, which is just mind-blowing to think about in that transformation happening in just the last few years. I&#8217;m sure almost everyone listening to this podcast has heard of Circle and your token, USDC. It seems like it&#8217;s everywhere, but I would imagine most people don&#8217;t really understand the business of USDC. Can we maybe start with just a quick overview of how does that actually work? What do you all do that makes money?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corey:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, thanks for the question, Ian. Very good question. We actually have a really simple business model. If you give Circle a dollar, in exchange, you get a USDC. And you can use that USDC to move money more effortlessly on, essentially, newer pipes, the new blockchains that are constantly competing to be faster and better, more functional, cheaper with each other. And that&#8217;s like the real infrastructure upgrade that&#8217;s happening in financial markets. But if you give us that dollar, we take the proceeds, and we put it in high-quality liquid assets held in reserve for our customers, and we make money, essentially, on the float.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have a very large T bill portfolio, and we take the interest off of that portfolio. And then, we also hold reserves in cash held at US regulated banks and in reverse repurchase transactions. So, reverse repos are essentially like an overnight loan typically to banks that are over collateralized by treasuries by like 102 or 103%. All really very low-risk assets to make sure that we can always meet that, show me the money test, the Jerry Maguire test. Probably the most important thing that we do is if you come to us and say, &#8220;I want to exchange my USDC and get my fiat dollar back,&#8221; we need to be able to meet that obligation in a reasonable period of time. And that&#8217;s why we run the business very, very conservatively with very conservative backing assets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah. Amazing. And I would have to imagine as the interest rates have run up in the last year and a half to fight inflation, that just makes your business better, right? Higher interest rate environment increases the return you get on that, those assets you&#8217;re holding in reserve, backing the USDC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corey:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, you&#8217;re right. It does increase the yield there. So, that&#8217;s good for business. I will say it increases the opportunity cost a little bit of holding a USDC. So, there&#8217;s a little bit of give and take there. And we&#8217;re really in favor of getting USDC in more people&#8217;s hands and growing this ecosystem, so you get advantages of scale. I wouldn&#8217;t say that high interest rates are something that we&#8217;re necessarily rooting for, but there&#8217;s an obvious benefit to them as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, fantastic. We&#8217;ll get more into how people are using them and where you see the ecosystem going in the future. But Caroline, I wanted to bring up a conversation that you and I have been having offline. It feels like over the last 18 months, since Terra Luna collapsed, and this was a different flavor of stablecoin, obviously, than what we&#8217;re talking about with USDC today. But at that moment in time, there really was no regulation, I don&#8217;t think, in any market for what is a stablecoin, how do the reserves backing that asset have to be held? But it seems like today, nearly every major market around the world seems to have either adopted a framework describing stablecoins more clearly or is on their way to do so, with maybe the exception of the US, unfortunately. Give us a sense of what&#8217;s the big picture on stablecoins? Are these something that we should expect to still be here in a decade?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caroline:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, Ian, so you&#8217;re absolutely right. 2022, even though it involved what was commonly referred to as a stablecoin, I tend to think of them more as algorithmic tokens. It definitely had a catalyzing effect on regulators, and we&#8217;ve really seen a flurry of both international guidance and standard setting as well as national-level regulation, both in terms of the broader crypto asset or digital asset ecosystem, but also, specific rules relating to stablecoins as well. Maybe a couple, just to highlight, I think probably at that international level, one of the most significant pieces that came out was really the Financial Stability Board&#8217;s work, which was reported to the G20, these high-level recommendations and what they call global stablecoin arrangements. Now, that work, obviously, really had its genesis in some of those very early projects in this space, Libra Diem, but has really evolved since then to focus on what we actually see as the business models like Corey has described that are taking place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And those guidelines are really meant to help national-level regulators as they think about what rules to put in place. What are the principles that they need to take into account? And maybe the other international piece to mention is relating to the BIS&#8217;s Basel committee on banking supervision. It&#8217;s probably a little less well-known, but I think very impactful in terms of market because this is the rules around what banks and other traditional financial institutions, what sort of exposure they can have to digital assets, including stablecoins. And they make a distinction because they do see different risks, much lower risk, obviously, on the stablecoin side and perhaps on those unbacked other digital assets. But they really are going to be critical in terms of how much those traditional financial institutions can get into this space on their own account. We&#8217;re not talking about where they&#8217;re custodying, those rules are really about when they&#8217;re holding on their own account.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then, as you say, we&#8217;ve seen a lot of national-level regulation. I think probably, again, with the exception of the US in particular, I think probably the one which covers one of the biggest markets in the world, and certainly one of the most active markets when it comes to digital assets is in Europe with MiCA. And that&#8217;s obviously got provisions on stablecoins and some more general provisions. But those stablecoin provisions are actually going to start to come into effect in July this year. This is very much 2024 is really the year where that rubber hits the road on a very, very big market. And obviously, we&#8217;ve seen some now specific rules in Singapore, in Hong Kong, in Japan, in the UAE, all relating to stablecoin [inaudible 00:08:06], and of course, need to mention the UK, which after a lot of talk for a number of years about being a global crypto asset hub, we&#8217;ve finally seen some detail in terms of what sort of rules they&#8217;re going to be proposing for stablecoins in general and those very large, what they call systemic or significant stablecoins as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, it&#8217;s amazing to see the progress. Corey, I&#8217;m curious to understand your role more at Circle because one of the things that I&#8217;ve noticed from the outside is you position the company as being the most trusted of the stablecoin issuers. I think you&#8217;ve gone to great lengths to undertake or maybe leap over some of the regulatory hurdles, and you&#8217;re a US-domiciled company. What does it look like to lead policy for the organization?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corey:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, well, thanks for that question. It&#8217;s a fascinating job. It&#8217;s a fantastic job. We like to say, &#8220;The sun never sets on Circle.&#8221; So, we are a global company. That is one of the key features of this innovation is the borderless nature and upgrading things like the correspondent banking system where money moves slowly and is expensive. And really, what we talk about doing is essentially, just changing the form factor of a dollar to something that moves as easily as email. Today, if I have Gmail and I have a friend with Hotmail in Europe, who should probably upgrade to Gmail anyway, but let&#8217;s just say I do, when I hit the Send button, I don&#8217;t expect that it&#8217;s going to take three days or a week to arrive. I don&#8217;t expect it&#8217;s going to be expensive, and I don&#8217;t expect that there&#8217;s going to be a problem like a walled garden problem where the Hotmail can&#8217;t accept the Gmail.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that&#8217;s the way money moves today. Essentially, what we are doing is breaking down borders and breaking down walled gardens. We are active in every one of those countries that Caroline just mentioned, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Europe. Latin America is becoming increasingly important, especially Brazil, which is a huge market, but even markets like Venezuela and Argentina, where there&#8217;s a real thirst for US dollars. Africa is a huge growing market, especially a place like Nigeria with a population of like 150 million people who have a thirst for and upgrade to their money and better access to the financial system as they grow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our collective job really requires us to be very flexible, and facile, and to move quickly. We are working towards a world where hopefully, we get regulatory harmonization between a lot of these places because the last thing that we want is a sort of Balkanized system that decreases the value of the innovation. So, we have to be everything, everywhere, all at once, and we&#8217;re just in constant active engagement to explain our product, explain what it&#8217;s already doing. USDC is in 190 countries five years after its launch. And then, also, that vision of the future of money, and where we&#8217;re going, and why it is going to increase commerce, and be really beneficial to all these different jurisdictions around the world? It&#8217;s the most fascinating job I&#8217;ve ever had. I worked in the White House, that was pretty darn good as well, but the global nature of it is really challenging and fantastic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two follow-up questions on that. I love the vision of making money move at the speed and simplicity of an email. Who&#8217;s not on board with that idea? And when you encounter somebody like that, sketch out what their case is, why that&#8217;s a bad idea.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corey:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, I think any challenge or innovation, there are entrenched interests, and you can guess as to who some of those are. We are trying to add payment system optionality. We are not trying to displace any of the current players, and in fact, we think a lot of them will be good partners over time, but there&#8217;s just, anytime there&#8217;s a new innovation, it takes a lot of explaining for people to understand how it&#8217;s going to fit into the existing system. I think the borderless nature of this innovation also has certain people in the US Congress and beyond, who look at that as a potential problem, especially on AML, KYC types of issues. And that&#8217;s why, and I&#8217;m happy to explain in more detail what we&#8217;ve done at Circle to address some of those concerns, but I do believe that they&#8217;re all bridgeable, and that we&#8217;re ultimately going to get to a system that makes sense, and that&#8217;ll at the same time, upgrades the financial plumbing that we all work through every day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And second follow-up question is on this, you mentioned a potential for a Balkanized system. MiCA, as Caroline mentioned, I think introduces a framework for a euro-denominated stablecoin. I think we&#8217;re seeing the same thing in Japan with a yen-dominated stablecoin. Other markets are putting in place legislation. In Circle&#8217;s view of the world, do you create a Circle token that matches that local currency or does that actually create the Balkanization that you&#8217;re trying to resolve in the current fiat system?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corey:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, so we have a euro-denominated stablecoin, EURC, so have done that. I would say right now, the primary focus is on the dollar because it is the world&#8217;s dominant reserve currency. And I can talk a little bit about that as well because I think the dollar does have a challenge right now, but it&#8217;s still the dominant currency. Even in a place like Japan with a strong yen and the euro, which is obviously one of the world&#8217;s strongest currencies, there&#8217;s still a big demand for dollars. We&#8217;re hoping to get essentially regulatory equivalents for whether we&#8217;re selling to a customer in Europe, a euro coin or a USDC.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that takes a lot of conversations and engagement. But I would say if we had a competitor in the future who&#8217;s a European-based company and they want to sell a euro coin to customers in the United States, we would also hope that they would be treated with equivalents with a USDC sale in the United States. In fact, this is why it&#8217;s really imperative that the US enact payment stablecoin legislation in the very near term because as Caroline noted, the world has begun moving forward. Japan has a law in the books. Europe has a law in the books. Hong Kong and Singapore are going to. The UAE is getting there. But in a lot of our conversations with international regulators, they say, &#8220;Look, we would like to reciprocate with the United States and we&#8217;re just waiting for them.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like it or not, the United States is still the world&#8217;s largest economy and a leader in many ways beyond that. So, the world is looking to us, and fortunately, there&#8217;s been a lot of good work that has been done over the last two years. I feel like on payment stablecoin legislation, we&#8217;re on the five yard line. I love football analogies, and now, we got to punch it in. We got to score that touchdown, so that the whole world can then work together in harmonizing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah. Caroline, I know that you spend a lot of time with central bankers around the world because I sense some of the resistance that maybe Corey and the team at Circle are running into is at the central banker level. I think there&#8217;s two arguments that exist out there. One is that, hey, stablecoins are an extension of the fiat currency. So, if you&#8217;re American and you enjoy dollar dominance around the world and you want to see that continue, well, we need to move that into the digital realm because everything&#8217;s going digital. So, supporting companies like Circle and their efforts to do that, net good for everybody. The other argument is like, no, no, no, no. This is going to undermine monetary policy. It&#8217;s going to wreck the entire central banking system and cause financial chaos for everybody. Am I thinking about that, right? Is that an oversimplification of the two sides of the argument? And who are the folks that are really pro-stablecoin and anti-stablecoin? Where would we find them around the world?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caroline:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, so I think it&#8217;s interesting that when we think about different countries&#8217; approaches, I think countries outside of the US, one of the pieces of feedback I hear quite often is they look to the US, and as Corey has said, they don&#8217;t see any legislation in the place. And they sort of see the US as notwithstanding that has managed to have a very dominant place in terms of US dollar stablecoin. So, dominating the digital economy we see in other parts of the global economy with the US dollar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And yet, there&#8217;s a lot of curiosity about why they haven&#8217;t sought to really action that advantage and take full use of it. And I think there&#8217;s a lot of surprise that the US hasn&#8217;t moved on stablecoin regulation because it would really help them solidify that front-running position that they do have. And I think in the absence of that, you have this much more open field where you are starting to see local regimes which might in some way favor stablecoins issued in local currencies, whether that be in terms of access to reserves, for example, or they simplify the licensing process if you are issuing in a local currency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And I think we are starting to see countries looking to perhaps take some of that market share that we have. And I think the MiCA regime has been very, very clear, and the policy makers were very clear that they didn&#8217;t want to see the dollarization of the digital economy in the same way that they have seen in the institutional economy. Now, we&#8217;ll see how that actually plays out. Circle, as we know, have already issued a euro coin. We&#8217;ll see how that plays in terms of market adoption. But I think from a policy maker&#8217;s perspective, there are definite concerns. And I do think though that those concerns probably shouldn&#8217;t be limited to stablecoins, is very much the challenge of the internet and the borderless era. The idea of things like capital controls, for example. There&#8217;s been many, many ways to circumvent those, unfortunately, from a policy perspective, for people who seek to manage monetary policy through those types of tools.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And we just haven&#8217;t seen them be particularly effective. And I think that&#8217;s even more the case as our economies become more and more natively digital. And then, maybe the last point is just this idea around pro-stablecoin or we&#8217;re seeing countries that pass regulation. Often, I hear when people talk about countries that pass regulation on crypto or on stablecoins, that they&#8217;re sort of pro. And I think that&#8217;s very much a misnomer because that regulation is really about providing safer markets and more consumer protections. And what it does is it&#8217;s recognition of reality. It doesn&#8217;t change the reality, and we know that very clearly from chain analysis data. You don&#8217;t change the levels of adoption through regulation. You change some of the behaviors, but you don&#8217;t change the levels of adoption.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, if you want to make safer markets and more consumer protection, then you need that regulation in place. So, this idea that countries that have gone ahead and created regimes for stablecoins are somehow pro-stablecoins, I&#8217;d probably push back on that because I think it does misrepresent what the regulation is really about. I think it&#8217;s much more realistic and it&#8217;s very forward-looking, but I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re pro-crypto if you pass crypto legislation. I think you pro-consumer, pro-safe markets, but I don&#8217;t think you necessarily need to be pro-crypto, whatever that means.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That&#8217;s a great clarification there, on my point. Corey, did you have, you want to add to that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corey:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was just going to say, I think Caroline hit the nail on the head when she said, &#8220;It&#8217;s a recognition of reality,&#8221; right? USDC, again, in those five short years, has been used to settle more than $13 trillion worth of transactions. I think almost 5 trillion of that was last year. So, it&#8217;s logarithmic growth, and obviously, there are other large stablecoins out there, so people are using these. It&#8217;s not going to go away because there are some inherent advantages. I just think recognition of reality is the right way to think about this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also think that there are a little bit of split decision with central bankers and even within probably the United States Fed, but I&#8217;ll also say, I know from firsthand conversations that some people at the very top of these organizations look at this as a way to compete internationally just building, especially with the dollar on its inherent advantages and just giving it a technological upgrade from either cash, which continues to decrease in circulation. It&#8217;ll probably always be here, but there&#8217;s multiple trillions of dollars still of US cash out there, or something that moves electronically, but on old pipes that are the province of only a few to be able to use and that live in Oracle databases in ones and zeros instead of on a blockchain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah. When I think about competition in this context of the global dollar dominance, it seems like there&#8217;s maybe China and their efforts to move people to a digital yuan, but there&#8217;s also been quite a bit in the press at least, about this coalition of the brick countries coming together in order to create a new global reserve currency. Caroline, maybe we can start with you if you have an opinion here. Is that real and is that something that US policymakers need to be worried about? And then, Corey maybe is a follow-up, how does that fit into the Circle strategy?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caroline:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, look, I think there&#8217;s definitely, as the geopolitical order shifts and all, we&#8217;re certainly in the time of change when it comes to that, there is questions around economic dominance as well as other forms of dominance in the world. And the US has a very significant advantage when it comes to having its own currency as the baseline currency for trade all around the world. So, no question that I think there&#8217;s a number of countries who would certainly envy that position and would like to see that shift. And we&#8217;ve certainly seen efforts in that regard. For example, requirements for certain trade contracts to be denominated in other currencies other than the US dollar, for example. I wonder, though, whether that&#8217;s something that stablecoins will lead or whether they will follow in that regard? Will that agenda really be set by stablecoins? I think it&#8217;s other forces for very significant global forces that will really drive that question rather than stablecoins themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corey:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, I think what Caroline said is totally fair. I do see the Chinese are very deliberate. They have long-term strategies, and so, with the rollout of the digital yuan, some people said, &#8220;Oh, it didn&#8217;t get a lot of uptake.&#8221; They have it in the hands of 300 million people, and they&#8217;ve now begun using it in belt and road initiatives, requiring it in certain cross-border trade. I think it would be underestimating the Chinese to say, &#8220;Yeah, the digital yuan has fallen flat and hasn&#8217;t done what they hope to do.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I do believe that we are competing technologically with our currencies. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s getting good US is the only thing that&#8217;s going to keep the dollar dominant. There&#8217;s all sorts of entrenched things, but if you don&#8217;t compete technologically, that will be a problem, along with some of the other challenges that we have. I also say our view, we like to think about this, one of Dante Disparte&#8217;s really great analogies is you don&#8217;t ask the FAA to make jet engines. They set really high standards for jet engine manufacturers, and then, you let Boeing, and Lockheed, and others compete. If the FAA made jet engines, I would probably drive everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And we think the same thing with currencies. You&#8217;re probably better off having really stringent rules that protect consumers and that create that opportunity for digital dollars to exist in the world, and then, have good private sector companies compete on the basis of trust, and redeemability, and all of the other features that come with this. And I think that&#8217;s why Circle, our strategy is the right one and why we play a really interesting role in global commerce, and that&#8217;s going to continue to increase over time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just with regard to China&#8217;s digital currency, one of the great features of this innovation is programmability, but programmability in the hands of certain governments may not be a good thing. They could, for instance, program away certain freedoms. Maybe they don&#8217;t want people to purchase alcohol, so it doesn&#8217;t work to do that. Or they want to speed up consumption because they see a recession coming. So, they say, &#8220;All of the digital you want in your account will expire at the end of the month if you don&#8217;t spend it.&#8221; It&#8217;s kind of a way of getting almost to a negative interest rate, and we don&#8217;t think that that is probably a good path for consumers globally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had not even thought about those two last considerations. That&#8217;s a little bit terrifying, and I would imagine there&#8217;s some people listening who would then respond to that and say, &#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s why currency shouldn&#8217;t be digital, and it should maybe only be issued by trusted governments.&#8221; The same trust issue you&#8217;re raising with China, I would imagine people would say, &#8220;Well, corporations can&#8217;t be trusted because they&#8217;re just people. There&#8217;s not enough of an institutional structure there.&#8221; I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve had to tackle that challenge before. What&#8217;s the response to that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corey:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, we&#8217;re certainly not going to do any of the things that China might do. That&#8217;s why we need stablecoin legislation, and then, a good federal and state prudential regulators. And I have no fear of that happening with a Circle, or a PayPal, or whomever might come into the US market. That&#8217;s not really a concern for us. I tend to think that there&#8217;s more risk with central bank digital currencies than well-regulated private sector-issued digital dollars and digital euros and the like. Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You mentioned PayPal, and one of my predictions for 2023 that I made a little over a year ago was that we would see a major bank, a traditional financial institution, in the words of crypto folks, issue their own stablecoin. And I think one of the banks in Australia maybe got to that point, but I was probably largely wrong on the guess, right? There wasn&#8217;t HSBC, or Citibank, or one of the major globals. We did see PayPal come into the industry, and I think there&#8217;s been a number of other non-bank issuers who have moved into the market. What&#8217;s your expectation? Do you expect to see banks coming in? Are they partners for Circle who would maybe collaborate on either extending distribution or validating the Circle proposition? Or do you see them as competitors potentially? What&#8217;s your market perspective there?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corey:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, first of all, banks are very important to Circle. We need somewhere to hold reserves. We need banks to be able to settle transactions. And banks are fundamental to society. They always have been. They always will be. They provide very needed services. I do think banks have a sort of special access to existing payment systems, and when you put blockchains into the mix, that adds that optionality. Some banks will like it, some banks won&#8217;t. But I would expect due to the innovation, that in the future, there will be banks that issue stablecoins. And right now, a lot of banks are talking about tokenizing deposits. That&#8217;s a bit different than a stablecoin because it still comes with the liabilities behind it, like any deposit might, that ends up being loaned out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And maybe I should explain something that&#8217;s really fundamental about our business model. It&#8217;s one-to-one backing. So, a dollar comes in, and a dollar goes into reserves, and we don&#8217;t rehypothecate, we don&#8217;t lend it out. Banks in the United States, essentially a dollar comes in, and give or take $12 go out in loans. Fantastic for credit creation, but that&#8217;s called fractionalized reserving. And that&#8217;s the reason why FDIC insurance exists because in the old days, and as we learned recently as well, there can be bank runs because everybody&#8217;s afraid of getting their dollar back. So, our business model is actually inherently less risky than a bank&#8217;s. Doesn&#8217;t mean that a bank business model is bad. In fact, it&#8217;s fantastic. We all like it for mortgages, and car loans, and everything else. They&#8217;re just different.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah. And so, probably a partner in the sense that it facilitates some of the back office operations of Circle, but maybe not where you would white label the infrastructure behind USDC and have a Citi coin that was built on Circle infrastructure. That&#8217;s probably not in the works in the near future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corey:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah. I don&#8217;t ever want to limit what our business might do in the future, because like I said, we do have good relationships with banks. But right now, we&#8217;re very just focused on expanding the USDC and EURC ecosystem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On that topic of expansion, one of the things that we saw in one of our big research projects is to try and look at the grassroots adoption of cryptocurrency around the world. And in the latest edition of that report that we published in the fall, it illustrated that even though overall, I think crypto ecosystem transaction volume and user activity was down in 2023, in markets that were medium income, and particularly those where they were facing high inflation or strongly restrictive capital controls, seemed to maintain similar levels of activity to previous years. They seem to be using cryptocurrency independent of the actual asset prices and broad market sentiment that we get exposed to here in the US. How do you think about stablecoins enabling dollarization of economies, say, in Latin America or some of the Eastern European countries? Is that a trend that you&#8217;re encouraging? Is it something that&#8217;s net good for people?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corey:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I wouldn&#8217;t say it&#8217;s a trend that we&#8217;re encouraging, but we actually have a really cool report coming out called the State of the USDC economy. That has just some fascinating statistics and graphs that show how the use of USDC is increasing exponentially. And you hit on one of those uses, which is as a store of value. If you are in a country with rampant inflation, you would love to get dollars. If you are in a country where you cannot trust a tyrannical government, you would love to get dollars, and people do use it for that. I was a litigator by trade. I used to have a case down in Venezuela. And I remember going there and the moment I got off the plane, I had been warned this could happen, but I was kind of shocked when it did.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The moment I got off the plane, like three or four policemen came over to me and ushered me to a side room, and they tried to get the dollars I was carrying in exchange for their&#8230; Chavez, at the time, was calling them [foreign language 00:36:26], and they had an unnatural peg to the dollar. Everybody knew they might&#8217;ve said like, &#8220;10 Bolivares for a dollar,&#8221; and it was actually 200, right? And I was like, &#8220;I&#8217;m a lawyer.&#8221; No. Right? I&#8217;m not giving you my dollars. But people want dollars around the world despite some of the countries that want to challenge that dominance. And the reality is some countries are already dollarized, and some countries actually welcome dollarization. There are some leaders. In those countries that don&#8217;t, I would say, &#8220;Look, first of all, we are open to discussions about ways that we can address their concerns.&#8221; And then, there&#8217;s also just an element of do better for your population. Maybe you&#8217;re in a world where you have to compete.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, yeah. You&#8217;re tougher than I am. If I was ushered off a plane in a country like Venezuela and told to give all the dollars I had in my pocket, I would do it gladly. Here you go. Take them all, please. I will happily take your Monopoly money in return. Just let me go. I&#8217;ll remember if I need to travel to a hostile country, you&#8217;re coming with me, it sounds like. Caroline, earlier, Corey mentioned anti-money laundering, counter-terrorist financing as being one of the concerns that comes up when you start talking about a global borderless technology like blockchain and an asset like USDC. I think a lot of people go, &#8220;Wow, we&#8217;ve spent all this time building up the sanctions regime and everything else, and is this just going to give people an easy path to walk around it?&#8221; Talk us through how the people are thinking about applying the existing AMLs, CFT regulations into stablecoins specifically.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caroline:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, so I think this is actually really fascinating, Ian, because of all the areas of policy, the AML, their prudential requirements, financial stability, consumer protection, so on and so forth, the one that really went first when it came to crypto, and people call it virtual assets in the AML space, is AML, CFT. This is where we saw policymakers, internationally and nationally, really move first to make sure that this emerging asset actually was going to be subject to some of those requirements. You saw it in countries like the US very early on, as early as 2013, we saw some mentioning of AML requirements applying to this space. And then, of course, we get to an international standard set by the Financial Action Task Force, FATF, in 2019, and really establishing what the rules of the road were when you were dealing with digital assets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the thing that I find really fascinating is that when we think specifically around stablecoin issuers, the guidance on stablecoin issuance when it comes to AML, CFT is actually not particularly extensive. It&#8217;s very extensive in what we think of as the secondary market. So, trading, centralized exchanges, it&#8217;s very clear on what they have to do. Custodians are broken to&#8230; Customer due diligence. You do KYC, you have to do counterparty due diligence, you got to do transaction monitoring. All that&#8217;s very, very clear. When it comes to actual issuers themselves, though, it&#8217;s a little bit more vague. There&#8217;s some references in the standard about some design choices that might have implications for money laundering or terrorism financing risks, for example, whether those networks allow personal wallets or whether the system is permissioned or permissionless. And it&#8217;s also identified some capabilities. So, things like blacklisting. Can you blacklist particular wallet addresses? Can you freeze or burn the currency that might facilitate the issuer in actually meeting the AML, CFT obligations? But it doesn&#8217;t really go so far as to specify in any full degree, what any specific obligations on issuers might be.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, obviously, when it comes to direct redemption, you can imagine they&#8217;re subject to the same requirements in terms of KYC and so forth. When it comes to their immediate counterparties that the issuers have, which are often not very many in number, they&#8217;re having to do that counterparty due diligence, KYC, although often, these are very large institutions. So, if it&#8217;s perhaps not the KYC we most think of, but we haven&#8217;t really seen that kind of clarity about what those obligations might look like. And I think as we look at the year ahead and given the global interest in the very quickly growing stablecoin market, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if we see that as an area where some further details are forthcoming.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even at the national level, we&#8217;re seeing some references in terms of issuers, licensing requirements that they have to comply with AML, CFT, but very, very little detail about what that means. There&#8217;s really just one country that I can think of, and that&#8217;s Japan, which has said that they&#8217;ve made it a requirement that if you issue on a permissionless blockchain, the issuer has to have that ability to freeze or burn the transfer. But that&#8217;s really, as far as I know, the only specific requirement unique to the issuer space. Yeah, I do think it&#8217;s quite an interesting one just given that history I&#8217;ve described.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, Corey, how does Circle approach this? And I think one of the questions I&#8217;m specifically interested in is where Caroline just took us to, this idea of primary market issuance, like the people that can create a new USDC directly with Circle versus the secondary market issuance where I might go to Coinbase and turn some fiat dollars into a USDC. How do you think about what you&#8217;re doing in the AML, CFT world differently maybe in primary and secondary markets?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corey:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s a really good question. First, I should just say that we are fully supportive of&#8230; We think if you are a stablecoin issuer that is issuing a dollar-denominated stablecoin anywhere in the world, that you should follow American financial crimes compliance rules, and you should follow the standards that really the whole world is coalescing around, but that are also enshrined in this draft bill working through Congress right now as far as reserving, redemption, disclosure standards, liquidity, operational risk management. This is why payment stablecoin legislation is so important because it should be illegal to go around the world saying, “This is the equivalent of a dollar, but by the way, it might be backed by Bitcoin and Chinese commercial paper and we don&#8217;t have the staff on hand to do the types of due diligence that you would really need to do on AML, KYC, and those types of things.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The way we approach this is, first of all, Compliance First Company recognizing that this is critical. Nobody wants to be enabling the Lazarus group in North Korea or Hamas. Nobody wants to be enabling fentanyl trafficking with China. And by the way, I think when the policymakers express concern with crypto, it&#8217;s time to start being more specific and calling out bad actors and bad companies rather than crypto writ large, because most of the bad behavior exists with a few. But yeah, we start with Compliance First Company. Out of our roughly 900 employees, we have give or take 125 in compliance. We have a huge legal team. We have a big policy team, so that&#8217;s our ethos.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We spend hundreds of hours KYCing all of our customers. So, there&#8217;s a very rigorous onboarding process. We block list certain countries where you just simply can&#8217;t use USDC. It&#8217;s too high risk of a country. And then, we are very responsive to law enforcement. So, digital dollars are sort of a digital bearer instrument. I don&#8217;t think it would be reasonable to have to follow every transaction that happens on chain. I think people wouldn&#8217;t like that from a privacy perspective, and it&#8217;s also pretty impractical. But you can work with great companies like Chainalysis to understand data flows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then, you can be, like I said, extraordinarily responsive to law enforcement. If they say, &#8220;Look, these addresses are known to be associated with bad actors, we&#8217;re asking you to freeze those,&#8221; we do have the technological capability to do that. And we do do it, and we do it in very short order. What we have done as a company is essentially send a signal to the market that if you&#8217;re using USDC for illicit purposes, there&#8217;s a good chance that you&#8217;re going to get shut down. And I think as a result of that, there&#8217;s been a huge deterrent factor. And folks who want to engage in illicit finance might use cryptocurrencies with much laxer controls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah. It&#8217;s not in their best financial interest to use USDC, given the approach that you all have taken around both compliance and responsiveness to law enforcement. They&#8217;re going to see their attempted gains disappear out from underneath them, which is terrific. Well, we&#8217;re running short of time. Corey, I want to close with my traditional question. What&#8217;s on the horizon for Circle? What should we be looking for that&#8217;s exciting coming here in 2024?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corey:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sure. Well, look, the State of the USDC Economy report, when that comes out, I urge everyone to read it. It really is a fantastic summation of what we&#8217;re doing and where we think the future is going. But like I said, we are really just focused on growing this ecosystem because it is one of these network effects platform businesses. The more people that have it in their hands, you reach this critical mass and grow. So, I just think there&#8217;s going to be deeper and deeper penetration of USDC in all of these markets around the world. I do believe that we&#8217;re going to get payment stablecoin legislation at some point. I don&#8217;t want to make any predictions as to the timing of that, but I think that what&#8217;s the saying that President Obama used to use? The arc of history is long, but it bends towards justice. I think the arc of history here bends towards well-regulated digital dollars, and policymakers around the world have come to recognize that and are really beginning to work together to come up with responsible legislation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, fantastic. We&#8217;re rooting for you, Corey. Caroline, thanks so much for joining us on the show today. It&#8217;s been a terrific conversation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Corey:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, thank you, Ian and Caroline. Really enjoyed it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Caroline:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Great to chat, Corey. Thanks, Ian.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The goal of money laundering is to obscure the criminal origins of funds so that they can be accessed and spent. In the context of cryptocurrency-based crime, that generally means moving funds to services where they can be converted into cash, while often taking extra steps to conceal where the funds came from. Our on-chain analysis of crypto money laundering therefore focuses on two distinct groups of services and on-chain entities:</span><b></b></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Intermediary services and wallets.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This category includes personal wallets, mixers, instant exchangers, various types of DeFi protocols, and other services both legitimate and illicit. Crypto criminals generally use services in this category to hold funds, or to obfuscate their criminal origins, often by obscuring the on-chain link between their source address and their current address.</span></li>
<li><b>Fiat off-ramping services.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This category includes any service where cryptocurrency can be converted into fiat currency, the most common being centralized exchanges. However, it can also include P2P exchanges, gambling services, and crypto ATMs. It’s also important to consider nested services that operate using the infrastructure of centralized exchanges and allow for fiat off-ramping, such as many OTC trade desks.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s important to remember that all of these services have different capabilities and options when it comes to addressing money laundering. Centralized exchanges, for instance, have much more control in that they can freeze funds coming from suspicious or illicit sources. DeFi protocols, however, generally don’t have this option, as they run autonomously and don’t take custody of users’ funds. Of course, DeFi protocols’ decentralized nature also means that blockchain analysts can generally trace funds moving through DeFi protocols to their next stop, which </span><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/blockchain-analysis-trace-through-service-exchange/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">isn’t the case with centralized services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And of course, illicit services purposely facilitating money laundering can generally be stopped only through law enforcement operations or other legal processes. It’s also important to keep in mind that token issuers can play a positive role as well. Stablecoins like </span><a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/266894/tethers-new-sanctions-froze-161-wallets-only-eleven-hold-usdt"><span style="font-weight: 400;">USDT</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/238459/63-million-in-usdc-frozen-by-circle-following-multichain-breach"><span style="font-weight: 400;">USDC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, for instance, have functionalities allowing them to freeze assets held by addresses associated with crime. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With that in mind, let’s look at the key crypto money laundering trends of 2023. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">2023 crypto money laundering: Key trends</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2023, illicit addresses sent $22.2 billion worth of cryptocurrency to services, which is a significant decrease from the $31.5 billion sent in 2022. Some of this drop may be attributed to an overall decrease in crypto transaction volume, both legitimate and illicit. However, the drop in money laundering activity was steeper, at 29.5%, compared to the 14.9% drop in total transaction volume.</span></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-12691" height="531" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/chart-1-laundering-totals-800x531.png" width="800" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, centralized exchanges remain the primary destination for funds sent from illicit addresses, at a rate that has remained relatively stable over the last five years. Over time, the role of illicit services has shrunk, while the share of illicit funds going to DeFi protocols has grown. We attribute this primarily to the overall growth of DeFi generally during the time period, but must also note that DeFi’s inherent transparency generally makes it a poor choice for obfuscating the movement of funds. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">2023 mostly resembled 2022 in terms of the breakdown of service types used for money laundering, but we did see a slight decrease in the share of illicit funds moving to illicit service types, and an increase in funds moving to gambling services and bridge protocols. </span></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-12692" height="432" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/chart-2-laundering-destination-800x432.png" width="800" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, if we zoom in to look at how specific types of crypto criminals laundered money, we can see that there was in fact significant change in some areas. Most notably, we saw a huge increase in the volume of funds sent to cross-chain bridges from addresses associated with stolen funds, a trend we’ll examine in greater detail later. We also observed a substantial increase in funds sent from ransomware to gambling platforms, and in funds sent to bridges from ransomware wallets.</span></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-12693" height="390" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/chart-3-yoy-destination-by-cat-800x390.png" width="800" /></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Money laundering concentration at fiat off-ramps  </span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fiat off-ramping services are important because they’re where criminals can convert their crypto into cash — the culmination of the money laundering process. While there are thousands of off-ramping services in operation, most money laundering activity is concentrated to a select few services. Of all illicit funds sent to off-ramping services in 2023, 71.7% went to just five services, up slightly from 68.7% in 2022.</span></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-12694" height="451" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/chart-4-top-5-services-800x451.png" width="800" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can also go one level deeper and examine money laundering concentration at the deposit address level. </span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Deposit addresses are addresses at centralized services associated with individual users — you can think of them as akin to bank accounts. Examining money laundering activity at the deposit address level therefore lets us get a better sense of the individuals or </span><a href="https://go.chainalysis.com/key-players-in-crypto-report.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">nested services</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> most directly responsible for the majority of crypto money laundering activity. Looking at things through this lens, we can see that money laundering actually became </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">less</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> concentrated at the deposit address level in 2023, even as it became slightly more concentrated at the service level.</span></p>
<figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_12695" style="width: 800px;"><img alt="" class="wp-image-12695 size-medium" height="376" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/chart-5-deposit-addresses-800x376.png" width="800" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-12695">How to read this graph: This graph shows service deposit addresses bucketed by how much total illicit cryptocurrency each address received individually in 2023. Each grey bar represents the number of deposit addresses in the bucket, while each blue bar represents the total illicit cryptocurrency value received by all deposit addresses in the bucket. Using the first bucket as an example, we see that 2,235,329 deposit addresses received between $5 and $100 worth of illicit cryptocurrency, and together all of those deposit addresses received a total of $69.4 million worth of illicit cryptocurrency.</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2023, 109 exchange deposit addresses received over $10 million worth of illicit cryptocurrency each, and collectively, they received $3.4 billion in illicit cryptocurrency. While that still represents significant concentration, in 2022, only 40 addresses received over $10 million in illicit crypto, for a collective total of just under $2.0 billion. In 2022, just 542 deposit addresses received over $1 million in illicit cryptocurrency, for a total of $6.3 billion, which was over half of all illicit value received by centralized exchanges that year. In 2023, 1,425 deposit addresses received over $1 million in illicit cryptocurrency, for a total of $6.7 billion, which accounts for just 46% of all illicit value received by exchanges for the year. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, it’s also worth noting that money laundering concentration differs by criminal type. For instance, CSAM vendors and ransomware operators show a high degree of concentration — just seven deposit addresses account for 51.0% of all value received from CSAM vendors by exchanges, while for ransomware, just nine addresses account for 50.3%. On the other side of the spectrum, scams and darknet markets show much less concentration. Forms of crypto crime displaying higher concentration may be more vulnerable to law enforcement, as their money laundering activity relies on comparatively fewer services that can be disrupted.</span></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-12697" height="499" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/concentration-by-cat-800x499.png" width="800" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, it’s possible that crypto criminals are diversifying their money laundering activity across more nested services or deposit addresses in order to better conceal it from law enforcement and exchange compliance teams. Spreading the activity across more addresses may also be a strategy to lessen the impact of any one deposit address being frozen for suspicious activity. As a result, fighting crypto crime via the targeting of money laundering infrastructure may require greater diligence and understanding of interconnectedness through on-chain activity than in the past, as the activity is more diffuse.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Money laundering tactics changing: Most sophisticated crypto criminals utilizing bridges and mixers</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A big share of crypto money laundering activity is relatively unsophisticated, and consists of bad actors simply sending funds directly to exchanges. We can see this on the </span><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/chainalysis-reactor/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chainalysis Reactor</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> graph below, which shows the now-defunct phone number spoofing service iSpoof — which facilitated over £100 million in scamming activity before being </span><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/ispoof-fraud-investigation-blockchain-analysis/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">shut down by law enforcement</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">  — sending millions in Bitcoin directly to a group of deposit addresses at a centralized exchange.</span></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-12698" height="769" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/ispoof-reactor-laundering-800x769.png" width="800" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, crypto criminals with more sophisticated on-chain laundering skill sets —such as the notorious North Korean cybercriminals associated with hacking gangs like Lazarus Group — tend to utilize a greater variety of crypto services and protocols. Below, we’ll look at two important ways sophisticated bad actors adjusted their money laundering strategy, illustrated through examples from Lazarus Group:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use of a new mixer following Sinbad’s takedown and OFAC designation</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Chain hopping via cross-chain bridges</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s look at both below.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">New mixer: YoMix takes over for Sinbad</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, 2023 saw a decline in funds sent to mixers from illicit addresses, from $1.0 billion in 2022 to $504.3 million in 2023. </span></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-12699" height="525" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/chart-7-mixers-800x525.png" width="800" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Much of this is likely due to law enforcement and regulatory efforts, such as the </span><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/crypto-mixer-sinbad-sactioned-north-korean-laundering/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sanctioning and shutdown of mixer Sinbad</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in November 2023. But sophisticated cybercriminal groups like Lazarus Group have adapted their mixer usage. As we covered in last year’s Crypto Crime Report, Sinbad became a </span><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2022-biggest-year-ever-for-crypto-hacking/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">preferred mixer</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for North Korea-affiliated hackers in 2022, soon after the </span><a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/tornado-cash-sanctions-challenges/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">sanctioning of Tornado Cash</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which had previously been the go-to for these sophisticated cybercriminals. With Sinbad out of the picture, Bitcoin-based mixer YoMix has acted as a replacement. We can see an example of this on the Reactor graph below, which shows a wallet associated with North Korean hacking activity receiving funds from YoMix, whereas it had previously received funds from Sinbad.</span></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-12700" height="429" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/yomix-sinbad-dprk-final-800x429.png" width="800" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, YoMix saw huge growth in 2023, with inflows growing by more than 5x over the course of the year.</span></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-12701" height="524" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/chart-8-yomix-800x524.png" width="800" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Based on Chainalysis data, roughly one third of all YoMix inflows have come from wallets associated with crypto hacks. The growth of YoMix and its embrace by Lazarus Group is a prime example of sophisticated actors’ ability to adapt and find replacement obfuscation services when previously popular ones are shut down.</span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Use of cross-chain bridges </span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cross-chain bridges  allow users to move funds from one blockchain to another. Generally, anyone can access these smart contracts, although in theory a bridge could implement a blacklist. All of this activity happens on-chain, which means that blockchain analysts can trace funds through bridges, as no centralized entity ever takes custody of the funds that move to bridges. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As discussed previously, illicit actors’ use of bridge protocols for money laundering purposes grew substantially in 2023, particularly amongst crypto thieves. </span></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-12702" height="521" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/chart-9-bridges-800x521.png" width="800" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, bridge protocols received $743.8 million in crypto from illicit addresses in 2023, up from just $312.2 million in 2022. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">North Korea-affiliated hackers have been among those to utilize bridges for money laundering the most, and we can see an example of this activity on the Reactor graph below. </span></p>
<p><img alt="" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-12707" height="156" src="https://www.chainalysis.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/bridge-laundering-800x156.png" width="800" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this case, funds associated with the </span><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/24/hackers-steal-100-million-in-crypto-from-harmonys-horizon-bridge.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2022 Harmony hack</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> moved to a popular bridge protocol in May 2023, where they were moved from the Bitcoin blockchain to the Avalanche blockchain. The funds were then swapped for a stablecoin, and then bridged again using a different protocol, this time from the Avalanche blockchain to the TRON blockchain. </span></p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sophisticated bad actors adapt frequently</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The changes in money laundering strategy we’ve seen from crypto criminals like Lazarus Group serve as an important reminder that the most sophisticated illicit actors are always adapting their money laundering strategy and exploiting new kinds of crypto services. Law enforcement and compliance teams can be more effective by studying these new laundering methods and becoming familiar with the on-chain patterns associated with them.</span></p>

<h2><b>Transcript</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br />
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey everyone, welcome to another episode of Public Key. This is your host, Ian Andrews. Today I&#8217;m joined by a really special guest, Alon Goren, who is the founding partner of a new venture studio called Draper Alon Goren blockchain. Alon, welcome to the show.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alon:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for having me. Happy to be here. Very, very excited to hang with you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, let&#8217;s not bury the lead. You just launched a new venture studio in the last two months, I think, at the time we&#8217;re recording here. Given market conditions both within crypto and the broader macro setting, it feels to me as a weird time to launch a new accelerator. But I&#8217;m guessing you&#8217;ve got some really good reasons why this is a great time. Why don&#8217;t we start there?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alon:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, I mean it&#8217;s a bit of a continuation of what I&#8217;ve been doing over the years. I&#8217;ve been partnered with Tim Draper for a very long time, incubating accelerating companies and running an early stage fund in our space. And as we were getting towards the end of the life cycle of the last fund was preparing the future of what&#8217;s next, and decided to continue on this path. And now is an awesome time because of the current environment, right, because of the environment over the last few months, which if you are a diehard, if you were here even for a minute, but we&#8217;ve been here for a long time and you believe in the space long-term, we&#8217;re still crazy early. And my specialty, my sweet spot and where I have the most fun is early stage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And we like to be the earliest. We&#8217;re known amongst our peers in the industry where if you meet some great entrepreneurs or great engineers and it&#8217;s too early for your fund, you introduce them to us, because we&#8217;re the crazy people who will write the first 25K check, write the first 50K check or 100K check to two people in an idea. And we love it because that&#8217;s where we can get in the trenches and almost act as co-founders. And so there&#8217;s never a better time to do that than when the sort of tourists and looky-loos and people who followed the hype are gone because there isn&#8217;t free money falling from the sky right now. And valuations are more reasonable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the diehards who are here for the absolute right reasons are here still, right? They&#8217;re here because it&#8217;s where they want to be because they believe in this space. And so that&#8217;s who we want to hang out with, that&#8217;s who we want to work with. And so now is the greatest time to be incubating companies or investing in early stage companies and finding the true believers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, I knew you&#8217;d have a good reason. I&#8217;m super curious about, you said you go to the earliest of early in terms of stage of company, two people in an idea and you&#8217;re showing up to write a check. How do you pick the good people and good ideas when there&#8217;s nothing there? This is pre-product. I&#8217;m imagining you&#8217;re not seeing a lot of product market fit or you&#8217;re not looking at metrics, none of the normal things that I would evaluate. Is there a business here? Is there a successful business here? Can it grow with more capital? You&#8217;re way upstream of that. What&#8217;s that process of decision making look like for you?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alon:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, a lot of times we don&#8217;t always get it right, but what for me, it&#8217;s always the people and that they&#8217;re attacking a problem that actually exists, that&#8217;s actually an interesting problem. And it&#8217;s a bit non-scientific, right? It&#8217;s passion, right? I understand that If somebody did come to me with, here is our exact plan of what&#8217;s happening in one month, this is going to happen in six months, this is going to happen in two years, this is going to happen and in seven years, we&#8217;re going to sell to JP Morgan, right? I don&#8217;t know, that&#8217;s all good, right? I mean that&#8217;s very educational and properly done. And writing a business plan when you&#8217;re going to college or learning how to write a business plan is one thing, and that can be important to be organized and to have an idea of where you want to go and what you want to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But having done enough startups and being involved in enough startups, you know that you don&#8217;t know. You know that your plan is all good until you start to execute. And even ideas are fine until you start to execute. And everybody has a little bit of this, like my idea is very precious feeling, but what you&#8217;ll learn is the more experienced people are, the more open they are to just throwing the ideas out there and sharing the ideas publicly, because they know the secret sauce. The special part is in executing the idea. So when I meet companies&#8230; And they give me their idea, and I say two people in an idea, but in these times where I grew up in this startup world where if you wanted to do something, a lot of times you would need money because even just having web servers was expensive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Pre-cloud, you had to get a server at a data center and you&#8217;d talk to a company or you yourself would be like, okay, we&#8217;ve got to do a deal to get a rack of servers at the LAX data center and to do this online karaoke company, we&#8217;re going to need 18 dedicated servers. Something that lives in your browser today would actually cost a lot of money and effort, or you would run your own server at home or something. And that couldn&#8217;t actually be your web server because you know your home internet connection wasn&#8217;t good enough for that. So everything that was hard back in the day is something very simple we take for granted now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So two people, and an idea can actually be a prototype, a product or something there. And so there&#8217;s something to show for it. So I can judge people a little bit based on what they&#8217;ve done with nothing at the beginning to prove to me it&#8217;s a worthwhile thing or to prove to themselves it&#8217;s a worthwhile thing. And then the biggest part really is, are these people we think can attack this and do we want to be locked in a room with them for the next 10 years?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because startups take a long time and if you&#8217;re an early stage investor in startups, you&#8217;re looking at a time horizon of on average like eight years to a potential exit. And so if you&#8217;re coming even earlier when we are, we have to assume this is a long game. And if they fail, I want to be first in line to back their next thing too. So I want to be working with someone who I want that long-term relationship with, who I like. And so a lot of those early meetings and things like that have very little to do in terms of due diligence with like you said, with metrics because the metrics don&#8217;t exist quite yet. They might have be some high level metrics. So I understand that they even know the market they&#8217;re going after or where it is, but usually it&#8217;s them giving me an addressable market and me saying you&#8217;re thinking too small. Because we are thinking in the current world, we&#8217;re thinking in a specific categories, but I believe in a world where the blockchain space and crypto in general is ubiquitous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nobody talks about launching an internet startup anymore. But that was 10 years ago, people would talk and be like, what are you doing? Be like, oh, I&#8217;m launching a tech startup or an internet startup. We&#8217;re utilizing social media to raise money on the internet. We would say these things in all seriousness. But at that point, even just 10 years ago, 10 years ago was just started. But no, not even exactly 10 years ago you were not watching a full length movie on Amazon. The filmmakers thought it was bullshit that people wanted to stream movies online. It was not a thing they wanted to be a part of, because they were artists and cinematographers. And I&#8217;m going to let you watch this pixelated streamed on the internet version of my beautiful piece of art. So thinking about how much has changed. So in 10 years ago we would talk about tech startups or internet startups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 10 years, I don&#8217;t think people are going to say, I&#8217;m launching a blockchain startup or a crypto startup. They&#8217;re just going to be launching a new finance company or they&#8217;re going to be launching a collectibles marketplace or a game, right? And I think it&#8217;s just going to be ubiquitous, and even all this AI stuff is going to accelerate it. People are looking at AI, it&#8217;s a new fad. It is. And there&#8217;s a lot of BS and there&#8217;s a lot of looky-loos and all that stuff, which is great because it drives them away from our space a little bit. But the more that exists, the more we&#8217;re going to need proof, the more we&#8217;re going to actually need proof that things are real. And that&#8217;s what crypto is, the actual sense of the word crypto or cryptographic proof and the blockchain and trustless world, all of our big buzzwords address the problems created by it. And I think that that&#8217;s the world we&#8217;re going to live in. So I did a lot of circles around your question, but really it&#8217;s about the people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was great. Yeah, to me, I pulled two parts out of that. One was you want people that you&#8217;re actually excited to work with. I would guess you&#8217;re probably looking for people who have some shared vision to the one you just talked about, this future ubiquity of blockchain, but probably also have some really unique industry technology market insight that is leading them to want to build a company.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alon:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think it&#8217;s maybe market insights. I think you are coming at it from an analytical point of view, and I even talk to our investors about this sometimes. Publicly, especially like Twitter versus LinkedIn or something. But on Twitter, I&#8217;m purposely a bit of a goofball. I will say silly things. I will act kind of dumb. I will goof around and it&#8217;s like a playground and on the surface, and I am very emotion based artistically thinking and thinking about things from that level. But when we are analyzing deals and things like that, I am a nerd for analytics and things like that, and I understand the really deep levels of you know that this type of venture fund outperforms that type of venture fund. Why does early stage outperform late stage? Why does B2B outperform consumer? I understand the metrics and all the things, so I do things very purposefully.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So it seems sometimes on the surface like I&#8217;m goofing around. But I think the founders, it&#8217;s kind of funny there. I think there&#8217;s a pretty direct&#8230; Not a hundred percent of the time, but there&#8217;s a pretty high correlation between founders who aren&#8217;t doing it for the money, they&#8217;re doing it because they&#8217;re very passionate. They might not understand even the full market, like I was saying, do they understand. That&#8217;s not always the most important thing, but they&#8217;re doing it because they have to or they&#8217;re doing it for these reasons of not because they think this is going to be the billion-dollar company idea.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They might also think that or they might sell that, but they truly are there for the right reasons. And it&#8217;s really funny because some of the biggest founders in the world have not done things for that reason. And people who do come to you with all the numbers and all the things, and then they tell you that&#8217;s why they&#8217;re starting the company, if I believe that they&#8217;re doing it for that reason, it&#8217;s harder to get behind them. Because the second things aren&#8217;t working out because things won&#8217;t work out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have kids and read all the books and whatever, but the oh places you&#8217;ll go, Dr. Seuss spoke with like, things aren&#8217;t going to work out every time and there&#8217;s going to be crappy times. There&#8217;s going to be this and there&#8217;s going to be that, but I have your back. That&#8217;s very, very true. The star of world. It&#8217;s always harder to raise money than you expect. It&#8217;s always harder to get customers than you expect. It&#8217;s always harder to break through than you expect. And so you need founders who are these true believers who aren&#8217;t coming to you with the reason why this is a great idea and the reason I want to start this company is because over the next three years, the $7 trillion alternative investment market is going to go digital. That&#8217;s true. But if the main problem and reason they&#8217;re doing it is because of really practical reasons, there&#8217;s going to be a moment six months from now and they go for very practical reasons, I need to quit and get a job because that&#8217;s a more practical decision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so you have to have somebody who is accountable to that passionate idea over very simple practical reasons. I know I diverted from what you were saying, but it really is a big, big driver, at least for us at that crazy early stage. Because at this crazy early stage, things are going to change dramatically over a year or two or three with where they&#8217;re going and what they&#8217;re doing. And you need that person whose North star is a real, real pain point or a real problem or passion they&#8217;re going after.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It sounds like you&#8217;re looking for somebody that has almost an irrational need to create a company and a solution or a product offering beyond meeting your traditional Maslow&#8217;s hierarchy of needs. You&#8217;re going to ignore some of those-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alon:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A thousand percent. And I think we all have it with certain passions, right? I am right now wearing a nardcore t-shirt, nardcore, it stands for Oxnard Hardcore. Oxnard is a small town near where I grew up where these punk bands called themselves nardcore bands. So in the early eighties there were hardcore bands, which are these punk bands. These guys were nardcore bands. They were in a suburb valet. They created their own little category. To this day, I love nardcore bands. I&#8217;m obsessed with punk rock at a very, very irrational way. And one of the kind of tropes in punk rock talked about this before is people didn&#8217;t want to write love songs and things like that. That wasn&#8217;t cool. It&#8217;s a lot of politics, a lot of youth culturey stuff, but there&#8217;s a whole category of songs of basically the love of punk rock.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s a whole category, but you&#8217;re doing it a lot of times not because you love it, not because you want it, but because you absolutely have to and you don&#8217;t even know exactly why. It&#8217;s just who you are to your core. That&#8217;s how a lot of really passionate founders are. I used the example before, like I said something about collectibles marketplace or something like that. You can talk about why it&#8217;s a good business, but the person who would run a business like that isn&#8217;t necessarily&#8230; Maybe later on when it gets to a certain stage, you could hire a really analytical person, professional COO CEO kind of person that understands the metrics and the numbers and can optimize it and make it better and grow it and whatever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the best person to launch a company like that is someone who&#8217;s absolutely obsessed with those collectibles. Somebody who absolutely grew up collecting comic books and to this day has their collection of comic books. They didn&#8217;t buy any of them originally because they went, Ooh, the spawn number one comic book I&#8217;m buying today is going to be worth $1 more tomorrow. That&#8217;s a part of it, but they needed it. It was a part of their culture, their soul, their thing. And that&#8217;s the right person who launches a marketplace like that, on day one at least.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have a copy of Swan number one, just-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alon:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I do too. It&#8217;s funny, until my mom finally, after many years boxed up my room at their house and made it a little office for herself and guest room for when people come to visit, the Spawn number one comic book was one of the ones I had up on my wall actually. It was important to me because it was the most I had spent on a comic book. I think I bought it for $10 at a comic book convention when comic Cons and comic book conventions were in high school gyms before ComicCon was a thing. It was important.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think I got all the first season of Spawn, bought them off the newsstand as they were coming out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alon:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dang, that&#8217;s pretty cool. I was like maybe a few months late to that, but it was a big phenomenon thing and I remember getting it. And I was passionate about comic books, but I wasn&#8217;t super-duper. Something about it for me was it was a collectible, but I was scared to read them because I didn&#8217;t want to kink the corners and mess with them and I would watch the cartoons, the more mainstream stuff, but I still collected them. To me though, what was exciting, because my older brothers collected baseball and basketball cards was when comic book cards got big. I&#8217;ve got the Marvel masterpieces sets and stuff like that in the notebooks at my parents&#8217; house, in those full page sleeves that hold nine cards in each one. I&#8217;ve got a few of those sets of the different ones.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alon:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And of course subscription to Wizard Magazine and all that fun stuff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oh yeah, I remember that. So back to the venture fund, do you look for particular industry trends that you try and invest in? What is getting you excited about what&#8217;s happening in the world of blockchain and crypto today?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alon:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I try to focus, and what&#8217;s great is having a rounded set of partners too in this world. But I try to focus on the things that I just get really super passionate about myself, right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alon:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So we&#8217;ve done things where, for example, in the past I&#8217;ve met incredible entrepreneurs who come to me with ideas. Something like, I don&#8217;t know, medical records on the blockchain or something like that. And there&#8217;s two things that happen, but the main thing is I look at that and I go, &#8220;Holy crap, I love this person.&#8221; I would love to be a part of this crew and have them be a part of our crew and get to grow this with them. But then I go, I don&#8217;t know how to add value here. I don&#8217;t know anything about this world, and it&#8217;s not something I can find myself getting so deeply passionate about and going down the rabbit hole that we&#8217;ve never done any of those deals. Because it just hasn&#8217;t been that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And a part of it also has to do with our business model. Our first check when it goes to companies, it&#8217;s kind of similar-ish. I think we do things specifically for this space that align us with the founders way, way better. But similar-ish in kind of economic terms to what a Techstars or Y Combinator does. And so I&#8217;m asking for a disproportionate amount of equity in a company, at least compared to an angel investor who just writes a 25K check. So if I&#8217;m going to ask for more, I have to be willing to not just give more and bring more to the table, but I do an internal talk. Every time we bring on a new company, we have a sort of investor committee team call thing, and literally, it&#8217;s like an exercise we do out loud and try to keep each other accountable, is what are we bringing to the table? How are we going to add this value?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And if it was our company, could we justify giving this other group 5%, 8%, 10% of our company? So if we&#8217;re to do that, if we&#8217;re willing to take it, we better bring it because we can&#8217;t have the reputation of those other guys. I mean, they have good reputations in their own ways, but I don&#8217;t think it applies to crypto very well. I don&#8217;t think it applies to our culture in our space very well. For the most part, I think they add a lot of value, but they add value for a short period of time and then it&#8217;s a logo on the wall. That&#8217;s not me. I can&#8217;t do that. It just doesn&#8217;t make sense to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So for us, we don&#8217;t do a three, four month program and send people off on their way. We do disproportionately help them more the earlier on you are in a company, but we&#8217;re tied to the company forever. We stay close to them and we try and participate as much as possible. We&#8217;re very active. So it&#8217;s really important to us that we know and understand it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Going back to the real question of categories, the things I&#8217;m really crazy obsessed with is decentralization from just a high level freedom standpoint. I&#8217;m very passionate about it. I want every person in the world, no matter where they&#8217;re born, to have the same opportunities that we get because we&#8217;re so fricking lucky to have been born in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then the problems with our government that I&#8217;m totally willing to highlight and argue and debate and all that, crypto fixes that too if we do it. So I&#8217;m super passionate about any ideas that kind of go that direction, but I also can see past fun stuff too. Like the NFTs and how they apply, not just because it&#8217;s fun and I liked collecting comic books and whatever growing up, and so I like the metaverse and all of those things, but I think they have an application. Like when FaceTime did a better version of Skype and stuff like that. What it did was it kind of fixes the same problem that technology creates. Technology makes us a little less intimate with each other as human beings. Now we can work from home, we can not see each other. We can be insulated and still get all the things we need to live in whatever without leaving the house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what that did was it made it so that you can have really tight close feeling emotional relationships with people no matter where they are in the world. So I had family on the other side of the world growing up. I&#8217;d see them once a year if I was lucky that year. And we would talk on the phone sometimes it was really expensive. If I could have talked to my grandparents over FaceTime, the way that I talk to my cousin that lives in New York, that&#8217;s like my brother, I talk to him on FaceTime is often or more often than I see my brothers who live five miles away. And that&#8217;s a big thing. I think the metaverse and some of these things we do will have the capacity to do that or enable that kind of stuff. But I also can see that the contracts used in an NFT could also apply to intellectual property rights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that also means that it could be used for the title of a home. And I think that I can see past where the more we develop these technology, even for these rudimentary silly fun ideas, the more that technology can be used for bigger and more exciting things. And so I am passionate about those things too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And my last company I did when I quit my day jobs and started doing my own businesses was a crowdfunding company, for lack of a better word. The word crowdfunding didn&#8217;t exist back then. We called it social fundraising. I actually started it while I was working at MySpace back in the day. But when I did that company, I had basically launched away for people to raise money for their small businesses on the internet. And anyone who understood securities laws or lawyers that I knew and things like that came to me and were like, dude, you&#8217;re breaking securities laws. This is illegal.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that was insane to me. I had no idea these rules and laws existed that accredited investor laws, like public solicitation, rules and laws about what you can and can&#8217;t say on the internet. To me, that was just so offensive and insane antithesis to the American dream. I was taught and raised as the kid of immigrants who came in this country, started their own businesses and things like that, that it was offensive. And so a lot of the companies we&#8217;ve done over the years have had to do with streamlining the process of we&#8217;ve come to terms or we have to come to terms that we live in America. A lot of the companies live in America. Certain categories of products like I don&#8217;t know, real estate won&#8217;t be able to be fully defied, decentralized, anonymous, no matter what we want. Because even in the world of digital jurisdictions, there&#8217;s still going to be countries and land and stuff like that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So how do we use this technology to make that burden less of a burden? And how do we push those buttons to compete and force the hand of banks and governments to change the rules and make it so that all of us can participate, whether or not we&#8217;re millionaires? Because two important things, startups and early and small businesses do employ the most amount of people and create the most jobs in the world, whether it&#8217;s here in the United States or abroad. So that&#8217;s really important to foster and really important to help. We want new startups to come in and push the buttons of the incumbents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then two, it is also the greatest category. Going back to numbers, early stage venture investing, early stage investing is the highest performing category. It&#8217;s the longest and the riskiest, but it is the greatest way to create generational wealth. And if you&#8217;re in the United States and you&#8217;re not a millionaire, you&#8217;re not allowed to participate in. That&#8217;s not okay. I&#8217;m very extremely passionate about some of those things like the real world assets and tokenization stuff, which I feel like is a Trojan horse to those things. On the surface level, it&#8217;s like, okay, we&#8217;re playing with the big banks, we&#8217;re acknowledging that they exist and we&#8217;re enabling them in a way. But I think that the more this becomes ubiquitous, the less power they have and that&#8217;s important.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, I think the point you&#8217;re raising about the accredited investor rule in the US is certainly a good one. Because I think the intent of the law obviously was consumer protection. We have people who were, I think the assumption was made less informed, less well-equipped to evaluate the quality of an investment and likely to be targeted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alon:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 1940s, and in the time of&#8230; They literally use the example. It&#8217;s crazy when you talk to politicians or people, and when you look at why the rules were made, they literally talk about you walk into a bar and there&#8217;s a man in the corner smoking a cigar and he sells you railroad stock to a railroad that doesn&#8217;t exist. So that&#8217;s why the rules exist. Okay, you&#8217;ve built these rules and laws to protect people from being scammed instead of maybe making the punishment for scamming people much, much harder. I feel like that&#8217;s a better approach. But now the year is 2023. The amount of money you have does not give you a disproportionate amount of information. You can be a 16-year-old kid spending time on Reddit and learning about a startup and have way more insight and be way better equipped to know if that is a good idea than your parent who&#8217;s a doctor, because the biggest group of accredited investors in our country are doctors, right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alon:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is a doctor well-equipped to make a metaverse investment decision? Or is there child who grew up playing roadblocks or a better equipped person? The kid is better equipped, but the kid&#8217;s not allowed to participate. The parents are. So that doesn&#8217;t exist anymore. And there have been some things. So the rules have changed for the better over the years slightly, but they&#8217;re still random proposals that to me are insanely offensive because they&#8217;ll say things like&#8230; Well, how about this? If you&#8217;re not an accredited investor, you can take a suitability test and see if you are sophisticated enough to make an investment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that&#8217;s insane to me because that&#8217;s like saying if you&#8217;re not a millionaire, you&#8217;re stupid. Or at least if you&#8217;re not a millionaire, we&#8217;re not sure if you&#8217;re smart enough to make an investment. It&#8217;s insane. Either make everything take a suitability test or remove the rule and law. But it&#8217;s definitely in this day and age, not a fair assumption. You don&#8217;t have a rule of going into Vegas, which I think investing in startups is less of a gamble and better, but there&#8217;s no suitability test to go to Vegas. There isn&#8217;t like, oh, well you can afford to lose the money, so we&#8217;re going to let you in. There&#8217;s nothing like that in any other category in the world. So, I understand if you follow the money, why it exists. And it&#8217;s not to protect the investors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We actually had a guest on the program who runs a crypto exchange in Malaysia. And was explaining that in Malaysia, everyone has to take a test-</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alon:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That makes sense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">&#8230; in order to invest. I think it&#8217;s a great idea.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alon:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah. And I don&#8217;t disagree with that. Even, I think if you treat everyone the same, fine, then I can get at least behind the reasoning. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s necessary because we live in a world where you can spend your money at any point in time in on a myriad of irresponsible things. Irresponsible from my perspective. And somebody else might say no, right? It&#8217;s not. But if you&#8217;re going to do it, I understand, or at least, because here&#8217;s the thing, the disclosures that a wealthy person or that a privately fundraising startup forces an investor to check those boxes and do are legalese blocks of text that nobody is taking seriously. It&#8217;s like the, I agree. When your iPhone doesn&#8217;t update, have you ever read it? No, you don&#8217;t care, whatever. But the reason why these rules and laws are important is because the second a startup raises money in a public way, they are actually on the hook to verify that you&#8217;re a credit investor and whatever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So you&#8217;ve added more liability and more hurdles to the company who&#8217;s creating the jobs, who is generating, who is making the country and world a better place, presumptively. You&#8217;re making more hurdles for them versus the person who&#8217;s doing it. And so either the person who&#8217;s making the investment is blocked completely or it&#8217;s a private raise, they get a piece of paper, nobody verifies anything you basically sign an I agree, and nobody verifies it ever. And a lot of accredit investors and angel investors aren&#8217;t actually accredit investors according to the rules and laws because debt cancels out their net worth. And how many people actually have that multimillion dollar net worth and don&#8217;t have debt to cancel it out?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because what you end up finding out is it doesn&#8217;t make sense. That&#8217;s why the largest category of accredit investors is doctors because of how much they make per year. Because you can qualify based on having a net worth or having a high paycheck for a certain period of time. And inflation is helping that a little bit actually, right? Because everyone, at least we hope, is making more to keep up with inflation, but they&#8217;re changing the numbers. They want to change the numbers for inflation to stop more people from investing, which is like of mind-blowing. When I say they, certain politicians and certain people. Some people are pushing against it and in more agreeance with me, but it&#8217;s crazy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So let&#8217;s change gears here and maybe talk about some of the companies that you&#8217;ve invested in recently. I know a big, big one you were sharing on social media was a company called Lunar Crush. What do they do? What got you excited about them?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alon:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah, so Lunar Crush is one of the earliest ones we did. It was really exciting. And full disclosure, I&#8217;m an investor in Lunar Crush. I&#8217;m on the board of Lunar Crush, and I recently led the round of funding in Lunar Crush for us and for the Draper Venture Network, and they&#8217;re kicking butt, and I love them. So what they do, they started 100% in the crypto space, and their premise was awesome. It was in the earliest days of crypto, they were crypto nerds like us, and I met them and hung out with them, and they said, now that all these tokens are going live, all this world exists. How do we know what&#8217;s real? There is no CEO, there is no quarterly earnings report, there is no basic financial analysis of these tokens. In our world, is their GitHub active? Are there engineers participating? Is there a community that&#8217;s actually building or is it just bots posting things online?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of these different ways in which you can get access or understand a public company back then, right? We&#8217;re talking about let&#8217;s say four or five years ago, didn&#8217;t exist for crypto, but then also pre all of this Reddit craziness and Wall Street bet stuff. How do you know that a public stock is also not influenced by public opinion on social media and everywhere else? And why should we only judge what&#8217;s happening there based on the reporting by those companies and based on those quarterly reports or what the CEO says or whatever. And so they started building these sort of social listening tools to see what was being said online and ingest all of that content and then filter out the bots or humans who act as bots. Because there are certain situations in crypto and otherwise where people do things like that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But also then understand the context and the way in which we speak, because we are starting this whole new industry. And we would say things like when moon or whatever, and what does that actually mean? If you took normal just language processing, is that bullish? Is that bearish? Is that good? Is that bad? What happens when somebody says, I got rugged, right? If you took a normal just basic analysis tool, you would never know what that means. And so specific to crypto. Over time they understood these things. They were able to show and demonstrate how social media impacts price and movement and social sentiment and all these things. They&#8217;re able to tell you not just if there was more noise about a specific token. They can tell you not just here&#8217;s how many posts about Bitcoin happened today. But they can tell you how many individual people are discussing Bitcoin today on the internet, which then they can compare to yesterday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And you can say 20% more people are talking about Bitcoin today. That&#8217;s way more important than 20% more posts on the internet about Bitcoin, right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yeah. That&#8217;s kind of incredible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alon:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">New blood in the industry. So they would do all of these things and then provide you that data in different ways. And they, in my opinion, were the best at doing that in an automated fashion. And now what they&#8217;ve done is they&#8217;re expanding into other categories. So you can also use this same information. They added later more financial stuff outside of crypto like stocks, but then they did a version of that where now you can compare all the social data that you could on a stock to anything that&#8217;s comparable to different football teams. Two different political opponents. So now you can rank all of the current people running for president in the next election and see probably more importantly than what the polls are telling you, based on certain topics, just how many specific individual people are talking about them, whether they&#8217;re more bullish about one versus the other and things like that. And that&#8217;s important we learned by Trump becoming president and things like that, that it is a popularity contest. There&#8217;s a lot more to it than just what&#8217;s being said publicly and what people realize.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And we learned that in the public stock market, what people are saying online drives price much more than an earnings report. We know that in crypto, we&#8217;ve known that for a long time, and I think it&#8217;s a part of our culture, but the rest of the world is coming up to it. Coinbase stock was a good example of it during the bear. They&#8217;re correlated to the crypto market for purely emotional purposes. But when crypto dumped, more people sold and Coinbase earned more money in the quarters. Because they earned money on fees, they made more money during some of the times when their price of their stock went down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that doesn&#8217;t make sense. It&#8217;s like saying record revenue and the stock price is down because it has nothing to do&#8230; Not nothing but very little to do with the traditional way in which things are. We see it with GBTC and stuff like that. The price of their holdings is worth more than the stock price, and there&#8217;s a discount to their holdings. And that&#8217;s purely because of emotional reasons and because of social sentiment and human reasons. And so they&#8217;re able to analyze those things and do that stuff and they&#8217;re growing and changing and doing some cool things. I recommend checking it out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s different than what chain analysis does, and it&#8217;s different from a human type of research, but it enables humans to then help make decisions and things like that, which is super fun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will link to Lunar Crush in the show notes. I&#8217;m curious, when you first encountered the team behind Lunar Crush, I imagine pretty early stage, what was your involvement in shaping where that product has gone?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alon:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There&#8217;s two things. We get really involved, but the key word in what we do is amplify. Because I&#8217;ll give my opinion and I&#8217;ll say things. VCs have this weird bad rap at the later stage, especially where they go, okay, they request a board seat, they request control, they request these special terms and things like that. And the reason they do that is because if Ian starts getting funny or going the wrong direction, I can twist his arm and let him know I&#8217;m the boss, or I can fire him, I can replace him, I can whatever. I&#8217;m not that guy. Especially at the early stage, you&#8217;re a crazy person if you try to be that person. You start a company yourself if you want to be in control.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So to me, it&#8217;s about giving my opinion, helping brainstorm. I&#8217;m an early stage startup guy, so I love that. But also knowing that it&#8217;s their company, it&#8217;s their thing and having their back when they make those decisions. These guys are rock stars. I mean, so when I first met John and Joe and Dan, the three main founders, they had a fourth guy named Isaac who&#8217;s incredible also, but he didn&#8217;t end up going full time and he went back and forth. But they knew what they were doing. And I was a little concerned actually because a couple of the guys are really great product guys who actually wrote a really detailed roadmap. And I was like, the roadmap was almost too detailed. It scared me a little bit. They&#8217;re running this like a big corporate when it&#8217;s three people in an idea, but they understand the space and they understood where it was going. And they also understood that, like what I was saying earlier, the North Star might be the North Star, but how you get there is going to change along the way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And so then the next time I met with them, they went, hey, you know that thing in the roadmap? We delayed this thing, we changed this thing, we did this. And I realized they can iterate and evolve. So my involvement in the creation of the idea and stuff like that, I can&#8217;t take any real credit in that sense because these guys really knew what they were doing and are incredible. But I was there to help amplify anything that they were doing and help them along the way. And then make those connections to potential other investors, to other partners, and help them in the growth side of things, and be there when they do need me. And so even now, having worked with them for years, I still am texting with the founding team every other day and I end up being in a meeting with them once every two weeks or so. And then in certain times when this round of funding was going on, being on with them every other day and stuff like that, that&#8217;s generally how it works with all of our companies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazing. One of the other companies that I noticed in your portfolio that was interesting was Ownera. What do they do?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alon:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ownera is awesome as well. So they&#8217;re in that world of tokenization and stuff like that. So it&#8217;s really funny, we actually incubated that company, so I can take maybe a little more credit. But Ami Ben David, the CEO, is really the driving force. But he came to me at one point and we were debating after one of our conferences, I had a Zoom hang with him. He&#8217;s based in London, and he goes&#8230; We were debating the idea of can things continue to be tokenized on Ethereum? Are these public blockchains going to work for this kind of stuff? And he was brainstorming this idea about can we have a blockchain specifically built for ownership? That was the first premise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And I got excited because one of the things that my crowdfunding company had pivoted into over the years before that was wanting to build a network for raising money on the internet for bigger things like funds and institutional products that maybe aren&#8217;t big enough to have their own websites and things. Because this was at a time where stuff like that was hard to build and it was different. And so I thought these smaller funds and institutions are going to raise money on the internet. Maybe we build a private network for it. But it failed miserably in hindsight because nobody trusted us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Part of the secret sauce of the two main people in that world is the actual GPS of the funds, like the general partners of the funds and then the bankers and institutions who help them raise money. The bankers and institutions, their superpower is their Rolodex. They will not trust it to any third party no matter what assurances you give them, because that is their bread and butter. Then same with the general partners of the funds and things like that. So what we realized is only people that were a hundred percent committed to making an investment would come and use that product to then make the investment. And I wanted it to be a destination where you can bring everyone in and show them the docs and all the stuff and the deal rooms and the way things are built now where people are more trustworthy of those things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But if the blockchain existed, and I could prove that Ian is the person who introduced Tim Draper to this website, and because of that, he will earn his fee no matter which product he invests in on our website. That can exist today in the blockchain world. That couldn&#8217;t exist back then, or nobody would&#8217;ve trusted it if we had built something because it&#8217;s not the same world. So I thought, okay, this idea Ami had, if it existed, I could have built that big company that I was super passionate about. So I got excited about it. We started brainstorming this idea. Owner was created, originally was going to be a blockchain for ownership. That was the first concept. But then it evolved over time. And what we realized is that every institution, every jurisdiction, every type of investor is different. And every blockchain is in its own silo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And the first generation of tokenized products would be tokenized on a specific blockchain and only available to purchase on a specific platform like a T Zero or Open Finance. So imagine if in the traditional world you had a piece of paper, and that&#8217;s what I own in a private company, and I can take that piece of paper like people did before Facebook went public and whatever. And with the help of bank or some bankers, I could sell that piece of paper to somebody else in a very inefficient way, but there was not a lot of constraints other than the legal constraints. Tokenizing was supposed to make things more streamlined and easy, but imagine if you bank at Schwab and you have your money in Schwab and you have your Tesla stock in your Schwab account, and you have your 401k and your whatever stuff in your Schwab account.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now what happens if you want to buy SpaceX stock, but to buy SpaceX stocks, you have to take your money from your Schwab account, wire it to an account at Fidelity because you can only buy SpaceX stock on Fidelity. That&#8217;s what the first generation of tokenized funds and products were. I had to actually take my money, go and KYC and set up an account at a whole different new bank to buy a product at that bank, and I couldn&#8217;t then send that product to my other bank or whatever. This isn&#8217;t DeFi. It wasn&#8217;t like crypto, like a same wallet. This is having to have an account at different institutions and none of the institutions talk to each other. That actually took this thing that was supposed to be streamlined and made it harder to actually trade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But that technology is really important. It set the stage to where we are today. But what we realized is these things were happening in silos in different blockchains, and JP Morgan was going to do things on their chain and US Bank might do things on their chain, but then their customers and the products might be in different jurisdictions too. And one person might be a qualified investor, but one other person might not be a qualified investor, but is an accredited investor, and that means they can only participate in certain products.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So as Ownera was navigating this world, they realized all these things existed and a blockchain wasn&#8217;t the most important part, and there is going to be a lot of different blockchains, and we&#8217;re seeing that now with all the L2s and everything else. So that future did it come into existence? What they realized is there needs to be an interoperability layer so that if I am a Fidelity customer and I want to buy a product from a Deutsche Boerse, private markets, tokenized private share of something, a money market fund, a actual startup, a real estate, piece of real estate, whatever, how can I do that utilizing crypto and have instant settlement?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that&#8217;s essentially what Ownera built. One of the things they just launched the other day was actually one of my fellow board members in Owner, Nadav. He actually, with his LRC group, about 500,000 British pounds worth of a tokenized money market fund from a group who tokenized it, through a different financial institution on a different blockchain than the system Tom next that he was actually utilizing for his institution. And they were able to do instant settlement literally on stage at a conference. He bought that 500,000 pounds worth of those shares in that company. And it was very anticlimactic because when technology works, it&#8217;s like flipping on a light switch. It&#8217;s done, right. But it happened and it went cross chain, cross jurisdiction and happened instantly. And that&#8217;s what&#8217;s going to enable our industry to flourish. The ability to buy not just a New York Stock Exchange shares on a specific platform, but shares in every major exchange need to be able to be bought on Robinhood, for Robinhood to make sense, right?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And that&#8217;s what&#8217;s going to happen with these private market groups and institutions. US bank trusts Wells Fargo at least so much to know that Alon, who might be a US Bank customer and Ian who might be a Wells Fargo customer, they&#8217;ve already KYC&#8217;d in those places, those places can verify that each are allowed to participate in a certain kind of transaction and they can enable that transaction and then all of the pieces along the way should be and can be automated now with modern technology. So now you can actually settle these transactions instantly without the human intervention, without all of these pieces. The same way we do DeFi, but across regulated financial institutions. That&#8217;s what Ownera has enabled, and that I think is the Trojan horse to this more borderless world. And that&#8217;s what&#8217;s going to get really interesting, because you&#8217;ll be able to soon go into your Citi account. And just like every bank when you&#8217;re in your bank account, the technology on that website and online system is not a hundred percent proprietary to that bank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s not a special website that&#8217;s just belongs to Wells Fargo. When you&#8217;re in the mortgage section, it&#8217;s powered by one API. When you&#8217;re in this section, it&#8217;s powered by another API. When you&#8217;re in this section, it&#8217;s a white labeled product by this company. And the interoperability happens through these pipes and APIs and whatever. But even in those things, when you feel like there&#8217;s instant settlement in your Schwab account and whatever, it&#8217;s not actually instantly settled. There&#8217;s a certain amount of calculation Schwab is willing, and risk Schwab is willing to take to go, okay, I bought because the shares of this company exist in a different place and we&#8217;re going to act as if it&#8217;s instantly settled in your account, but it actually is taking four or five days to happen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is happening instantly. We can have actual T zero transactions happening across financial institutions globally, which will enable all sorts of interesting thing like buying real estate with Bitcoin. And the person who owns the real estate doesn&#8217;t have to accept the Bitcoin. They can accept the dollar, but me as the Bitcoin holder won&#8217;t have to sell the Bitcoin to dollars, take that risk, pay those fees, and then send the money, wait the period of time and take the execution risk and the risk of all that stuff. These things can happen instantly, and that&#8217;s enabled. So that&#8217;s what Ownera is doing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know it went long. I got excited, but it&#8217;s what Ownera does essentially, is this interoperability layer, and it&#8217;s also open&#8230; They&#8217;re building an open source interoperability layer, which is important. It&#8217;s called FIN P2P. So people who are in that tokenization world should go look that up. They could build adapters for their systems into it so that when somebody tokenizes the product using your system, they&#8217;ll be able to sell it and actually have liquidity across the whole industry. Because that&#8217;s our biggest issue. You can argue that one blockchain versus another is the best technology, but without liquidity and without good products, nobody gives a crap, nobody will use it. That&#8217;s kind of the historical argument with programming languages and platforms and whatevers. You can always argue that one technology is better than the other, but if nobody&#8217;s using it, if it&#8217;s not happening on the computer side, we don&#8217;t win. I mean, it&#8217;s our whole space. We want adoption. We believe it&#8217;s better. Now is the time to make it happen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It sounds like a fascinating company working on a huge problem, which is very exciting to me. So we will make sure to follow it. We&#8217;ve run out of time for our conversation, Alon. It&#8217;s been fascinating to chat with you. Where can people follow along? Because, it seems like you&#8217;re in the middle of some really exciting stuff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alon:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Connect with me. Yeah, so we got some new branding done and everything because the original branding for DGB was literally me goofing around when I was creating the Google presentation for our investors. So we got new branding that&#8217;s really great looking. And about to launch the new website at dgb.vc. But if you follow me on Twitter just @AlonGoren or connect on LinkedIn or whatever, you will see the updates. And if you have an early stage company, if you have an idea, if you&#8217;re just getting started and you don&#8217;t know where to start yet or you&#8217;re just at that crazy early stage, haven&#8217;t raised any money yet, hit me up. I want to hang out with you. I want to see how I can be helpful and please reach out and you could also email me. Just alon@dgb.vc.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazing. We will link all of that in the show notes so people can find it there. Alon, thanks so much. It&#8217;s been great to chat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alon:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Awesome.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Ian:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All right.0</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Alon:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thanks for having me.</span></p>
