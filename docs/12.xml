<div> <br><br>摘要：<br>这些信息是消极的。澳大利亚检察官据称已经撤销安德鲁·福雷斯特对Meta科技巨头的诉讼，指控后者允许使用他的头像在Facebook上发布加密货币诈骗广告。福雷斯特计划继续在加州针对Meta的另一起诉讼，尽管澳大利亚当局已经关闭了这起案件。加密货币诈骗问题仍然是数字资产行业的一个严重问题。 <div>
<p>Australian prosecutors have reportedly dropped Andrew Forrest’s lawsuit against technology giant Meta over the appearance of crypto scam advertisements with his face on Facebook. This development comes as a blow to the Australian billionaire, who is hell-bent on ensuring Meta is held responsible for allegedly allowing bad actors to promote crypto scams using his image.
</p>

<h2>Australian Authorities Throw Out Forrest&#8217;s Case Due To Insufficient Evidence</h2>
<p>In February 2022, Andrew Forrest launched his first lawsuit against Meta, claiming the Silicon Valley-based company had failed to stop scam ads on Facebook from using his image and name. With approval from the Commonwealth Attorney-General Michaelia Cash, Forrest, who also ranks as Australia’s second richest man, was able to file criminal charges against the technology corporation as a private individual.</p>
<p>The mining tycoon, who owns 37% of Fortescue Metals Group, claimed that Meta had committed three offenses against Australia’s anti-money laundering laws as they did not implement the required measures against criminals using his face to advertise crypto <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/google-takes-on-crypto-scammers-legal-action/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">scams</a> to defraud unsuspecting Australian users. </p>
<p>However, according to a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/australian-prosecutors-drop-billionaire-forrests-case-against-meta-2024-04-12/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">recent report</a> by Reuters, Australian prosecutors have now withdrawn Forrest’s lawsuit against the social media enterprise, citing a lack of credible evidence to maintain pursuit of the criminal charges in question. This decision was revealed by a spokesman for the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions on Friday.</p>
<p>Commenting on this development, Andrew Forrest has expressed much disappointment, describing the dismissal of the case as a “tragedy” for the innocent victims who had been defrauded of their hard-earned money by these crypto schemes. On the other hand, Meta stated that the fight against online scams is “complex” but reiterated its commitment against this menace in a bid to continually protect its users.
</p>

<h2>Andrew Forrest Maintains Charge Against Meta Following Setback</h2>
<p>Despite the Australian authorities closing this case, Andrew Forrest remains steadfast in his prosecution of Meta as he has a separate lawsuit against the tech giant in California addressing the same issues.</p>
<p>Although Meta has since petitioned against this case claiming that US laws cannot hold online platforms responsible for their usage by customers or third parties, Forrest claims such laws are effective only within the US borders. The Australian billionaire remains resolute in purchasing this alternative case in the US, stating that over 1000 crypto scam ads have been found on Facebook between April 2023 to November 2023.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Generally, crypto scams remain a notorious problem in the digital asset industry. According to<a href="https://downloads.ctfassets.net/t3wqy70tc3bv/34mVQUo6KAMcKF7rHyRdNM/d6c8710283abad55ec786c56f94eb3d1/Immunefi__Crypto_Losses_in_Q1_2024.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> data from security firm Immunefi</a>, $14.67 million was lost to frauds and scams in Q1 2024. Such figures highlight the need for continuous and necessary development of more innovative and effective blockchain security measures.</p>

<title>VeChain Lands $100 Million Knockout Partnership With UFC – Details</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/vechain-lands-100-million-deal-with-ufc/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/vechain-lands-100-million-deal-with-ufc/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要: 这些信息是积极的。UFC与区块链物流公司VeChain达成为期五年、价值1亿美元的合作协议，使UFC获得了一笔举足轻重的收入，超过了他们以往的赞助记录。这项合作为VeChain提供了全球曝光的绝佳机会，将在175个国家、9亿个电视家庭中获得展示。此外，VeChain成为UFC的官方区块链合作伙伴，其品牌将在UFC活动中得到广泛展示，并将与UFC合作共同创作内容。四处展示品牌标识，运用UFC运动员作为品牌大使，展示风格与技术相结合的合作，展示UFC对创新技术的包容和探索。 <div>
<p>The Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) has landed a heavyweight deal with VeChain, a blockchain logistics firm, in a five-year partnership to the tune of $100 million. This history-making agreement marks UFC&#8217;s first-ever top-level blockchain partnership, while VeChain gains a powerful platform to reach fight fans around the world.</p>

<h2><strong>UFC Flexes Financial Muscle</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.forbesindia.com/article/crypto-made-easy/vechain-signs-a-100-mn-sponsorship-deal-with-ufc/77231/1" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">This strategic alliance</a> injects a significant revenue boost for UFC, exceeding their previous sponsorship records according to UFC&#8217;s senior vice president of global partnerships, Paul Asencio. The deal also positions the MMA giant at the forefront of a burgeoning trend, as the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry continues its meteoric rise.</p>
<h2><strong>VeChain Poised For Global Exposure</strong></h2>
<p>For VeChain, the partnership presents a golden opportunity. Their brand will be thrust into the global spotlight, reaching an estimated 900 million television households across 175 countries.</p>
<p>This unprecedented exposure will be amplified through prominent placement within UFC events, including branding on the iconic Octagon canvas and digital displays. The blockchain firm will also co-create content with UFC for their digital platforms, further solidifying their presence in the combat sports landscape.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-294062" height="527" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/a_60e1b5.png?resize=956%2C527" width="956" /></p>




<strong>A Deeper Dive Into The Partnership</strong>
<p>This partnership goes beyond simple logo placements. VeChain&#8217;s branding will be woven into the very fabric of UFC events. The &#8220;official blockchain partner&#8221; will see their logo displayed prominently within the Octagon, the center stage for all UFC fights. This constant visual reminder will serve as a powerful marketing tool for VeChain, keeping their name at the forefront of fight fans&#8217; minds.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/X4qEjBaf/" width="1835" /></p>

<p>The partnership extends beyond branding and content creation. An annual &#8220;Brand Ambassador Fund&#8221; will offer paid opportunities for UFC athletes to participate in VeChain marketing initiatives. This innovative approach leverages the immense popularity of UFC fighters to further amplify the company&#8217;s reach and connect with a passionate fanbase.</p>
<strong>Not UFC&#8217;s First Crypto Dance</strong>
<p>This isn&#8217;t UFC&#8217;s first foray into the world of cryptocurrency. They previously partnered with Crypto.com, a leading crypto exchange, which resulted in fan bonuses being awarded in Bitcoin. Additionally, UFC collaborated with NFT creator Dapper Labs to release a series of officially licensed non-fungible tokens (NFTs).</p>
<p>These ventures demonstrate UFC&#8217;s willingness to embrace innovative technologies and explore new revenue streams within the ever-evolving financial landscape.</p>

<p>The partnership signifies a pivotal moment in the convergence of professional sports and blockchain technology. As VeChain leverages UFC&#8217;s massive global audience, this deal has the potential to not only propel VeChain&#8217;s brand recognition but also educate fight fans about the possibilities of blockchain technology.</p>

<title>First-Ever Conviction For Crypto Smart Contract Hacking: Nirvana Exploiter Sentenced To 3 Years</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/first-conviction-for-crypto-smart-contract-hacking/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/first-conviction-for-crypto-smart-contract-hacking/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。<br />前安全工程师Shakeeb Ahmed因策划对两个去中心化加密货币交易所（DEXs）进行一系列黑客攻击，窃取价值1200万美元的加密货币而被判入狱三年。这是美国首次针对智能合约黑客攻击的定罪。Ahmed被要求放弃窃取的加密货币并赔偿受影响的交易所。他利用漏洞进行了两起攻击，分别在两个DEXs上窃取了资金。调查揭示，他使用“先进的洗钱技术”掩盖窃取资金的来源和所有权。 Ahmed还是一名美国公民，曾是一家国际科技公司的高级安全工程师。 <div>
<p>After orchestrating a series of hacks on two decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges (DEXs) that stole more than $12 million worth of crypto, former security engineer Shakeeb Ahmed was <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/former-security-engineer-sentenced-three-years-prison-hacking-two-decentralized" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">sentenced</a> today to three years in prison, this is the first-ever smart contract hacking conviction in the US. </p>
<p>Ahmed was also ordered to forfeit the stolen crypto and pay restitution to the affected exchanges.</p>
<h2>Engineer Exploits Crypto Vulnerabilities In $12 Million Hacks</h2>
<p>According to charging documents and court filings, Ahmed conducted two separate attacks on<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/digitex-futures-exchange-ceo-faces-criminal-charges/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> decentralized exchanges</a>. In the first incident, which took place on July 2 and 3, 2022, he manipulated fake pricing data to generate approximately $9 million in inflated fees. Subsequently, Ahmed withdrew these fees in the form of cryptocurrency. </p>
<p>Following the theft, Ahmed communicated with the exchange, offering to return the stolen funds, except $1.5 million, if the exchange did not involve law enforcement.</p>

<p>Shortly after, on July 28, 2022, Ahmed targeted another decentralized exchange called Nirvana Finance. Exploiting a vulnerability in Nirvana&#8217;s <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/former-binance-ceo-faces-delay-in-sentencing/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">smart contracts</a>, he purchased crypto assets at a lower price than intended and promptly resold them back to Nirvana at a higher price. </p>
<p>Despite Nirvana offering a substantial &#8220;bug bounty&#8221; of up to $600,000 for the return of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cybercriminals-make-off-with-81-million-orbit-hack/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">stolen funds</a>, Ahmed demanded $1.4 million. This led to the collapse of the exchange, which had lost all its possessed funds, approximately $3.6 million, due to Ahmed&#8217;s attack.</p>
<h2>From Security Expert To Cybercriminal</h2>
<p>The investigation revealed that Ahmed used &#8220;advanced money laundering techniques” to conceal the source and ownership of the stolen funds. </p>
<p>These included token swap transactions, transferring fraud proceeds from the Solana (SOL) <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-bankman-fried-accused-of-criminal-by-ellison/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">blockchain </a>to the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain through &#8220;bridging,&#8221; converting the funds to Monero, and then using overseas exchanges and cryptocurrency mixers such as Samourai Whirlpool.</p>
<p>Ahmed, a US citizen, held a senior security engineer position at an international technology company at the time of the attacks. His resume showcased expertise in reverse engineering smart contracts and conducting <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sam-bankman-fried-guilty-on-7-criminal-counts/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">blockchain audits</a>, skills that he utilized to execute the hacks. </p>

<p>In addition to the three-year prison term, Ahmed was sentenced to three years of supervised release. He must forfeit approximately $12.3 million, including a significant amount of cryptocurrency, and pay the affected exchanges over $5 million in restitution. Commenting on Shakeeb Ahmed&#8217;s sentencing, US Attorney Damian Williams said </p>
<blockquote><p>Today, Shakeeb Ahmed was sentenced to prison in the first-ever conviction for the hack of a smart contract and ordered to forfeit all of the stolen crypto.  No matter how novel or sophisticated the hack, this Office and our law enforcement partners are committed to following the money and bringing hackers to justice.  And as today’s sentence shows, time in prison — and forfeiture of all the stolen crypto — is the inevitable consequence of such destructive hacks.</p></blockquote>

<title>Crypto Firms $104 Million Collapse: Australian Watchdog After Two Unlicensed Companies</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的<br />根据当地报道，澳大利亚证券与投资委员会（ASIC）已对两家加密公司及其董事提起诉讼，指控它们在该国运营。据称，这些公司参与了一项精心设计的计划，导致投资者损失了价值1.6亿澳元（约合1.04亿美元）。ASIC针对NGS集团公司及其董事布雷特·曼达姆、瑞安·布朗和马克·坦.凯特恩启动了民事程序。这些公司被指控在未获得适当许可的情况下向澳大利亚投资者提供金融服务。ASIC还警告了加密产品行业，称将继续审查这些产品以确保符合监管义务，以保护消费者。最近，调查开始之后，涉及前NASA任务科学家的加密基金遭到破产。多名投资者担忧该基金未获得所需许可并违反了管理投资计划的要求。澳大利亚联邦法院下令冻结了巴拉尼安价值5500万澳元的资产，并要求这位加密基金经理交出他的护照。 <div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">According to local reports, the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (ASIC) has started legal procedures against two crypto companies and their directors for operating <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/red-flag-for-etoro-philippines-investigates/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">unlicensed</a> in the country. Allegedly, the companies participated in an elaborate scheme that resulted in the loss of AU$ 160 million, worth $104 million, from investors.</p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">ASIC After Unlicensed Mining Companies</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Australian regulator commenced civil procedures against the NGS Group companies and their directors, Brett Mendham, Ryan brown, and Mark Ten Caten. The NGS Blockchain crypto mining companies include NGS Crypto, NGS Digital, and NGS Group.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">ASIC <a href="https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/find-a-media-release/2024-releases/24-073mr-asic-obtains-federal-court-orders-appointing-receivers-over-digital-currency-assets-of-blockchain-mining-companies/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">alleges</a> that the NGS companies targeted Australian investors to acquire blockchain mining packages with a fixed-rate return. The regulator also accuses the companies of allegedly encouraging investors to use self-managed super funds (SMSFs) and convert the money into crypto.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">According to the NGS Crypto <a href="https://ngscrypto.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, the company was formed in 2018 as a blockchain firm. As part of the NGS Group, the firm “aims to help members generate consistent returns.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Australian regulator stated in their press release that these financial services are being provided without the proper licensing. Due to this, ASIC is seeking “interim and final injunctions against the NGS Companies.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"> ASIC Chair Joe Longo urged Australian users to consider the risks involving self-managing the SMSFs before using the funds to invest in crypto-related investment products like those offered by the NGS Group.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, ASIC’s Chair warned the industry about the regulator’s standard to scrutinize crypto products:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">These proceedings should also send a message to the crypto industry that products will continue to be scrutinised by ASIC to ensure they comply with regulatory obligations in order to protect consumers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Australian regulator applied to the Federal Court to designate liquidators responsible for the companies’ digital assets. The request was made because the regulator believed the investor’s assets were “at risk of dissipation.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/us-sec-faces-another-legal-blow-ripple-clo/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">the court</a> approved the request and prevented Mendham from leaving the country. The preliminary investigations revealed that over 450 Australians invested AU$62 million, approximately $41 million, through the NGS Companies.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto Funds Busted For Irregularities</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Similarly, over 100 investors are owed over AUD$ 100 million, around $64.6 million, by the now-collapsing DCA Capital, Digital Commodity Assets, and the Digital Commodity Assets Fund.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, investigations started after investors denounced the crypto funds operated by Ash Balanian, an alleged former NASA mission scientist. As a result, liquidators were appointed to the three companies managed by Balanian.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Per the <a href="https://www.theage.com.au/national/victoria/up-to-150-million-at-risk-as-two-aussie-bitcoin-schemes-go-bust-20240411-p5fj62.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, the fund was geared at wealthy investors, requiring a minimum deposit of AU$ 50,000. Investors discovered irregularities in the fund’s management, which resulted in the authorities’ involvement.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Numerous investors were concerned as they considered that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/australian-asset-manager-to-launch-bitcoin-etf-on-cboe-in-q2/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">the funds</a> failed to hold the required licenses and &#8220;breached managed investment scheme requirements.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On Wednesday, the Australian Federal Court ordered the freezing of Balanian’s assets, worth AU$55 million, and the crypto fund manager to hand over his passport.</p>

<title>Litecoin Belief: 62.5% Of All LTC Investors Are HODLers</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/litecoin-belief-62-5-of-all-ltc-investors-hodlers/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/litecoin-belief-62-5-of-all-ltc-investors-hodlers/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。通过链上数据显示，莱特币的长期持有者数量创下新纪录：现在62.5%的所有LTC投资者都符合这些HODLers。数据显示，莱特币网络上的长期持有者数量已经突破500万人，达到5百万。长期持有者通常不轻易抛售，因此对市场具有强劲支撑。长期持有地址数量的增长表明大部分持有者倾向于HODL。当前莱特币的价格约为95美元。 <div>
<p>On-chain data shows that Litecoin&#8217;s long-term holders have achieved a new record: 62.5% of all LTC investors now qualify as these HODLers.</p>
<h2>There Are Now More Than Five Million Litecoin Long-Term Holders</h2>
<p>According to data from the market intelligence platform <a href="https://twitter.com/intotheblock/status/1778713110355788129" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">IntoTheBlock</a>, the LTC network recently reached a new milestone in terms of its long-term holder count.</p>
<p>The &#8220;<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/hodling-steady-bitcoin-long-term-holder-supply-ath/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">long-term holders</a>&#8221; (LTHs) here refer to Bitcoin investors who have held their coins for more than a year without moving or selling them. Note that IntoTheBlock chose this cutoff; other analytics firms have an LTH threshold between 5 and 6 months.</p>

<p>Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell at any point. As such, the LTHs, who hold for relatively long periods, are considered to carry a strong resolve.</p>
<p>Historically, the LTHs rarely show selling activity, regardless of whatever happens in the rest of the market. The fickle-minded part of the sector that holds for relatively low timespans is called the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-short-term-holders-4-5-profits-nov-2021/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">short-term holder</a> (STH) group.</p>
<p>Participating STHs in selloffs isn&#8217;t uncommon; it happens whenever significant volatility emerges, whether in the form of a rally or crash. On the other hand, it can be a notable event when the LTHs sell.</p>
<p>One way to track the behavior of the LTHs is through the total number of addresses that qualify for the cohort. Below is the chart shared by the analytics firm that reveals the trend in this metric for Litecoin since the start of the year.</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Long-Term Holders" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="426" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GK9B71dW4AEpU2w?format=jpg&amp;name=large" width="1716" /></p>

<p>As displayed in the above graph, the number of Litecoin LTH addresses has grown significantly over the last few months and has now reached the 5 million mark.</p>
<p>This means that more than five million LTC wallets haven&#8217;t made any move since at least a year ago. This corresponds to 62.5% of all addresses on the blockchain currently carrying some non-zero balance.</p>
<p>This is a significant amount and suggests that most of the holder base has been interested in HODLing the cryptocurrency. Naturally, supply staying locked in the wallets of these diamond hands can be bullish due to how supply-demand dynamics tend to play out.</p>

<p>Remember that any increases in the LTH addresses don&#8217;t imply that HODLers are currently buying Litecoin. Rather, it suggests that some investors acquired coins a year ago, and they have only now been able to qualify for the group.</p>
<p>Thus, the metric has a delay of 1 year attached between when <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bullish-accumulation-addresses-buying-big/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">accumulation</a> happened and when it registers an increase. Selling doesn&#8217;t carry the same restriction, as investors are immediately ejected from the cohort if they transfer their coins on the network.</p>
<h2>LTC Price</h2>
<p>Litecoin has continued to trade inside a range recently, as its price is currently floating around $95.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Maxi Slams Ethereum ETF: Calls It A ‘Proof-of-Stake Scam’ Unfit For SEC Approval</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。<br />以太坊（ETH）社区急切期待着批准一家预计在五月份开始的以太坊现货交易所交易基金（ETF），然而，美国证券交易委员会（SEC）对此保持着明显的沉默。比特币大力支持者Max Keiser对SEC对以太坊ETF审慎的态度表示怀疑，并认为以太坊是一个“权益证明骗局”且不符合SEC批准要求。另外，Bloomberg的资深ETF分析师Eric Balchunas也表达了对ETH现货ETF获得审批的悲观看法。香港监管机构可能很快批准以太坊ETF，与美国SEC的态度形成对比。愈发增长的全球市场对加密货币投资产品的需求，为投资者提供了新的暴露数字资产市场的途径。 <div>
<p>The Ethereum (ETH) community has continued to eagerly await news on approving a spot Ethereum Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) slated to occur by May.</p>
<p>However, as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) maintains a conspicuous silence on the matter, speculation has risen on the<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sec-delays-decision-on-grayscales-ethereum-etf-here/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> likelihood of the approval</a>.</p>
<p>This speculation is further fuelled by the scarcity of concrete details regarding the approval process, leaving investors and enthusiasts worried and anticipating.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin Maxi Weighs In Ethereum Spot ETF Approval</h2>
<p>In the spot Ethereum ETF debate, notable voices from the cryptocurrency space have offered their perspectives.</p>
<p>Renowned Bitcoin maximalist and advisor to the president of El Salvador, Max Keiser, has recently <a href="https://twitter.com/maxkeiser/status/1778571668887093517?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">expressed</a> skepticism regarding the SEC&#8217;s cautious approach to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/spot-ethereum-etf-delay-is-a-good-thing/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">approving an Ethereum ETF</a>.</p>
<p>Keiser, known for his staunch advocacy of Bitcoin and skepticism towards alternative cryptocurrencies, dismissed Ethereum as a &#8220;proof-of-stake scam,&#8221; suggesting it lacks the regulatory backing necessary for SEC approval.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The SEC is right not to approve an Ethereum (ETH) ETF</p>
<p>It’s a proof-of-stake scam that fails on all requirements the SEC would look for. <a href="https://t.co/nLz8boTGtW" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://t.co/nLz8boTGtW</a></p>
<p>— Max Keiser (@maxkeiser) <a href="https://twitter.com/maxkeiser/status/1778571668887093517?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">April 11, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Keiser&#8217;s sentiment echoes that of Bloomberg’s Senior ETF Analyst, Eric Balchunas, who also recently shared a conservative outlook on the likelihood of an ETH spot ETF receiving regulatory approval.</p>
<p>Balchunas estimated the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-spot-etf-expert-predicts-approval-odds/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">chances of approval at a mere 25%</a>, further fueling uncertainty surrounding the prospect of an Ethereum ETF.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Re Eth ETF approval, we are holding the line at 25% odds altho tbh it is a very pessimistic 25%. The lack of engagement seems to be purposeful vs procrastination.

<p>Additionally, VanEck CEO Jan <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/spot-ethereum-etfs-unlikely-get-sec-approval/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Van Eck expressed anticipation of a potential rejection</a> of their Ethereum ETF application, citing prolonged regulatory reviews and lack of clarity from the SEC.</p>
<h2>Spot ETH ETF Gains Regulatory Interest Overseas</h2>
<p>Amidst the uncertainty surrounding the US SEC&#8217;s stance on Ethereum ETFs, reports suggest a contrasting regulatory environment in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/h-k-seen-approving-bitcoin-ether-etfs-as-soon-as-monday-1.2058422" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>, Hong Kong regulators may soon <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/hong-kong-greenlight-spot-bitcoin-ether-etfs-monday/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">approve exchange-traded funds investing directly in Bitcoin and Ethereum</a>, signaling a potential shift in global regulatory attitudes towards cryptocurrency investment products.</p>
<p>If approved, these ETFs could offer investors new avenues for exposure to the digital asset market. Several firms are poised to launch ETFs pending regulatory clearance from the Securities and Futures Commission.</p>

<p>Among the prospective issuers awaiting approval are international arms of Chinese asset manager Harvest Fund Management Co. and a partnership between Bosera Asset Management (International) Co. and HashKey Capital.</p>

<p>Upon receiving regulatory approval, these firms have indicated their intent to launch ETFs investing in BTC and ETH, highlighting the growing demand for cryptocurrency investment products in global markets.</p>

<title>Pro-XRP Lawyer Deaton Takes The Lead, Outpacing Warren In Pivotal Senate Contest</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/pro-xrp-lawyer-deaton-takes-lead-outpacing-warren/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/pro-xrp-lawyer-deaton-takes-lead-outpacing-warren/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。一位支持XRP的律师和加密倡导者约翰·迪顿正在竞选美国参议院议席，对手是以对加密货币持怀疑态度著称的参议员伊丽莎白·沃伦。迪顿的竞选活动得到了加密行业领袖的大力支持，显示了对加密法规框架变革和对行业态度的转变需求。虽然沃伦具有显著的财政优势，但迪顿受到了加密行业的支持，他的竞选活动将意味着加密货币在美国法规中的未来。 <div>
<p>John Deaton, a pro-XRP lawyer and crypto advocate, is running for a seat in the US Senate against <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-deaton-sen-warren-cover-up-sbf/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Elizabeth Warren</a>, known for her skepticism on cryptocurrencies, when US regulators are stepping up their enforcement actions and crackdowns on the crypto industry.</p>
<p>Notably, Deaton&#8217;s campaign has gained significant support from industry leaders, indicating a growing demand for change in crypto regulation frameworks and a shift in approach towards the industry.</p>
<h2>Crypto Industry Backs Pro-XRP Lawyer’s Senate Campaign</h2>
<p>According to a local <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2024/04/12/nation/john-deaton-loans-campaign-1-million-against-elizabeth-warren/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">report </a>from Boston, Deaton, running as a Republican candidate, has personally loaned his campaign $1 million, showcasing his commitment to his uphill battle against Senator Warren. </p>
<p>Since announcing his candidacy in mid-February, Deaton has also raised $360,690 from individual contributors, leaving him with nearly $1.4 million cash on hand. </p>

<p>According to the Federal Election Commission, Deaton <a href="https://x.com/EleanorTerrett/status/1778797246751904135" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">outraised </a>Warren in the race&#8217;s first quarter, with Deaton raising a total of $1.36 million to Warren&#8217;s $1.1 million.   </p>
<p>Notable donations have come from influential figures such as <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-chief-backs-xrp-lawyer-deaton/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Charles Hoskinson</a>, co-founder of Ethereum; Anthony Scaramucci, former communications director for Donald Trump and vocal crypto investor; and Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, co-founders of Gemini exchange.</p>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/pro-xrp-attorney-deaton-worries-sen-warren/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ripple</a> CEO Brad Garlinghouse and the company&#8217;s executive chairman and co-founder, Chris Larsen, also <a href="https://x.com/sentosumosaba/status/1778792881123426753" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">contributed</a> the maximum $6,600 each, split between the primary and general election campaigns, underscoring Deaton&#8217;s support from key industry players. </p>
<p>However, it should be noted that Deaton faces a challenging campaign against Warren, who has a significant financial advantage with $4.4 million in her campaign <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/pro-xrp-lawyer-coinbase-sec-today/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">war chest</a>. This solidifies her position as the &#8220;heavy favorite&#8221; to win the Senate battle against the pro-XRP attorney in what is considered a &#8220;reliably blue state.&#8221;</p>
<h2>High-Stakes Senate Race</h2>
<p>A spokesperson for Warren emphasized that her campaign is powered by “small-dollar donations,” emphasizing grassroots support rather than “special interests attempting to elevate candidates.” </p>
<p>Nevertheless, Deaton&#8217;s challenge against Warren extends beyond a political rivalry, representing the ongoing debate surrounding the role of cryptocurrencies and their <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/pro-xrp-lawyer-deaton-sec-us-interests/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">regulation</a> in the United States. </p>
<p>Deaton has previously stated, &#8220;Regular people are sick and tired of different rules being applied to Washington insiders. We need real leadership in Washington, DC.&#8221;</p>
<p>Deaton, an ex-US Naval officer from Detroit who attended Eastern Michigan University and New England Law Boston, moved to Massachusetts from Rhode Island in late January, shortly before he announced his Senate candidacy. </p>

<p>While Warren&#8217;s record of service and establishment support pose significant challenges, the crypto industry&#8217;s endorsement and call for change, coupled with the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/john-deaton-prefers-two-cryptos-over-xrp/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">growing adoption</a> of cryptocurrencies, gives Deaton significant leverage in his campaign. </p>
<p>The outcome of this high-profile race will not only determine a political representative but also shape the future of cryptocurrency regulation in the United States.</p>
<img alt="XRP" class="size-medium" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/nrTLfWex/" width="1815" />
<p>As of this writing, XRP is trading at $0.59, marking a significant drop in value over the past month. The cryptocurrency has seen losses of up to 12.4% over the past 30 days.</p>

<title>Crypto Analyst Says Dogecoin Is Poised To Run 100% To $0.4, Here’s When</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-run-100-to-0-4/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-run-100-to-0-4/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要: 这些信息是积极的。<br />近期Dogecoin价格受到抵抗，趋于稳定在 $0.19-$0.2；形成了牛旗形态，暗示价格将翻倍；分析师预计价格将在短期内触及 $0.4，预计4月份将有利多因素推动价格，包括比特币减半。 <div>
<p class="p2">The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-whales-doge-price/">Dogecoin price</a> has continued to trend around the $0.19-$0.2 level after encountering significant resistance from the bears at this level. This has caused a suppressed price action over the last week, stopping the meme coin’s advancement in its tracks. However, the outlook still remains bullish for the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-ethereum-shiba-inu/">DOGE price</a>, with crypto analysts expecting the rally to continue soon and the price to double.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Dogecoin Forms Bull Flag Pattern</h2>
<p class="p2">The Dogecoin performance over the past month has been quite encouraging, and despite hitting a roadblock with its rally, it has continued to show bullish tendencies. The most recent of the bullish moves which the meme coin has pulled is the formation of a bull flag pattern on its chart.</p>

<p class="p2">Crypto analyst Trader Tardigrade <a href="https://x.com/TATrader_Alan/status/1778346751109251372" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">revealed</a> in an X (formerly Twitter) post that the cryptocurrency’s chart had showed something interesting on the daily chart. According to the analysis, the movements that Dogecoin has made over the last few weeks has led to a bull flag formation on the daily chart.</p>
<p class="p2">Now, the main driver of the rally that is supposed to follow this formation is the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-mvrv-ratio-negative/">DOGE price</a> breaking out from the bull flag, which is yet to happen. But as the crypto analyst explains, a breakout from here would send Dogecoin’s price at least 2x higher than its current level.</p>
<p class="p2">A successful break above the $0.205 level would confirm this bullish formation. However, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-shiba-inu-price-red/">DOGE</a> has been unable to achieve this, still <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-stalls-at-0-2-doge/">trading below $0.2 at the time of writing</a>. This could also be a hard-won battle for the meme coin as Bitcoin’s uncertain moves continue to drag the crypto market down.</p>
<h2 class="p2">When Will DOGE Make This Move?</h2>
<p class="p2">The month of April is expected to be bullish for the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-pepe-wif-meme-coin/">Dogecoin price</a>, and the crypto analyst’s price shows this. The expected timeframe for the bullish breakout is sometime this month, which would put it in the next few weeks. Trader Tardigrade’s target shows an over 100% increase from the current price level, reaching as high as $0.4 in the short term.</p>

<p class="p2">This move could be spurred on by the Bitcoin halving happening this month, which is expected to propel bullish sentiment. Expectations for the Bitcoin price are that it will reach $80,000, and this move would no doubt pull up the rest of the crypto market, causing coins like Dogecoin to surge.</p>
<p class="p2">At the time of writing, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-doge-sights-on-0-3/">DOGE price</a> was trending at $0.19, with a 1.61% decrease in the last 24 hours. However, on the weekly time frame, its price is up 14%, coming in second to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/toncoin-flips-cardano-dogecoin/">Toncoin (TON)</a> for the best performer in the top 10.</p>

<title>Binance-backed Gopax Exchange Makes Strides: Revenue Soars 97% Despite Challenges</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/binance-backed-gopax-exchange-makes-strides-reven/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/binance-backed-gopax-exchange-makes-strides-reven/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的<br />Streami的财务报告显示，韩国加密货币交易所Gopax在2023年经历了显着的收入增长和净亏损大幅减少。Gopax去年的净亏损为51.3亿韩元，较前一年的90.6亿韩元有所减少。交易所的收入增长了约97%，达到31亿韩元。尽管面临由于与Genesis Global Capital的关联而带来的挑战，导致巨额损失，但Binance在2023年2月收购了Gopax。此外，尽管Binance近期面临全球监管挑战，但其本地代币BNB的交易价值仍在600美元以上。 <div>
<p>A recent financial <a href="https://dart.fss.or.kr/dsaf001/main.do?rcpNo=20240412001438" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">report</a> from Streami, the parent company of Gopax, revealed that the South Korean cryptocurrency exchange experienced significant revenue growth and a notable reduction in net losses in 2023.</p>
<h2>Gopax&#8217;s Revenue Surge And Net Loss Reduction</h2>
<p>Despite challenges related to liquidity issues and regulatory scrutiny, Gopax narrowed its net loss to 51.3 billion Korean won ($37 million) last year, compared to 90.6 billion won in the previous year.</p>
<p>The financial report further showcased Gopax&#8217;s notable performance in 2023, with a roughly 97% year-over-year growth in revenue, reaching 3.1 billion won. Additionally, the exchange reduced its net operating loss by 78% to approximately 17 billion won.</p>
<p>As reported, these positive results were largely attributed to the resurgence of bullish sentiment in the South Korean crypto market, which emerged as one of the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-05/korean-crypto-traders-influence-jumps-as-won-overtakes-dollar-during-rally" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">&#8220;most active&#8221; crypto markets globally</a> in 2023.</p>
<p>Despite its revenue growth, Gopax encountered notable hurdles, particularly regarding its association with Genesis Global Capital, which had a subsequent halt of withdrawals stemming from a liquidity crisis associated with its involvement in FTX in 2022.</p>
<p>The situation resulted in substantial losses for Gopax, with funds from its GoFi-linked debt stuck in Genesis Global Capital, totaling 63.7 billion won. However, Binance, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-reopens-south-koreas-crypto-market-gopax/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Gopax&#8217;s major shareholder, stepped in to address liquidity issues</a> and &#8220;acquired&#8221; the exchange in February 2023, aiming to penetrate the South Korean market.</p>
<p>According to the report, Binance&#8217;s acquisition positioned the global exchange as the largest shareholder in Gopax, holding a 67.45% stake.</p>
<h2>Binance&#8217;s Global Challenges And Resilience</h2>
<p>However, Binance itself has been navigating regulatory challenges from several corners globally. Among these challenges is the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/changpeng-zhao-ordered-to-surrender-passport/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">$4.3 billion fine settlement</a> with the US Department of Justice and even the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-executive-case-in-nigeria-postponed/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">crackdown from the Nigerian government</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, the crypto exchange has recently <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-users-philippines-face-access-restriction/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">faced a ban from the Philippines Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</a>. As <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/all-crypto-lost-binance-users-cant-retrieve-funds-after-philippines-sec-ban/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">reported</a>, the SEC’s decision was based on Binance’s failure to obtain the necessary license from the commission to operate as an investment and trading platform in the region.</p>
<p>SEC Chairman Emilio Aquino noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>The SEC has identified the aforementioned [Binance] platform and concluded that the public’s continued access to these websites/apps poses a threat to the security of the funds of investing  Filipinos.</p></blockquote>
<p>In response to these regulatory hurdles globally, Binance&#8217;s CEO, Richard Teng, recently<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-ceo-drops-bombshell-announcement/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> outlined a new strategy focused on addressing</a> &#8220;cultural issues&#8221; and &#8220;enhancing compliance efforts.&#8221;</p>

<p>Notably, despite all of these challenges Binance has faced recently, the exchange&#8217;s native token, BNB, has maintained its trading value above $600, boasting green days up by 6.6% in the past 7 days and 2.2% in the past 24 hours with a current market price of $612.</p>

<title>XRP ETF Debate Is Heating Up As Ripple CEO Joins The Conversation</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-etf-debate-ripple-ceo/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-etf-debate-ripple-ceo/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章提到了市场专家对于其他加密货币ETF可能性的看法，包括XRP。加尔林豪斯表示相信将会有其他ETF，并认为XRP和比特币是拥有监管清晰的加密货币。然而，其他专家对于XRP ETF的批准可能性持悲观态度，例如Van Buren Capital的Scott Johnsson认为SEC批准XRP ETF的可能性微乎其微。文章还讨论了XRP ETF可能推迟的原因，如SEC对XRP的保留态度以及XRP在CME上的缺席等因素。James Seyffart指出，XRP期货在CME上的上市可能为XRP ETF铺平道路。 <div>
<p>Since the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/breaking-spot-bitcoin-etfs-approved-by-us-sec/">Spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) were approved</a>, market experts have continued to give their opinions on the possibility of other crypto ETFs, such as an <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-spot-etf-coming-to-the-us/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">XRP ETF</a> launching soon. <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-ceo-battle-sec/#:~:text=Ripple&#039;s%20CEO%2C%20Brad%20Garlinghouse%2C%20has,SEC)%20continues%20to%20heat%20up.">Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse</a> has now joined the conversation, as he recently commented on whether or not the market could witness other crypto funds soon enough. </p>
<h2>“There Will Be Other ETFs”</h2>
<p>Garlinghouse mentioned during an appearance at the Paris Blockchain Week that he “thinks there will be other ETFs.” However, he added that this will take “a little bit of time” because of the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/crypto/sec-announcement-crypto/#:~:text=What%20The%20SEC&#039;s%20Latest%20Announcement%20Means%20For%20The%20Crypto%20Industry,-by%20Scott%20Matherson&amp;text=A%20recent%20announcement%20by%20the,actions%20have%20had%20on%20it." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC)</a> reservations about crypto assets. The Commission is known for its enforcement actions against several crypto projects, including Ripple.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-ceo-dogecoin-details/">Garlinghouse</a> further suggested that XRP would be among those crypto assets with its ETF when the time comes, as he noted that XRP and Bitcoin were the only crypto tokens with regulatory clarity. XRP achieved this status following <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-judge-deems-xrp-sale-non-investment-contract/">Judge Analisa Torres’s ruling</a> that the crypto token wasn’t a security. </p>
<p>Unlike Garlinghouse, some other market experts haven’t sounded optimistic about whether an XRP ETF could come soon. Van Buren Capital&#8217;s general partner, Scott Johnsson, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-sec-spot-xrp-etf/">mentioned</a> that the SEC&#8217;s likelihood of approving an XRP ETF is “very slim.” He further opined that Gary Gensler will need to be replaced before the SEC can approve an XRP ETF.</p>
<p>Ark Invest’s CEO Cathie Wood also <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cathie-wood-bitcoin-is-king-of-security/">once predicted</a> that there would only likely be <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/evaluating-performance-bitcoin-etfs-since-launch/">Bitcoin and Ethereum Spot ETFs</a> in the US, thereby shoving aside the idea of an XRP ETF. Back then, she mentioned that it would be surprising to see “anything but Bitcoin and Ether being approved by the SEC,” possibly due to the SEC’s non-recognition of other crypto assets besides those two.</p>
<h2>What Needs To Happen Before An XRP ETF Can Launch</h2>
<p>In addition to the SEC’s reservations about the XRP token, Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-etf-approved-in-2024/">highlighted</a> another factor that could impede the launch of an XRP ETF. He stated that the absence of XRP on a regulated market like the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-futures-cme-q3-breaks-all-time-highs/">Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME)</a> makes it more unlikely for the SEC to approve an XRP ETF. </p>

<p>His comment relates to the fact that the SEC previously rejected the applications for a Spot Bitcoin ETF on the grounds that they were susceptible to market manipulation. However, in the Grayscale case, the court <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/breaking-grayscale-scores-victory-against-us-sec-spot-bitcoin-etf-imminent/">ruled</a> that the spot and futures markets were correlated. This paved the way for the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/breaking-spot-bitcoin-etfs-approved-by-us-sec/">subsequent approval</a> of these funds since Bitcoin futures were already listed on the CME.</p>
<p>Therefore, the potential listing of XRP futures on the CME could also pave the way for XRP ETFs since issuers can argue that the CME, being a regulated market, can help prevent <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/sec-prove-bitcoin-is-not-manipulated/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">market manipulation</a>. </p>

<title>HashKey Partners With TON Foundation To Enable Toncoin Cash Conversion Through Telegram</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/hashkey-ton-foundation-toncoin-telegram/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/hashkey-ton-foundation-toncoin-telegram/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。<br />在这篇文章中，HashKey集团与Telegram创建的TON基金会宣布了合作伙伴关系，旨在允许亚太地区用户将Toncoin兑换成现金，并探索新的生态项目。该基金会将遵守合规要求，与HashKey合作，在亚洲推广Toncoin。此外，HashKey的全球扩张和在香港证监会获得的升级许可证，使其能够竞争Coinbase的交易量。 Toncoin最近价格为7.14美元，近30天内上涨63%。<br /> <div>
<p>In a significant development, HashKey Group, the operator of one of the two licensed cryptocurrency exchanges in Hong Kong, has announced a collaboration with <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-telegram-admin-compromised/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">The Open Network</a> (TON), the blockchain operator created by Telegram Messenger. </p>
<p>According to a South China Morning Post <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-xl/news/other/telegram-s-blockchain-teams-with-hashkey-in-asia-for-off-ramp-services-to-exchange-toncoin-cryptocurrency-for-cash/ar-BB1lvOUB#:~:text=HashKey%20Group%2C%20operator%20of%20one,so%2Dcalled%20Toncoins%20for%20cash." rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, the partnership aims to allow users in the Asia-Pacific region to exchange their Toncoin for cash, creating an on-ramp and off-ramp for the cryptocurrency. </p>
<p>The agreement also encompasses the joint exploration of new ecosystem projects, mentorship opportunities, networking, and other incubation activities, as the Open Network Foundation announced.</p>
<h2>TON Foundation Prioritizes Compliance </h2>
<p>The Foundation was established following Telegram&#8217;s decision to abandon its TON blockchain due to a <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/16325310/241/securities-and-exchange-commission-v-telegram-group-inc/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">settlement </a>with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2020. </p>
<p>Despite this setback, the foundation has continued to develop the blockchain and integrated it into Telegram through a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/security-firm-warns-of-telegram-bot-token-risks/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">mini app</a> and business arrangements. </p>
<p>Although the Foundation aims to maintain a separate identity from Telegram, its blockchain&#8217;s primary utility remains closely linked to the popular messaging app, which boasts over <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/telegram-unveils-crypto-wallet-800-million-users/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">900 million global users</a>.</p>

<p>The collaboration with HashKey is viewed as a significant opportunity by the TON Foundation. HashKey&#8217;s regulatory compliance measures, particularly in adhering to know-your-customer (KYC) rules, are expected to facilitate the integration of Toncoin into the Telegram ecosystem. </p>
<p>The Open Network Foundation President Steve Yun emphasized the importance of compliance and expressed confidence in “strategically” following the requirements to ensure regulatory adherence.</p>
<p>The Foundation views Telegram&#8217;s “mini app ecosystem” as a crucial driver for adopting its blockchain. Moreover, the blockchain has secured premium real estate within the Telegram app, making its <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/usdt-integration-allows-telegram-users-send-crypto/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">blockchain </a>the default wallet option in the sidebar. </p>
<p>However, the network faces regulatory challenges, restricting the use of the cryptocurrency function within Telegram for individuals in certain jurisdictions, including the US, China, and Hong Kong.</p>
<h2>Asia&#8217;s ‘Super App’ Market For Toncoin Adoption</h2>
<p>According to the report, TON recognizes Asia as a natural fit for its expansion due to the region&#8217;s familiarity with the concept of &#8220;super apps.&#8221; The partnership with HashKey aims to leverage the existing &#8220;super app&#8221; culture prevalent in Asia-Pacific, with renowned platforms such as Line, Kakao, and WeChat. </p>
<p>HashKey recently launched a global <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/telegram-ton-deepen-integration-with-crypto-feature/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">crypto exchange</a> and received an upgraded license from Hong Kong&#8217;s Securities and Futures Commission, enabling it to sell crypto-related investment products to retail investors. </p>
<p>Notably, HashKey aims to surpass Coinbase&#8217;s trading volume by 2030, positioning itself as a formidable competitor in the crypto exchange landscape.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the partnership between HashKey Group and the Open Network Foundation opens new avenues for Toncoin adoption and cash conversion in the Asia-Pacific region. </p>
<p>By integrating Toncoin into the Telegram ecosystem, both organizations aim to cater to millions of potential Asian users who are already familiar with the &#8220;super app&#8221; concept. </p>

<title>Dogecoin Developer Sounds Warning Ahead Of Coinbase’s DOGE And PEPE Futures Listing</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-coinbase-doge-pepe/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-coinbase-doge-pepe/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。<br />加密货币开发者Mishaboar警告投资者远离加密货币杠杆和衍生品市场，特别是在即将到来的高风险时期。他比喻这种交易如同在赌场中玩牌，风险极高。Coinbase宣布将在4月底列出Dogecoin期货，并在4月18日推出Pepe永续期货。这一举动旨在提供更多数字货币交易方式，但Mishaboar认为这将导致市场动荡和更高的风险。 <div>
<p>Dogecoin developer and contributor, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-bitcoin-spot-etfs/">Mishaboar</a> has warned the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-community-doge-day/">Dogecoin community</a> of the risks involved in engaging the cryptocurrency leverages and derivatives market. He explains that the current <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/all/dogecoin-doge-leads-gains-among-top-coins/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">market is too volatile and unpredictable</a> for investors, cautioning that investors could end up losing badly. </p>
<h2>Mishaboar Says “Stay Away” From Crypto Derivatives</h2>
<p>In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, Mishaboar <a href="https://x.com/mishaboar/status/1778259578980835460?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">firmly advised</a> Dogecoin investors and traders to stay away from leverage and derivatives in crypto. The developer’s warning comes amidst the growing anticipation within the Dogecoin community, spurred by Coinbase’s recent announcement of a potential <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-coinbase-futures-listing/">listing for Dogecoin futures</a> this April. </p>

<p>Mishaboar has warned <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-is-bullish-crypto-analyst/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOGE investors</a> to avoid the leverages and derivatives market at all times, but more so in the coming weeks. Responding to an inquiry from community members seeking clarification for his statements, Mishaboar elaborated that cryptocurrency trading is inherently a risky business; however, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-derivatives-hints-historic-2021-performance/">leverages and derivatives market</a> had a higher risk level, to the point of it being unacceptable. </p>
<p>“The unfairness and risk you expose yourself to is not worth it in a market where assets are already so volatile,” Mishaboar wrote. </p>
<p>He <a href="https://x.com/mishaboar/status/1778262175078908256?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">likened</a> trading in this crypto market to playing in a gambling house where the odds are stacked against traders, highlighting that traders would be essentially playing against the owners of the casino as well as <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitmexs-calls-crypto-exchanges-ditch-market-makers/">market makers</a> with access to liquidity and other advantages on their side. </p>
<p>Additionally, Mishaboar explained his reasoning for advising traders to steer clear away of the derivatives market during this period. The Dogecoin developer <a href="https://x.com/mishaboar/status/1778410282349387873?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">highlighted</a> the upcoming <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-halving-a-look-at-post-halving-performance/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Bitcoin halving event</a> as a catalyst for potential market turbulence, stressing that unpredictability and volatility would significantly elevate risks. </p>
<p>He <a href="https://x.com/mishaboar/status/1778409150705291690?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">disclosed</a> that the large influx of liquidity from new markets and conflict of interest from exchanges would also add another layer of complexity in <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/ripple-ceo-5-trillion-in-2024/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">predicting market movements</a>. Moreover, since many players within this market are aiming to utilize <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-whales-doge-price/">Dogecoin</a> to initiate trades, they could be exposed to significant risks that result in them losing all their funds. </p>
<h2>Coinbase To List Dogecoin And Pepe Futures This April</h2>
<p>In a recent blog post, Coinbase, an American crypto exchange, <a href="https://wwwi.coinbase.com/blog/coinbase-derivatives-has-successfully-launched-bitcoin-cash-and-litecoin" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> that it was gearing up to list Dogecoin futures in the later stages of April. This development was made in alignment with Coinbase’s expansion strategy to extend their futures contracts to meet the needs of their growing network of traders. </p>

<p>Additionally, the announcement comes at a time when <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-cash/bitcoin-cash-bch-15-coinbase-futures-listing/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Coinbase launched their new Bitcoin Cash </a>and Litecoin futures contracts. The exchange revealed that expanding its offerings to these cryptocurrencies would improve access to digital asset trading and enable traders to participate with reduced capital within a regulated framework.  </p>
<p>In addition to its upcoming Dogecoin futures listing, Coinbase revealed in an X post published on Thursday that it would be adding support for the popular frog-themed meme coin, Pepe (PEPE), in its perpetual futures offerings. These futures labeled 1000PEPE-PERP will be available for trading on April 18 on Coinbase International Exchange and Coinbase Advanced.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Exchange Deposits Stay Low: Whales Disinterested In Selling?</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-exchange-deposits-low-whales-selling/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-exchange-deposits-low-whales-selling/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要: 这些信息是积极的。最近的数据显示比特币交易所流入量较低，表示鲸鱼不太有兴趣出售。特别是Binance和OKX的比特币存款量较低，暗示持有者不急于出售。此外，比特币价格为每个比特币约70400美元，过去7天上涨超过5%。 <div>
<p>On-chain data shows the Bitcoin exchange inflows have remained low recently, a sign that the whales have been disinterested in selling.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Inflows For Binance &amp; OKX Have Stayed Low Recently</h2>
<p>As pointed out by CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju in a <a href="https://twitter.com/ki_young_ju/status/1778596992924700909" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, the BTC deposits for cryptocurrency exchanges Binance and OKX have been low recently.</p>
<p>The on-chain indicator of interest here is the &#8220;<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-exchange-inflow-mean-spikes-pullback-soon/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">exchange inflow</a>,&#8221; which keeps track of the total amount of Bitcoin that&#8217;s being transferred to the wallets attached to centralized exchanges.</p>

<p>When the value of this metric is high, it means that the investors are depositing a large number of tokens to these platforms right now. As one of the main reasons why holders would transfer to the exchanges is for selling-purposes, this kind of trend can have bearish implications for the asset.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the indicator being low implies these platforms aren&#8217;t observing that many deposits currently. Depending on the trend in the opposite metric, the exchange outflow, such a value may be either bullish or neutral for the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price.</p>
<p>Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin exchange inflow for Binance and OKX over the past few years:</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Binance &amp; OKX Exchange Inflow" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="944" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GK7VguJa8AAL4ry?format=jpg&amp;name=large" width="1396" /></p>

<p>Binance is the largest exchange in the world on the basis of trading volume, while OKX is generally number two behind it in the same metric. While these two platforms certainly don&#8217;t make up for the entire cryptocurrency market, the user behavior on them would still provide an estimation about the wider pattern.</p>
<p>As is visible in the chart, the exchange inflow for Binance and OKX has been at relatively low levels for quite a while now. When BTC observed its rally towards a new all-time high (ATH) earlier in the year, the deposits saw a slight uptrend, but recently, the inflows slumped back to low values.</p>
<p>This would suggest that the appetite for selling, particularly from the whales, just hasn&#8217;t been there for the cryptocurrency. Even the ATH break could only entice a few large users of the platforms to push towards selling.</p>
<p>The behavior is in contrast to, for example, the second half of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-shatters-profit-taking-streak-2021-bull-run/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">2021 bull run</a>, which can be seen in the chart. The rally back then had not only observed some exceptional inflow spikes, but the baseline inflows had also generally been higher than recent levels.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the two major tops of the rally had also coincided pretty well with extremely large inflows, so going by this pattern, the current rally may not be near a top yet.</p>

<p>Though, it remains to be seen whether this same trend would continue to hold for this cycle, given the fresh emergence of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/us-banks-wall-street-giants-buy-bitcoin-etfs/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs)</a>.</p>
<p>The ETFs have provided an alternate means to gain exposure to the asset, meaning that cryptocurrency exchanges may not carry the same relevance in the market anymore.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around $70,400, up more than 5% over the last seven days.</p>

<title>Hong Kong Set To Greenlight Spot Bitcoin And Ether ETFs By Monday: Report</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/hong-kong-greenlight-spot-bitcoin-ether-etfs-monday/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/hong-kong-greenlight-spot-bitcoin-ether-etfs-monday/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。香港即将批准其首批比特币和以太坊现货交易所交易基金（ETF），预计最终批准可能在周一前达成。这标志着香港在亚洲加密货币市场中的关键地位，并凸显了其成为领先数字资产中心的雄心。这些ETF将允许直接投资于实际的比特币和以太坊，采用“实物创建模型”，可降低成本、提高流动性。这将吸引更多投资，与中国和亚洲市场更紧密地融合，并为数字资产营造稳定环境，提升投资者保护。 <div>
<p>Hong Kong is on the cusp of approving its first spot Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) exchange-traded funds (ETFs) with potential final approvals as early as Monday, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-12/hong-kong-bitcoin-ether-etf-approval-expected-as-soon-as-monday" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>, citing two people familiar with the matter. This move positions Hong Kong as a pivotal player in the Asian cryptocurrency market and underscores its ambition to become a leading digital-asset hub.</p>
<h2>Approval For The Spot Bitcoin, ETH ETFs On Monday?</h2>
<p>The Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) of Hong Kong is reportedly finalizing the approval process, with Harvest Global Investments and a partnership between Bosera Asset Management (International) Co. and HashKey Capital poised to receive the first set of approvals. These approvals are contingent upon completing the necessary listing arrangements with Hong Kong Exchanges &amp; Clearing Ltd. (HKEX), aiming for a product launch by the end of April.</p>

<p>Unlike the futures-based crypto ETFs currently available in Hong Kong, these spot-crypto ETFs will allow for direct investment in the actual cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ether. This method could offer a more tangible asset base for investors, contrasting with derivatives-based investments. The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/breaking-spot-bitcoin-etfs-approved-by-us-sec/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">introduction</a> of similar ETFs in the United States on January 11 this year has been linked to increased market activity and significant capital inflows into the sector.</p>
<p>Notably, the upcoming Hong Kong ETFs will utilize an &#8220;in-kind creation model,&#8221; as <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etfs-to-receive-green-light-in-hong-kong/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">reported</a> earlier by Bitcoinist. This model facilitates the actual exchange of cryptocurrencies in the creation and redemption processes, which could reduce costs and improve liquidity—a notable advancement over traditional ETF structures and the US peers.</p>

<p>Moreover, the rollout of these ETFs is strategically timed, as the global crypto community anticipates the upcoming <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/why-bitcoin-halving-could-bring-uncertainty-to-mining-industry/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin Halving</a> event in just eight days, which historically influenced market dynamics. This strategic launch could attract substantial new investments not only by Hong Kongers but also from the wider Chinese and Asian market.</p>
<p>This development follows a series of regulatory advancements in Hong Kong, including the implementation of a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/hong-kong-takes-decisive-crypto-step-preparing/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">regulatory regime</a> for virtual asset service providers and the approval of virtual asset management funds. The introduction of these spot ETFs is seen as a continuation of these efforts to foster a regulated and stable environment for digital assets, enhancing investor protection and integrating digital assets more closely with traditional financial sectors.</p>
<p>According to Singapore-based Matrixport, the investment vehicle could unlock up to $25 billion in demand from Chinese investors through the Southbound Stock Connect program.</p>
<p>At press time, BTC price did not show any major reaction to the news and traded at $70,656.</p>

<title>Grayscale CEO Reveals When GBTC Fees Will Go Down Amid Concerning Outflows</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/grayscale-ceo-gbtc-fees/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/grayscale-ceo-gbtc-fees/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。 Grayscale的首席执行官透露，当公司的资金开始成熟时，他们将降低GBTC基金的费用。GBTC目前有最高的管理费，但CEO对此并不担忧，认为市场还有很大的增长空间。然而，GBTC的资金外流量持续增加，尽管CEO表示这种情况已经开始达到平衡。尽管GBTC面临15亿美元的资金外流，但仍然是所有Spot比特币ETF发行者中持有最多比特币的。 <div>
<p>Grayscale’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etf-outflows-equilibrium-grayscale/">Michael Sonnenshein</a> recently revealed when his company will reduce fund fees for the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/gbtc-bitcoin-reaches-largest-discount-ever/">Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC)</a>. His statement comes amid concerns about outflows from the fund, which have continued to<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crash-10-69000/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> overwhelm the Bitcoin ecosystem</a>. </p>
<h2>GBTC Fees Will Drop When This Happens</h2>
<p>According to a Cointelegraph <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/gbtc-fee-drop-when-bitcoin-etfs-mature-grayscale-ceo" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">report</a>, Sonnenshein mentioned during an interview at Canaccord Genuity’s Digital Assets Symposium that GBTC fees will only drop when the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/without-spot-bitcoin-etfs-btc-down-20-founder/">Spot Bitcoin ETFs</a> “start to mature.” GBTC has the highest fees among all the Spot Bitcoin ETFs with a management fee of 1.5%, compared to the others, which have fees that range between 0.19% to 0.39%.</p>

<p>However, Grayscale’s CEO doesn’t look so concerned. He said he is happy to wait despite GBTC boasting the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/fidelity-gbtc-spot-bitcoin-etfs/">most outflows</a> among its competition, an occurrence which could be partly due to its high fees. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sonnenshein elaborated on what it means for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/these-new-spot-bitcoin-etfs-now-hold-nearly-of-btc/">Spot Bitcoin ETFs</a> to mature. He remarked that the market will consolidate once this happens, and investors will shift their attention to only a few of these ETFs. For now, he believes that these products are still in the first wave of adoption, and <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/institutional-buyers-of-bitcoin/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">investors are still underinvested</a> in them. </p>
<p>“Those things really haven’t started happening yet,” Sonnenshein claimed while suggesting there will be so much room for growth for these Spot Bitcoin ETFs. Once this first wave of adoption, he stated that fees would come down over time, which would also cause them to reduce fees on GBTC. He further suggested that this next phase of adoption. </p>
<h2>Grayscale Spot Bitcoin ETF Outflows On The Rise</h2>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/grayscale-bitcoin-etf-outflows-end-experts/">Grayscale’s GBTC outflows</a> are again on the rise, having slowed at some point last month. <a href="https://x.com/FarsideUK/status/1777542923363430592" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Data</a> from Farside Investors shows that the fund has recorded net outflows this week. Its largest outflow this week came on April 8, with $303.3 million flowing out of the fund. Meanwhile, it recorded an outflow of $154.9 million, $17.5 million, and $124.9 million on April 9, 10, and 11, respectively. </p>

<p>The rise in GBTC’s outflows follows Michael Sonnenshein’s recent interview, in which he <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etf-outflows-equilibrium-grayscale/">shared</a> his belief that the fund has begun to reach an equilibrium. He stated that some of the anticipated outflows are largely behind them now. </p>
<p>Since <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/breaking-spot-bitcoin-etfs-approved-by-us-sec/">converting to a Spot Bitcoin ETF</a>, GBTC has experienced over $15 billion in outflows, negatively impacting Bitcoin’s price at different times. Grayscale has had to offload some of its Bitcoin holdings to fulfill these redemptions, adding significant selling pressure on the flagship crypto. </p>
<p>Interestingly, Grayscale still <a href="https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/explorer/entity/grayscale" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">holds the most BTC</a> (319,252 BTC) among all the Spot Bitcoin ETF issuers. This is because it had a first-mover advantage, having operated as a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/gbtc-bitcoin-reaches-largest-discount-ever/">close-end fund</a> before the Spot Bitcoin ETFs <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/breaking-spot-bitcoin-etfs-approved-by-us-sec/">were approved</a> on January 11.  </p>

<title>Court Denies US SEC Disgorgement Powers In Govil Verdict: Ripple CLO</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/us-sec-faces-another-legal-blow-ripple-clo/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/us-sec-faces-another-legal-blow-ripple-clo/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章介绍了Ripple首席法律官对第二巡回上诉法院对美国证券交易委员会（SEC）和Govil案件的关键裁定的重大转变。裁定表明SEC在Govil案件中继续遭受法律打击，法院拒绝重新审视其对SEC的要求。该裁决强调SEC在涉及证券违规行为时无法要求卖方支付未实际损害买方的利润。这对加密货币行业和监管执法策略具有重要影响，也突显了法律纠纷和监管不确定性对企业的影响。<br /> <div>
<p>In a noteworthy shift in the financial regulatory legal field, Ripple Chief Legal Officer (CLO) <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-clo-coinbase-vs-sec-is-far-from-over/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Stuart Alderoty</a> has announced a crucial ruling by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals regarding the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Govil case. Particularly, this decision concerns the power of the regulatory watchdog to request disgorgement, an important tool for enforcement, in situations involving securities offenses.</p>
<h2>Ripple CLO Highlights Setback For US SEC</h2>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-clo-federal-judge-ruling-no-impact-xrp/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ripple CLO</a> Stuart Alderoty, <a href="https://x.com/s_alderoty/status/1778445159870726511" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reported</a> that the Commission keeps suffering legal defeats in the Govil case. According to Aldeorty, the agency experienced another setback after the Second Circuit Court of Appeals declined to reexamine its ruling in Govil, which maintained that the SEC is not entitled to disgorgement from the seller if there is no financial harm to the buyer.</p>
<p>The filing read:</p>
<blockquote><p>Appellee, Securities and Exchange Commission, filed a petition for panel rehearing, or, in the alternative, for rehearing en banc. The panel that determined the appeal has considered the request for panel rehearing, and the active members of the Court have considered the request for rehearing en banc. It is hereby ordered that the petition is denied.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notably, the agency previously suffered a setback, which Alderoty drew the community&#8217;s attention to in his X post. In November last year, the SEC accused Govil of inducing his former company, Cemtrex, to issue securities under pretenses, promising investors that the $7.3 million they contributed would be used for business expenses. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, they were utilized to support other business endeavors and the defendant&#8217;s personal fees. As part of a settlement, Govil offered all of its shares in the company, which both entities estimated to be worth roughly $5.6 million. It also gave Cemtrex an extra $1.5 million in the form of a secured promissory note.</p>
<p>Consequently, the SEC demanded $5.8 million in disgorgement minus the promissory note&#8217;s face value. However, the Court ruled that the SEC cannot request a crushing disgorgement award without first demonstrating that &#8220;investors&#8221; had sustained financial harm. This is because there will be no penalties without concrete proof of harm.</p>
<p>Alderoty reporting of this verdict highlights its ramifications for the cryptocurrency sector as a whole, as well as regulatory enforcement tactics. Furthermore, it underlines the ongoing legal disputes and regulatory uncertainty that firms like <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-emerge-tether-upcoming-stablecoin-launch/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ripple</a> must deal with in the context of changing regulatory frameworks.</p>
<h2>What This Could Mean For The Regulatory Body</h2>
<p>These negative developments do not look good for the Commission, as they could be viewed as inaccurate decisions from the body. Additionally, it can also be considered an abuse of authority since there are already speculations that the SEC enforcement actions are exceeding its jurisdiction.</p>

<p>With the Commission&#8217;s recent legal misfortune, Ripple and its devoted community are commemorating the major win. This is because it could result in a better outcome for their continuing <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-vs-sec-attorney-disgorgement-is-unlikely/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">dispute</a> with the SEC.</p>

<title>Ethereum Vulnerable To Attack With Just 33% ETH Staked, Expert Warns</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-vulnerable-attack-just-33-eth-staked/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-vulnerable-attack-just-33-eth-staked/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />研究人员Christine Kim进行的一项调查揭示了以太坊社区对区块链经济安全性的重大误解。文章详细介绍了以太坊的经济安全风险，并强调了Proof-of-Stake机制的漏洞。另外，以太坊抵押产生的3个趋势也被讨论：重新抵押的流行度增加，Lido在市场份额下降，中心化交易所抵押下降。文章强调了社区意识和技术安全措施的重要性，以保持以太坊网络的安全和完整性。 <div>
<p>A recent poll conducted by Christine Kim, a researcher at Galaxy Digital, has revealed significant misconceptions within the Ethereum community regarding the blockchain&#8217;s economic security. The poll, which asked the crypto community to assess the security threshold of ETH staked in securing the blockchain, indicated a lack of awareness about the actual risks of an attack.</p>
<p>Respondents to the <a href="https://twitter.com/christine_dkim/status/1778530640381854183" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">poll</a> displayed the following beliefs about Ethereum&#8217;s security:</p>
<ul>
<li>44.9% believed that securing Ethereum requires 100% of all ETH staked, amounting to $110 billion, 31.4 million ETH.</li>
<li>20.4% thought 66.6% of staked ETH was sufficient, equivalent to $73.4 billion, 20.9 million ETH.</li>
<li>34.7% felt that only 33.3% of staked ETH, or $36.7 billion, 10.4 million ETH, was required for security.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How Vulnerable Is Ethereum?</h2>
<p>Addressing these misconceptions, Christine Kim emphasized the actual vulnerabilities of Ethereum&#8217;s Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism in a detailed follow-up on X. Kim highlighted, “You don&#8217;t need 100% of ETH staked to attack Ethereum. <b>33% is enough to disrupt finality, 50% to prolong a chain split, and 66% to double spend</b>.&#8221;</p>
<p>She added, &#8220;Security primarily depends on the network&#8217;s ability to penalize stakers by burning large amounts of the value they&#8217;ve locked. The worse the attack, the more value stakers stand to lose. It&#8217;s important to understand what&#8217;s really at stake here (pun fully intended).”</p>

<p>Further elaboration from the Ethereum Foundation explains the technical underpinnings of these vulnerabilities. An article by the foundation, referenced by Kim, states, &#8220;Attackers using <b>&gt;= 33% of the total stake</b> make all of the attacks mentioned previously more likely to succeed&#8230; 33% of the staked ether is a benchmark for an attacker because with anything greater than this amount they have the ability to prevent the chain from finalizing without having to finely control the actions of the other validators.&#8221;</p>
<p>For attacks involving <b>34% of the total stake</b>, the article detailed a possible scenario of &#8220;double finality&#8221; where an attacker can manipulate the validation of two conflicting blockchain forks simultaneously. This form of attack is characterized by significant coordination and control over the timing of messages within the network, posing a high risk due to potential slashing of the attacker&#8217;s entire staked amount.</p>
<p>Higher levels of controlled staking, such as <b>50% and 66%</b>, increase the potential for more severe disruptions, including sustained chain splits and transaction censorship or reversal. The foundation&#8217;s article elaborates, &#8220;At &gt;50% of the total stake the attacker could dominate the fork choice algorithm&#8230; enabling the attacker to censor certain transactions, do short-range reorgs and extract maximum MEV by reordering blocks in their favor.&#8221;</p>

<p>The defense against these threats includes the &#8220;inactivity leak,&#8221; a mechanism that gradually reduces the staked ether of non-participating or malicious validators, and the social layer of consensus among the Ethereum community on which chain to continue should a split occur.</p>
<p>These revelations underscore the importance of community awareness and technical safeguards in maintaining the security and integrity of the Ethereum network. They highlight that while Ethereum&#8217;s PoS system offers several security advantages, it also requires vigilant monitoring and readiness to act against potential attacks.</p>
3 Trends In ETH Staking
<p>As the Ethereum staking landscape evolves, several key trends have emerged this, reshaping how stakeholders interact with and benefit from the staking process.</p>
<p>Tom Wan, researcher at 21.co, <a href="https://twitter.com/tomwanhh/status/1778053635857150020" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">highlighted</a> these in a recent post on X:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Increase in Re-staking Popularity</b>: Since 2024, there has been a significant shift towards re-staking in the Ethereum ecosystem. Re-staking contributions have grown from 10% to 60% of the total staked ETH. <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/andreessen-horowitz-fuel-crypto-startup-100-million/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Eigenlayer</a>, in particular, has risen to prominence as the second-largest DeFi protocol on Ethereum, holding a $15 billion Total Value Locked (TVL), which represents 13% of all staked ETH.</li>
<li><b>Decline in Lido&#8217;s Market Share</b>: The rise of liquid restaking protocols has noticeably impacted Lido’s dominance in the Ethereum staking market. <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-foundation-insider-lido-system-threat/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Lido&#8217;s share</a> has fallen below 30%, influenced by the growth of new platforms like Etherfi, which has become the second-largest withdrawer of stETH since 2024, totaling withdrawals of 108k stETH.</li>
<li><strong>Centralized Exchange (CEX) Staking Decline:</strong> The dominance of centralized exchanges in ETH staking has seen a downturn, decreasing from 29.7% to 25.8% since 2024. Kiln Finance recently surpassed Binance to become the third-largest ETH staking entity. Ether.fi is also gaining ground and is positioned to further challenge Binance&#8217;s former dominance in the near future.</li>
</ol>
<p>At press time, ETH traded at $3,526.</p>

<title>Satoshi Smackdown: Fake Bitcoin Inventor Drops Lawsuit Against Critic</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章讲述了比特币创造者身份争议的最新发展。克雷格·赖特对知名比特币爱好者Hodlonaut提起的诽谤诉讼告终，挑战克雷格·赖特身份为中本聪的说法。挪威法庭裁定支持Hodlonaut，拒绝了克雷格·赖特对比特币白皮书所有权的主张。这一结果强化了对克雷格·赖特声称的怀疑，并提醒了比特币社区对他的怀疑。 <div>
<p>In a dramatic conclusion to a five-year legal saga, Craig Wright, the controversial figure who claims to be the elusive creator of Bitcoin, has <a href="https://www.tftc.io/craig-wright-drops-appeal-against-hodlonaut/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">dropped his lawsuit</a> against a prominent Bitcoin enthusiast known as Hodlonaut.</p>
<p>The culmination of this lengthy dispute marks a significant victory for Hodlonaut and casts further doubt on Wright&#8217;s assertions regarding his identity as Satoshi Nakamoto.</p>

<p>The origins of this legal feud trace back to May 2019 when Wright filed a lawsuit against Hodlonaut over critical social media posts.</p>
<p>Hodlonaut, a Norwegian Bitcoiner, had publicly accused Wright of being a &#8220;scammer&#8221; and a &#8220;fraud&#8221; for his claims of creating<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> Bitcoin</a>. This sparked a contentious legal battle that spanned multiple years and jurisdictions.</p>
<h2><strong>Courtroom Showdown: Hodlonaut Emerges Victorious In Defamation Dispute</strong></h2>
<p>After a trial in Oslo in 2022, a Norwegian judge ruled in favor of Hodlonaut, concluding that there were substantial grounds to believe Wright had deceived in his attempts to prove his identity as Satoshi Nakamoto.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Just got off the phone with my Norwegian lawyer.</p>
<p>CRAIG WRIGHT DROPPED THE APPEAL IN NORWAY!</p>
<p>My win from 2022 is now final and enforceable.</p>
<p>This case started May 19th, 2019 and lasted until today.</p>
<p>I’m very happy!</p>
<p>Now I just need to get the UK case dismissed/won and I can…</p>
<p>— hodlonaut 80 IQ 10%er <img alt="🌮" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f32e.png" style="height: 1em;" /><img alt="⚡" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/26a1.png" style="height: 1em;" /><img alt="🔑" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f511.png" style="height: 1em;" /> <img alt="🐝" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f41d.png" style="height: 1em;" /> (@hodlonaut) <a href="https://twitter.com/hodlonaut/status/1778457284806353177?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">April 11, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>This decision provided Hodlonaut with a crucial legal victory and served as a preemptive measure against potential defamation proceedings that Wright might initiate in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Despite Wright&#8217;s appeal of the court&#8217;s ruling, nearly five years later, he has finally relented, dropping his pursuit of legal action against Hodlonaut.</p>
<p>This development underscores the resilience of Hodlonaut and the skepticism surrounding Wright&#8217;s claims within the Bitcoin community.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/AnBbP0Om/" width="2475" /></p>

<h2><strong>COPA Triumph: Wright&#8217;s Whitepaper Ownership Claim Rejected</strong></h2>
<p>In a parallel legal battle, Craig Wright faced another setback as the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA) challenged his claim of ownership over the Bitcoin whitepaper.</p>
<p>After rigorous scrutiny, a court ruled against Wright, decisively rejecting his assertion that he authored the foundational document of Bitcoin. This ruling dealt a significant blow to Wright&#8217;s credibility and further undermined his position as Satoshi Nakamoto.</p>

Wright&#8217;s Bitcoin Saga: Norwegian Lawsuit Ends, But Scrutiny Remains
<p>The resolution of these legal disputes comes amid ongoing speculation and skepticism surrounding Wright&#8217;s claims within the cryptocurrency community. While the conclusion of the lawsuit in Norway represents a victory for Hodlonaut, there remains a pending defamation case against him in the UK.</p>
<p>Despite this looming legal challenge, the outcome of the Norwegian case underscores the difficulty Wright faces in substantiating his claims and the growing scrutiny surrounding his alleged role in the creation of Bitcoin.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。最近的SEC文件披露显示，多家华尔街公司和美国银行开始购买比特币ETF。这反映了机构对比特币的日益增长的兴趣，可能对加密货币的接受和估值产生重大影响。投资管理人和家族办公室购买了价值约400万美元的比特币ETF，显示了广泛的机构接受度。预计将在5月15日发布的Q1文件进一步揭示这一不断发展的趋势，华尔街似乎越来越愿意将比特币纳入其投资组合。BTC目前交易价格为70,706美元。 <div>
<p>Recent SEC filings under the Form 13F have disclosed that several major Wall Street firms and US banks have started purchasing Bitcoin ETFs. These revelations underscore a growing institutional interest in Bitcoin, which could have considerable implications for the cryptocurrency&#8217;s acceptance and valuation.</p>
<p>Julian Fahrer, the CEO of the Bitcoin-centric app Apollo Sats, <a href="https://twitter.com/Julian__Fahrer/status/1778210011010994424" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">highlighted</a> the importance of these disclosures, stating on social media platform X, &#8220;BREAKING: 13F SEC Filings show US Banks are buying Bitcoin.&#8221;</p>
<h2>US Banks And Wall Street Buy Bitcoin ETFs</h2>
<p>Fahrer noted that these filings include purchases from a range of investment managers and family offices with assets under management from $200 million to $10 billion, signaling a broadening base of institutional acceptance. Particularly, he pointed out American National Bank&#8217;s investment in Ark&#8217;s ETF, describing it as &#8220;significant for breaking the seal on banks buying ETFs.&#8221;</p>

<p>The second biggest name in the list is Park Avenue Securities LLC with an AUM of $9.9B which bought 7,328 GBTC shares worth $ 457,780. In total, Wall Street firms with a combined $15 billion in AUM bought exposure to Bitcoin ETFs worth approximately $4 million in Q1. The detailed breakdown of these investments is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>LexAurum Advisors, LLC</b> purchased 11,973 shares of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-private-bitcoin-event/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">BlackRock</a>’s IBIT ETF, totaling $484,547.</li>

<p>Matt Hougan, Chief Investment Officer at Bitwise, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/big-bitcoin-reveal-circle-may-15/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">explained</a> the significance of these disclosures via X, stating, “For everyone wondering &#8216;who is buying&#8217; bitcoin ETFs, I&#8217;d circle May 15th on your calendar.&#8221; He elaborated that investors managing over $100 million are mandated to file 13-F forms with the SEC, providing a periodic transparency into their public equity holdings. Although these filings only offer a snapshot, Hougan suggested that “some of the names on those filings will surprise people (to the upside).&#8221;</p>

<p>MacroScope, a renowned crypto analyst, also weighed in, <a href="https://twitter.com/MacroScope17/status/1767920902740541591" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">indicating</a> that the most interesting names might only appear in May filings, as some funds delay their disclosures to maintain strategic secrecy as long as possible. “These filings start in April and run into May. (&#8230;) In my experience, the most interesting names could come in May, since some funds wait as long as possible in order to not show their hand before required to do by the deadline,” MacroScope noted.</p>
<p>This recent trend of significant and diverse institutions steadily increasing their stakes in Bitcoin through ETFs underscores a turning point in institutional sentiment. These investments reflect a solidifying trust in its long-term value as an asset class. The forthcoming filings for Q1, expected by May 15, are anticipated to provide further insight into this evolving trend, as Wall Street appears increasingly comfortable with <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-at-a-discount-whales/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">integrating Bitcoin</a> into its portfolio.</p>
<p>At press time, BTC traded at $70,706.</p>

<title>SEC Vs. Uniswap: Legal Expert Draws Parallels To Ripple’s SEC Showdown</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/sec-vs-uniswap-expert-draws-parallels-to-ripples-sec-showdown/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/sec-vs-uniswap-expert-draws-parallels-to-ripples-sec-showdown/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。Uniswap，作为去中心化交易所，受到美国证券交易委员会（SEC）的调查。SEC发出了对Uniswap的通知，导致其代币UNI价值下跌。社区对SEC的行动表示担忧，认为其可能限制创新和去中心化。行业人士担心SEC的行动可能影响DeFi的发展，Uniswap准备对抗SEC，此举将影响未来的去中心化金融发展。 <div>
<p>Uniswap, the pioneering decentralized exchange (DEX), finds itself at the center of a legal maelstrom as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sets its sights on the platform.</p>
<p>The unexpected developments echo throughout the bitcoin space, igniting a fresh discussion about governmental overreach and its possible to inhibit innovation.</p>

<p>The tempest began when Uniswap CEO, Hayden Adams, disclosed that the SEC had issued a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/uniswap-bloodbath-uni-price-crashes-16-on-sec-lawsuit-fears/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Wells Notice</a> to the exchange, signaling the agency&#8217;s intent to pursue enforcement actions.</p>
<p>This revelation sent ripples through the crypto markets, with Uniswap&#8217;s native token, UNI, witnessing a precipitous 10% decline in value within a mere 24-hour period.</p>
<h2><strong>Uniswap Under Fire: Regulatory Storm Clouds Gather</strong></h2>
<p>The SEC&#8217;s move against<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/uniswap" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> Uniswap</a> echoes its ongoing legal battle with Ripple, drawing parallels that raise questions about the regulator&#8217;s modus operandi.</p>
<p>Pro-crypto attorney Bill Morgan points out a striking similarity in the SEC&#8217;s approach, noting the agency&#8217;s penchant for biding its time before swooping in on successful crypto enterprises.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">XRP was 8 years old when the SEC sued Ripple. That is the SEC way. Wait until they are successful and then sue them for billions. <a href="https://t.co/kyRqSzPF9g" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://t.co/kyRqSzPF9g</a></p>

<p>This observation underscores a broader pattern of regulatory enforcement that has gripped the industry in uncertainty.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Wasn’t this obvious to you when Ripple was sued in 2020. Leaving aside the lawsuits against the exchanges, this is the biggest attack on a single crypto project (until today top 20 but now no.22) since Ripple was sued. <a href="https://t.co/Vx8H7vkXRl" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://t.co/Vx8H7vkXRl</a></p>

<p></p>
<p>In the face of mounting tensions, the crypto community mobilizes in solidarity with Uniswap, rallying behind the embattled exchange in a show of defiance against perceived regulatory overreach.</p>
<p>Voices from within the community express concern over the potential chilling effect of the SEC&#8217;s actions on innovation and decentralization, highlighting the need for greater regulatory clarity and dialogue.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/4TdkFr8D/" width="2475" /></p>

<h2><strong>Defiance In The Face Of Adversity</strong></h2>
<p>Matt Corva, General Counsel at ConsenSys, offers a sobering perspective on the SEC&#8217;s enforcement agenda, suggesting ulterior motives aimed at quelling the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) and preserving the status quo.</p>
<p>Adam Cochran, founder of venture capital firms Cinneamhain Ventures, also reflects on the situation, pondering why the agency decided to send the company a Wells Notice at this point.</p>

<p>As Uniswap prepares to mount its defense against the SEC&#8217;s onslaught, industry stakeholders brace for a protracted legal battle that could shape the future of decentralized finance.</p>
<p>The outcome of this confrontation will not only impact Uniswap and its users but could also set a precedent for how regulators engage with emerging technologies in the digital age.</p>

<title>Solana Lender Drama Deepens: $250 Million Outflow After Founder Quits</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。Solana区块链上的项目之间发生了纷争，导致MarginFi借贷协议的CEO辞职。SolBlaze指责MarginFi未能向用户补充奖励代币，导致社区缺乏信任。Solend也加入争端，承诺向从MarginFi转移资金的用户进行空投。Edgar Pavlovsky因在社交媒体上的不当言论辞去CEO职务，引发更多批评和用户流失。Solend协议则在事件中吸引了更多新用户。整体价值锁定（TVL）下降，MarginFi面临严重损失。 <div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Solana continues to be on <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-april-15-fix-network-congestion/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">the news</a>, this time due to some projects based on the chain having a dispute. Solana-based lending and borrowing protocol MarginFi has recently been “beefing” with Solend, another lending protocol, and SolBlaze, a liquid staking platform.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the drama, MarginFi’s CEO and founder stepped down after some “inappropriate” X posts and massive criticism. The project now faces significant outflows and a lack of trust from the Solana community.</p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Solana’s Projects Fight Each Other</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Yesterday, SolBlaze claimed that MarginFi had failed to replenish the BLZE tokens into their rewards system for users to claim for the past three weeks. Moreover, the staking platform implied that the MarginFi team refused to respond to their attempts to reach out and clarify the situation.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">MacBrennan, the co-founder of the MRGN group, considered the project “the target of a very unfortunate hit piece.” In an X post, the MarginFi contributor “clarified the misinformation.”</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">We were the target of a very unfortunate hit piece today.</p>
<p>I'll clarify the misinformation you're seeing:</p>
<p>1) This tweet is completely wrong</p>
<p>marginfi has failed to replenish BLZE over the last 3 days, not three weeks. Yes, this is because of chain congestion and prioritizing… <a href="https://t.co/c8OhZqBYza" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/c8OhZqBYza</a></p>
<p>&mdash; macbrennan (hiring) <img alt="◼" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/25fc.png" style="height: 1em;" /> (@mrgnalt) <a href="https://twitter.com/mrgnalt/status/1778137077042803103?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">April 10, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Per the post, the replenishing issues had occurred over the last eight days instead of three weeks. The problems were caused by the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-existential-moment-co-founder-speaks-out/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Solana network</a> congestion and “prioritizing user safety.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, MacBrennan refuted the claims that MarginFi’s team declined to respond. According to the post, the SolBlaze team reached out to them at 4:46 am on the same day SolBlaze posted the “exposé.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">MarginFi users were quick to respond to MacBrennan’s post, criticizing the project for not being truthful. The protocol users <a href="https://x.com/HODLonBRO/status/1778145639463067955" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">legitimized</a> SolBlaze’s claims by stating they had not received BLZE tokens long before the network congestion started.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Adding fuel to the fire, the Solend protocol team <a href="https://twitter.com/solendprotocol/status/1778188189016203752" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">posted</a> on their official X account that the project will airdrop to the users who withdraw from MarginFi and deposit into their protocol.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Rooter, Solend’s founder, explained why they joined in, <a href="https://twitter.com/0xrooter/status/1778240555623072025" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">affirming</a> that his project was “on the receiving end of multiple attacks” during the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-ico-whale-cashes-out-price-3000-bearish/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">bear </a>market.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The alleged attacks from the MarginFi team included “attempting to blackball Solend with peers,” bad-mouthing and criticizing the project, and “attacking Solend’s oracle configuration.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Rooter claimed that healthy competition is well-received, but that isn’t what occurs with MarginFi. Solend’s founder concluded: “MarginFi rubs many teams the wrong way with their misconduct.”</p>
<p><img alt="SOL, SOLUSDT, Solana, crypto" class="size-large wp-image-293788 aligncenter" height="605" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOL_2024-04-11_08-15-05.png?w=980&#038;resize=980%2C605" width="980" /></p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">MarginFi CEO Quits, Claims Differences With The Team</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Amid the drama, MarginFi’s founder and CEO, Edgar Pavlovsky, made a <a href="https://twitter.com/AlexPaz0X/status/1778428270922367313/photo/3" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">series</a> of responses to the criticism that were not well received. Pavlovsky stated in one of his responses, “Take your money out, go fuck yourself,” later calling the user an “irrelevant, slandering piece of shit.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The reply spree continued throughout Wednesday afternoon, resulting in the later resignation from his position in all MRGN arms. The former CEO claimed he doesn’t “agree with how things have been done internally or externally.”</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I resigned from mrgn today. From working on marginfi, from the research arm, from it all.</p>
<p>It's a world class team &#8212; it really is &#8212; but I don't agree with the way things have been done internally or externally. I've said it many times and I'll say it again, but those of us who…</p>
<p>&mdash; edgar <img alt="◼" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/25fc.png" style="height: 1em;" /> (@edgarpavlovsky) <a href="https://twitter.com/edgarpavlovsky/status/1778175476118302775?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">April 10, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The lending protocol confirmed Pavlovsky’s resignation, stating that “his departure is a function of internal operational disagreements and his reasons.” Additionally, they reassured users that all projects remained fully operational and unaffected by the founder’s departure.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The announcement also received criticism, with MarginFi users expressing concern about the lack of a timeline regarding the token airdrop. It appears the incident has made many <a href="https://twitter.com/jpvssss/status/1778197561746338038" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reconsider</a> continuing to use the protocol.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, the total value locked (TVL) dropped from $910 million to $660 million. According to Dune data, the massive outflows account for $250 million in the past 48 hours.</p>

<title>Uniswap Labs Counters SEC Probe And UNI’s 30% Price Drop With New Cross-Chain ERC Standard</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/uniswap-labs-new-cross-chain-erc-standard/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/uniswap-labs-new-cross-chain-erc-standard/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。<br />Uniswap Labs收到了美国证券交易委员会（SEC）的Wells通知，可能会面临执法行动。与Across合作，提出了跨链意向的新标准，以提高跨链操作效率。UniswapX计划成为新ERC标准的首个采用者，以改善用户体验。新标准将通过Ethereum应用层建立规则，允许不同的基于意向的系统之间轻松互操作。目标是降低成本，加快订单交付速度。UNI代币受到SEC通知的影响，价格出现大幅下跌。 <div>
<p>Uniswap Labs, the software development company behind the decentralized exchange (DEX) Uniswap, was <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/uniswap-labs-receives-wells-notice-from-sec/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">served</a> with a Wells Notice by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday, which could result in an Enforcement Action.</p>
<p>Amid these regulatory challenges, Uniswap Labs has partnered with Across, a cross-chain protocol, to propose a new standard for cross-chain intents. </p>
<h2>Uniswap Labs And Across Collaboration</h2>
<p>The joint proposal <a href="https://blog.uniswap.org/uniswap-labs-and-across-propose-standard-for-cross-chain-intents" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced </a>Thursday introduces a new standard for cross-chain intents that enables end-to-end interoperability between intent-based systems through a universal filler network. </p>
<p>Cross-chain intents involve transferring or interacting with assets and protocols across multiple blockchain platforms.</p>

<p>To initiate the process of creating an <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/uniswap-hits-2-trillion-trading-volume/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ethereum Request for Comment</a> (ERC) around this standard, Uniswap Labs and Across plan to present the standard to the CAKE Working Group for further discussion and review.</p>
<p>Furthermore, UniswapX, the upcoming project by Uniswap Labs focusing on cross-chain functionality, will be the first adopter of the new ERC. By integrating support for cross-chain functionality, UniswapX aims to improve the user experience and expand the scope of its services. </p>
<h2>Intent-Based Systems</h2>
<p>The Uniswap Labs team stated that cross-chain protocols have traditionally adopted various approaches to connect activities between <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/uni-soars-uniswap-users-base-optimism-double/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">blockchain networks</a>. While messaging-based designs have been popular, they &#8220;suffer from slow transfer finalization and high costs.&#8221; </p>
<p>Intents-based approaches offer a &#8220;more efficient&#8221; solution for the software development company. Uniswap Labs further asserts that by allowing users to specify the desired end-state of the chain, intents-based systems enable a network of fillers to compete and fulfill the user&#8217;s outcome quickly and cost-effectively. </p>
<p>However, until now, each intent-based system has operated through its network, resulting in delays and alleged “centralization risks,” according to the company. </p>
<p>The announcement also notes that the proposed standard establishes rules at Ethereum&#8217;s application layer, allowing independent intent-based systems to “interoperate easily.” </p>
Lower Costs And Faster Order Delivery? 
<p>The &#8216;CrossChainOrder&#8217; and &#8216;CrossChainSettler&#8217; components are central to the proposed standard. The &#8216;CrossChainOrder&#8217; struct defines key parameters of the user&#8217;s order, including the deadline for order fulfillment or delivery, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/jupiter-uniswap-solana-ethereum/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">settlement contract</a> that holds user funds, and implementation-specific data. </p>
<p>The &#8216;CrossChainSettler&#8217; interface specifies the functions settlement contracts must implement to resolve and initiate implementation-specific orders on-chain.</p>
<p>By adhering to this ERC standard, users can reportedly sign cross-chain orders that conform to a unified specification. Whether interacting with UniswapX, Across, or other systems, the company claims that users follow the same standard, enabling <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dictators-beware-bitcoin-might-be-your-downfall/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">cross-chain applications</a> to share filler sets through a universal network. </p>
<p>This approach is said to eliminate siloed networks and reduce reliance on a few fillers, thereby improving decentralization and reducing the risks associated with centralized fillers.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the company believes establishing a unified standard for intent-based systems will significantly improve the user experience for applications, fillers, and end users. The Uniswap Labs team concluded by stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>Fillers have a lower entry barrier, and lower costs, and they can capture more order flow instead of specializing for a single application. Applications can route their users’ intents through a wider, more competitive network. And users get faster fills and lower costs because the fillers operate with greater capital efficiency.</p></blockquote>

<p>The receipt of the SEC&#8217;s Wells Notice by Uniswap Labs has significantly impacted the UNI token, leading to a notable downtrend in its price. Over the past 24 hours alone, the token has experienced a price drop of more than 21%.</p>
<p>This downward trend has extended to nearly 35% over the past month, resulting in the current trading price of $8.820.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Hashrate Returns Near ATH, Forces BTC Difficulty To Grow 4%</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-hashrate-ath-forces-btc-difficulty-grow-4/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-hashrate-ath-forces-btc-difficulty-grow-4/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />近期比特币挖矿难度上升4%，与挖矿算力接近历史最高水平有关。挖矿算力可以体现网络安全和矿工对挖矿加密货币的需求。算力增加意味着更大的网络安全，但也意味着矿工竞争加剧。BTC价格目前为69,700美元，比过去一周上涨了3%。 Bitcoin挖矿难度也随着算力增加在最新的两周调整中提高。 <div>
<p>On-chain data shows the Bitcoin mining difficulty has risen by 4% recently as the mining hashrate has approached all-time high (ATH) levels.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin 7-Day Mining Hashrate Is Back Near ATH Levels</h2>
<p>The &#8220;<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-hashrate-plunges-from-all-time-high-but-why/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">mining hashrate</a>&#8221; refers to the total computing power that the miners have connected to the Bitcoin blockchain. This metric correlates with the network&#8217;s security.</p>
<p>To perform a successful 51% attack on the network, bad actors must gain control over at least 51% of the online mining rigs. When the hashrate goes up, the security naturally strengthens, as there are now more machines that an attacker needs to succeed.</p>

<p>Of course, this is only true if the new power being added to the network is properly decentralized. If the hashrate is centralized, the network risk may not decrease by the same degree if more power is added.</p>
<p>The hashrate also provides a look into the demand for mining cryptocurrency. Growth suggests that miners find the network attractive, while a decline implies that some miners find the chain unprofitable and have thus decided to disconnect.</p>
<p>Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 7-day average Bitcoin mining hashrate over the past year:</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Mining Hashrate" class="alignnone wp-image-293760 size-large aligncenter" height="423" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/chart.png?resize=980%2C423" width="980" /></p>

<p>As displayed in the above graph, the 7-day average Bitcoin mining hashrate has registered an increase recently and has approached its ATH value setback in mid-March. The miners have decided to re-expand their facilities after dialing back earlier.</p>
<p>Besides measuring the total computing power, the hashrate can also be viewed as a representation of the competition between the individual miners.</p>
<p>On the Bitcoin network, block rewards that the miners receive are fixed in BTC value (except for during <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/by-numbers-how-bitcoin-mining-costs-post-halving/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Halving</a> events, when they are permanently slashed in half). The chain also aims to distribute them at a more or less steady rate, with a block added about every 10 minutes.</p>
<p>This means that even if the miners add more hashrate, they can&#8217;t use the extra power to process blocks faster. Thus, since the rewards stay the same, an increase in the hashrate means the share of every individual miner gets smaller.</p>
<p>A miner can only prevent this from happening if they also increase their hashrate by the same proportion as the network increase. Either way, an increase in the hashrate is bad news for the margins of the individual miners, as it means that competition has just become tougher.</p>
<p>To ensure this dynamic remains true, the Bitcoin network has the &#8220;<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-difficulty-drops-miners-expand-halving/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">difficulty</a>&#8221; feature implemented. When the miners add more computing power, the block time initially shrinks as they leverage the extra hashrate to pump out blocks faster.</p>

<p>As a response, however, the network increases the difficulty, making it harder for the miners to solve blocks. Thus, any speed increase counteracts the extra computing power offered.</p>
<p>Following the latest hashrate increase, it&#8217;s not unexpected that the difficulty has also increased in the latest biweekly adjustment on the chain.</p>

<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $69,700, up 3% over the past week.</p>

<title>Dapper Labs Rocked By SEC’s Explosive Investigation In 2023: Revelations Exposed</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/secs-investigation-of-dapper-labs-uncovered/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/secs-investigation-of-dapper-labs-uncovered/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的<br />一份最近的《财富》杂志报道揭示，知名非同质化代币（NFT）公司Dapper Labs曾受到证交会（SEC）的调查，直到2023年9月。SEC的加密和网络单位负责人David Hirsch突然终止了对Dapper Labs的调查，但关闭的原因未公开。尽管这可能给NFT市场参与者提供一些安慰，但证券律师警告不是所有NFT都可以视为安全，因为SEC已经表示某些NFT交易可能被视为未注册证券。 <div>
<p>A recent Fortune Magazine report revealed that Dapper Labs, a prominent non-fungible token (NFT) company, was under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) until September 2023. </p>
<p>The internal agency document obtained by Fortune indicates that the investigation was abruptly closed, leaving many questions unanswered.</p>
<h2>Dapper Labs Investigation Terminated By SEC Chief</h2>
<p>Per the <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/04/11/sec-dapper-labs-investigation-case-closed-september-2023-roham-gharegozlou/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, the SEC&#8217;s crypto and cyber unit chief, David Hirsch, terminated the &#8220;Dapper Labs, Inc.&#8221; investigation on September 29. However, the report does not disclose the reasons for the investigation, the duration, or the factors leading to its closure. </p>
<p>Notably, the SEC did not provide the five-page recommendations associated with the report, and a spokesperson declined to comment on the investigation&#8217;s existence.</p>

<p>The SEC&#8217;s decision to close the Dapper Labs investigation follows settlements with Impact Theory and Stoner Cats, marking the SEC&#8217;s initial actions against the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-ethereum-shiba-inu/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">NFT industry</a>. </p>
<p>The agency argued that both projects offered and sold &#8220;unregistered securities&#8221; in alleged violation of federal law. Notably, Dapper Labs also faces an ongoing class action lawsuit in which plaintiffs allege that NBA Top Shot Moments, NFTs sold by Dapper Labs, are unregistered securities.</p>
<h2>Caution Still Necessary?</h2>
<p>The SEC&#8217;s closure of the investigation into Dapper Labs, one of the industry&#8217;s well-funded companies, may provide some reassurance to participants in the NFT market. </p>
<p>However, securities lawyers caution that not all NFTs can be presumed safe, as the SEC has already indicated that certain transactions in NFTs could be considered <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/spot-ethereum-etfs-unlikely-get-sec-approval/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">securities transactions</a>.</p>
<p>Legal experts such as Philip Moustakis, a securities attorney with Seward &amp; Kissel, caution that the SEC&#8217;s closing of the investigation does not necessarily absolve Dapper Labs of any wrongdoing or guarantee an end to securities-related litigation. </p>
<p>Interestingly, the ongoing class action lawsuit against Dapper Labs alleging unregistered securities in NBA Top Shot Moments continues to move through federal court.</p>
SEC&#8217;s Ongoing Crackdown
<p>Dapper Labs gained attention in 2017 with the launch of CryptoKitties, a blockchain-based game that allowed players to create and trade <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/disney-ventures-into-nft-collaborates-with-dapper/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">NFTs of cartoon cats</a>. The success of CryptoKitties led to significant investments from renowned firms. </p>
<p>Dapper Labs further expanded its presence with Top Shot, an NBA-endorsed marketplace for NFT-based video highlights. However, the NFT market experienced a substantial decline in 2022, leading to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dapper-labs-lays-off-51-in-its-third-round-of-cuts/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">layoffs </a>at Dapper Labs.</p>

<p>It is important to highlight that although the case above has been closed, recent developments indicate that the SEC’s enforcement actions and crackdown on the cryptocurrency industry show no signs of abating. </p>
<p>Bitcoinist <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/uniswap-labs-receives-wells-notice-from-sec/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">reported </a>on Wednesday that the regulatory body issued a Wells Notice to Uniswap Labs, the software development company behind the decentralized exchange (DEX) Uniswap.</p>
<p>A Wells Notice serves as formal communication to the company, indicating that the SEC staff has concluded their investigation and is considering recommending enforcement action against them in response to their findings.</p>

<title>Dogecoin Whales Are Selling: How The Growing Bearish Sentiment Can Affect DOGE’s Price</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-whales-doge-price/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-whales-doge-price/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。狗狗币的价格目前受到大户们开始出售的影响，同时短期持有者的持有量增加，使他们更容易受到抛售的影响。大户们正在减少他们的持有量，这导致了狗狗币价格的下跌。同时，狗狗币正面临突破0.20美元的阻力，大量持有者的亏损可能导致更多抛售。 <div>
<p>Dogecoin investors have recently seen the crypto <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/dogecoin-2/dogecoin-slows-down-doge-new-highs/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">stalling at the $0.2 mark</a> as bullish sentiment amongst whales and other traders starts to falter. Interestingly, DOGE has yet to have a tangible breakout above the $0.2 mark since March 31. In fact, the crypto went on a decline in the first week of April to reach as low as $0.1719. </p>
<p>Despite <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/dogecoin-2/dogecoin-rally-intensifies-eyes-set-on-historic-new-highs/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">having reversed</a> some of this decline at the time of writing, Dogecoin has yet to perform as many investors would expect. Furthermore, chart formation shows the cryptocurrency could be stuck in a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-shiba-inu-price-red/">bearish pattern</a> and on-chain data indicates whales are selling their DOGE holdings. At the same time, short-term holders have seen their holdings increase, which makes them vulnerable to selloffs.</p>
<h2>Dogecoin Whales Are Selling</h2>
<p>According to data from the on-chain analytics platform Santiment, the amount of Dogecoin in wallets holding between 10,000,000 and 100,000,000 DOGE has been in a freefall since the beginning of the month. The wallets have particularly decreased their holdings by 333 million DOGE in this timeframe. </p>

<p>Whales often drive price action and sentiment in the crypto market, as evidenced by an accompanying fall in the price of Dogecoin. For example, the drop in the total whale balance has corresponded with an 18% drop in DOGE&#8217;s price from $0.2262 on March 28 to $0.1854 in the past 24 hours. </p>
<img alt="Dogecoin" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-293704 aligncenter" height="173" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Shiba-Inu.png?w=512&#038;resize=512%2C173" width="512" />Source: Santiment


<p>Recent data from <a href="https://app.intotheblock.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">IntoTheBlock </a>also shows a 6% increase in the holdings of short-term traders in the past 10 days. While this could signal a bullish trend among DOGE short-term holders, their trading nature spells a potential decline for the crypto. Unlike whales and long-term holders, short-term traders are known for holding their assets for only between one to three months, making their holdings vulnerable to selloffs any time soon which could lead to a drop in price.</p>
<h2>What’s Next For DOGE?</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, DOGE is trading at $0.1970, up by 4% in the past 24 hours. However, the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/bitcoin-dogecoin-xrp-months/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">bullish sentiment</a> would <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/dogecoin-2/dogecoin-slows-down-doge-new-highs/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">need to flow</a> to a majority of the whales for the crypto to keep up the bullish action. Increased selloff from large traders could change the sentiment of other investors, leading to a fall in the price of DOGE.  </p>

<p>IntoTheBlock <a href="https://x.com/intotheblock/status/1777722911031275769" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">recently noted</a> that Dogecoin is facing a big resistance at $0.20 on its way to breaking a new yearly high. Notably, over 32,000 addresses are holding 3.78 billion DOGE at a loss at this price level. This means a break over this level could see a large bunch selling their holdings, which in turn could <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-stalls-at-0-2-doge/">derail a price increase</a>.  </p>

<title>Do Kwon’s Extradition To The US Edges Towards Final Decision With Montenegro’s High Court Ruling</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/do-kwons-extradition-us-towards-final-decision/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/do-kwons-extradition-us-towards-final-decision/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。黑山高等法院再次批准了Do Kwon的引渡，为他可能被引渡到美国铺平了道路。之前，当地最高法院曾批准将Do Kwon引渡到韩国，导致引渡程序再次开始。现在，黑山Podgorica高等法院裁定支持将Kwon引渡，但最终决定权在司法部长Andrej Milovic手中。由于司法部长表示希望Kwon在美国接受法律诉讼，因此有人认为Kwon被引渡到美国的可能性增加。 Kwon之前在加密货币Terra Luna崩溃之前消失，之后在蒙特内哥罗出现，已被捕并在监狱中服刑。 关于Do Kwon的命运仍然不确定，决定权在黑山司法部长Andrej Milovic手中。当前，原始Terra区块链的本地代币Luna Classic（LUNC）价格下跌，但在过去24小时中有所回升。 <div>
<p>Montenegro&#8217;s High Court has once again approved the extradition of Do Kwon, a key figure in the cryptocurrency Terra Luna crash, paving the way for a potential transfer to the United States. </p>
<p>The decision came after the local Supreme Court <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/do-kwon-latest-ruling-reverses-extradition/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">overturned </a>the previous decision to extradite Do Kwon to South Korea, requiring the extradition process to begin again.</p>
<h2>Montenegro Court Clears Path For Do Kwon&#8217;s Extradition</h2>
<p>According to South Korean media <a href="https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20240411157700109" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reports</a>, the likelihood of Do Kwon&#8217;s repatriation to the United States has increased due to the stance of the Attorney General, who has the final decision-making power. </p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Podgorica High Court in Montenegro ruled in favor of Kwon&#8217;s extradition, saying that the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/do-kwon-extradition-us-fights-on/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">legal requirements</a> for extradition to both South Korea and the United States had been met. </p>
<p>However, Marija Rakovic, head of public relations at the Podgorica High Court, confirmed that Justice Minister Andrej Milovic would make the final decision regarding the extradition case.</p>

<p>The previous <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/terra-do-kwon-wins-appeal/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">extradition decision</a> by the Podgorica High Court, which took place in November last year, was invalidated due to the Supreme Court&#8217;s ruling. </p>
<p>Following a request from the Supreme Prosecutor&#8217;s Office to determine its legality, the Supreme Court overturned the decision because it exceeded the court&#8217;s authority. </p>
<p>The Supreme Court clarified that the court&#8217;s role is to assess whether the legal requirements for extradition are met, while the decision to approve or prioritize extradition lies with the competent minister.</p>
<p>Consequently, the Podgorica High Court had to repeat the extradition review process, ultimately permitting Do Kwon&#8217;s extradition and leaving the final decision in the hands of Justice Minister Andrej Milovic.</p>
<h2>Is Kwon&#8217;s Extradition To The US More Likely?</h2>
<p>Despite the ongoing appeal process, speculation has arisen regarding the increased likelihood of Do Kwon&#8217;s extradition to the United States, primarily due to Minister Milovic&#8217;s expressed desire for Kwon to face legal proceedings in the US. </p>
<p>Per the report, the defense team representing Do Kwon has a three-day window to appeal the decision once they receive the translated judgment from the Podgorica High Court.</p>
<p>Minister Milovic, in a local <a href="https://balkaninsight.com/2023/11/24/montenegro-ready-to-extradite-south-korean-crypto-fugitive/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">interview</a> posted in November last year, emphasized the United States as Montenegro&#8217;s most important foreign policy partner, which may shed light on his position concerning Kwon&#8217;s extradition.</p>
<p>Do Kwon, the co-founder of Terraform Labs, disappeared shortly before the cryptocurrency <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/do-kwon-extradition-takes-priority-in-40b-case/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Terra Luna crash</a> in April 2022 and later surfaced in Montenegro after a journey through the United Arab Emirates and Serbia. </p>

<p>Kwon was apprehended at a local airport on March 23 last year upon discovering a fake passport. Kwon served a four-month prison sentence for using the counterfeit document and was subsequently transferred to a foreign detention center upon his release on the 23rd of last month.</p>
<p>As the legal proceedings unfold, Do Kwon&#8217;s fate remains uncertain. The potential outcome is significantly impacted by the decision of Montenegro&#8217;s Minister of Justice, Andrej Milovic.</p>
<img alt="Do Kwon " class="size-medium" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/RrJYKeEp/" width="1814" />
<p>At present, Luna Classic (LUNC), the native token of the original Terra blockchain, is trading at $0.0001285, reflecting a 31% decrease in price over the past 30 days. However, LUNC has experienced a slight surge of 1.2% in the past 24 hours.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/total-shiba-inu-addresses-touches-new-high/">total number of addresses on Shiba Inu</a> has now exceeded four million, according to <a href="https://app.intotheblock.com/register" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">data</a> from IntoTheBlock. This achievement underscores the resilience and continued growth of the doggy-themed meme coin in the competitive market. </p>

<p>Despite <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-shiba-inu-price-red/">witnessing periods of high volatility and declines</a>, the Shiba Inu network has continued to expand vigorously, underscoring the immense support and strength of its community. More importantly, Shiba Inu’s new milestone emphasizes an increase in its already extensive user base, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-adoption-crypto-atm/">fostering adoption</a> and aiding the network’s growth and development. </p>
<p>Earlier in March, the cryptocurrency <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-active-addresses-soar-over-170/">recorded another milestone</a>, surging by a whopping 170% in its daily active addresses, while the cryptocurrency’s daily trading volume exceeded $16 million. Notably, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shib-grayscale-shiba-inu-etf/">Shiba Inu community</a> has been a key factor in driving the ecosystem’s growth and cryptocurrency’s adoption rate. </p>
<h2>SHIB Price Struggles Below $0.00003</h2>
<p>At the beginning of the year, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-shib-price-recover/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">the price of SHIB</a>, the native token of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, had witnessed <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/shiba-inu-mania-price-surges-60-as-burn-rate-heats-up-by-over-22000/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">double-digit gains</a> that pushed its price upwards above $0.00003. However, recently, the cryptocurrency has been on a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/why-is-shiba-inu-price-down-today/">decline trend</a>, rising one moment before retracing and experiencing a price correction. </p>
<p>Around February and March, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-surge-in-interest/">demand and interest for the doggy-themed meme coin</a> surged to unprecedented highs, driving its market value and contributing significantly to its price increases. At the time, SHIB had been among the most popular cryptocurrencies, even <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-climbs-to-second-spot-in-crypto-searches-as-shib-rallies/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">hitting new records in Europe</a> by emerging as the second most searched cryptocurrency on the continent.   </p>

<p>Currently, the value of SHIB is trading below market expectations at a price of $0.0000279, at the time of writing. The cryptocurrency displayed a slight uptick in the past week, increasing by about 4.7%. However, in the past month, Shiba Inu has been showing red candles, trading in the red zone for weeks and declining by 14.46%, according to CoinMarketCap. </p>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-burn-rate-down-28/">These price fluctuations</a> have placed Shiba Inu’s market value in an uncertain position, as more declines could lead to anxiety and uncertainty from investors. Despite the recent bearish performance, SHIB’s price has stayed resilient, striving to keep its value above $0.000027 as the market volatility continues. </p>
<p>For many investors, this decline will be seen as a buying and HODLing opportunity, as they <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-turns-bullish-crypto/">anticipate a potential rebound</a> in the cryptocurrency’s value to yield profits. </p>

<title>Bitcoin NFTs Roaring: This Collection Flipped BAYC, Is CryptoPunks Next?</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-nfts-collection-bayc-cryptopunks/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-nfts-collection-bayc-cryptopunks/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章提到了比特币价格受挡住空头压力的影响，但同时也指出了NFT领域的另一次历史性转变。据一位分析师称，基于比特币发行的NFT收藏品Runestone近期备受关注。该收藏品的价值已经接近翻转以太坊最有价值的收藏品之一，CryptoPunks。文章指出这一“橙色浪潮”标志着NFT领域的潜在转变，可能会巩固比特币的地位。文章还讨论了Runestone的成功，并提到即将推出的Runes标准可能会成为一个游戏改变者。最后，文章强调了NFT收藏品价值的下降以及使用以太坊高昂发行成本的问题。 <div>
<p>While Bitcoin prices reject bear pressure, another historic shift is happening in the non-fungible tokens (NFTs) world. According to one analyst on X, Runestone, an NFT collection minted on Bitcoin, has recently gained popularity.</p>
<h2>The Rise And Rise Of Runestone: A Bitcoin NFT Collection</h2>
<p>The observer now <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/LeonidasNFT/status/1778252036456190136" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">notes</a> that its value is halfway from flipping one of the most valuable collections on Ethereum, the CryptoPunks. This emerging trend, the &#8220;orange wave,&#8221; signifies a potential shift in the NFT landscape that will likely cement Bitcoin&#8217;s position.</p>
<img alt="Bitcoin NFT collection rising | Analyst on X" class="size-full wp-image-293712" height="598" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GK2emNOWsAA169O.jpg?resize=1024%2C598" width="1024" />
<p>Bitcoin is the most valuable coin by market cap, ahead of Ethereum. However, despite its mega valuation, the coin has lagged in other spheres because of its inherent lack of capability for smart contracts. </p>
<p>This is where Ethereum shines, as seen in the multiple innovations launched over the years, such as decentralized finance (DeFi), gaming, NFTs, and more.</p>

<p>The success of DeFi protocols like Uniswap or Maker, for instance, and the wild popularity of NFT collections like CryptoPunks and Bored Ape Yacht Club (<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/floor-prices-nft-rising-analyst-skeptical/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">BAYC</a>), among others, are testaments to Bitcoin&#8217;s role in the sphere. However, this is about to change as innovators look to tap into Bitcoin&#8217;s security and broad base to launch DeFi protocols and even NFT collections.</p>
<p>According to the analyst, Runestone currently commands a total value locked (TVL) of over $731 million, roughly double that of BAYC. It is half that of CryptoPunks, but given its fast-rising popularity, it could narrow the gap with the most valuable collection in Ethereum. </p>
<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/x/Ffpgf4bn/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Bitcoin price trending upward on the daily chart | Source: BTCUSDT on Binance, TradingView" class="size-full" height="904" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/Ffpgf4bn/" width="1787" /></a>
<p>Runestone is an open-source protocol. The collection was minted to reward participants who participated in the first year of the Ordinals protocol. </p>
<p>So far, CoinGecko data <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/nft/runestone" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">shows</a> that 112,400 NFTs have been minted and distributed to 76,972 addresses. Runestone NFTs have a floor price of around $6,500 at spot rates. However, as demand increases, prices will likely increase even further, pushing the total TVL to $1 billion.</p>
<h2>Runes Incoming: Will It Be A Game Changer?</h2>
<p>Given the success of Runestone NFTs, it is likely that more collections will be launched on Bitcoin following the anticipated launch of Runes in the next few days. </p>
<p>Runes, a new standard, will aim to improve the current BRC-20 standard by allowing the issuance of fungible tokens on Bitcoin. This development could open up more opportunities for developers to launch new solutions, leveraging Bitcoin&#8217;s superior security.</p>

<p>Since the surge of crypto assets in 2021, the value of NFT collections has been depressed over the last two years. BAYC, CryptoPunks, and other high-value collections on NFTs slumped by over 50%, which was made worse by the relatively high cost of minting on Ethereum. </p>

<p>Additionally, the rise of meme coins shifted attention from NFT trading as traders scrambled to catch the next big meme coin wave launching on Solana, Ethereum, Avalanche, and even Ethereum layer-2 protocols.  </p>

<title>Bitfinex Securities Reveals $6.25 Million Tokenized Debt Plan For El Salvador Hotel Development – Details</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。Bitfinex Securities打算发行代币化债务以筹集625万美元，用于建设位于萨尔瓦多国际机场的汉普顿希尔顿酒店综合体。代币将在Liquid Network上发行，投资者可用美元和Tether的USDT稳定币进行交易。此举将在当地创造经济增长和就业机会。同时，萨尔瓦多继续将自己打造为数字货币枢纽，教育部已将加密货币教育纳入学校课程。 <div>
<p>Bitfinex Securities earlier today <a href="https://blog.bitfinex.com/media-releases/bitfinex-securities-announces-capital-raise-for-hampton-by-hilton-at-el-salvador-international-airport/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">unveiled</a> plans to launch a tokenized debt issue to fund the construction of a &#8220;Hampton by Hilton hotel complex at El Salvador International Airport.&#8221; The issuance seeks to raise a substantial $6.25 million to facilitate the development of this 4,484-square-meter project.</p>
<h2>Bitfinex Ventures Into El Salvador&#8217;s Tourism Sector</h2>
<p>Bitfinex Securities El Salvador S.A. de C.V., a prominent player in the tokenized securities space, spearheads the tokenized debt issue for the Hampton by Hilton project.</p>
<p>Leveraging blockchain technology and being an integral part of the Bitfinex ecosystem, Bitfinex Securities enables companies to raise capital by directly listing tokenized versions of their shares, bonds, and other financial instruments.</p>
<p>Notably, the issuance of tokenized debt for the El Salvador airport hotel complex represents a landmark moment in the country&#8217;s<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/el-salvador-moves-over-5000-bitcoin-to-vault/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> digital asset ecosystem</a>.</p>
<p>Having secured the<a href="https://blog.bitfinex.com/media-releases/bitfinex-securities-el-salvador-granted-el-salvadors-first-ever-digital-assets-license/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> first regulated license to operate in El Salvador</a> under the country&#8217;s Digital Asset Securities Law earlier this year, Bitfinex Securities can now tap into a market hungry for regulated investment opportunities, as reported.</p>
<p>According to the announcement, with the token to be issued on the Liquid Network, a Bitcoin sidechain, investors can participate in this project, trading the token against US dollars and Tether&#8217;s USDT stablecoin.</p>
<img alt="Tethers USDT market cap capitalisation on TradingView amid Bitfinex news" height="1496" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/w34NN4fd/" width="2770" />
<p>Furthermore, beyond its financial implications, the tokenized debt issuance holds the potential to catalyze economic growth and job creation in <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/country-el-salvador-buying-bitcoin-btc/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">El Salvador</a>.</p>
<p>According to the announcement, with a target to generate 1,000 jobs during the construction phase and up to 5,000 jobs upon the complex&#8217;s operation, the initiative underscores the impact of crypto-powered investments on local communities.</p>
<p>Roberto Laguardia, president of Inversiones Laguardia, noted: </p>
<blockquote><p>The recently implemented digital asset laws will grant us access to capital markets that were previously unavailable to us. This access will allow us to develop crucial tourism-related infrastructure, thereby unlocking the potential for growth in the tourism sector. This expansion will ultimately result in economic benefits for every Salvadoran citizen.</p></blockquote>

<h2>El Salvador As A Crypto Hub Nation</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, El Salvador continues to boast of being a crypto hub in the region. The country’s Ministry of Education, in <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-goes-to-school-in-el-salvador/">collaboration with the nonprofit organization “Mi Primer Bitcoin” (MPB),</a> or “My First Bitcoin” in English, embarked on an initiative to introduce crypto education as an integral part of the public school curriculum.

<title>Bitcoin At A Discount: Whales Continue To Gobble Up Every Price Dip</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-at-a-discount-whales/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-at-a-discount-whales/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要: 这些信息是积极的。文章指出，比特币的鲸鱼持仓规模正在迅速增长，显示出大型投资者对比特币的强劲需求。随着比特币的供应减半事件即将来临，投资者对其未来展望持乐观态度。热门加密货币分析师预测，一旦比特币成功突破70800美元，可能会迎来新的历史高点，目标价位为85000美元。根据最新数据，目前比特币的价格为70895美元，显示出一定的增长趋势。 <div>
<p>Despite already possessing more <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-the-ultimate-bitcoin-guide-for-new-cryptocurrency-investors/">Bitcoin</a> than over half the crypto community, numerous BTC whales continue to rapidly acquire the cryptocurrency. Thus, taking advantage of any slight dips in its price as <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-correction-68800/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">buying opportunities to purchase and HODL</a> the pioneer cryptocurrency. </p>
<h2>Whale Appetite For Bitcoin Continues To Grow</h2>
<p>Usually, it might appear that <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-1-2-million-btc-spree/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">investors with minimal amounts of Bitcoin</a> would be the ones increasing their holdings by acquiring more of the cryptocurrency. However, recent data from CryptoQuant has <a href="https://x.com/cryptoquant_com/status/1777747704170635382?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">suggested</a> otherwise, indicating that the current demand for Bitcoin has actually been growing stronger from large-scale investors. </p>

<p>According to the on-chain analytics provider, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-demand-miner-issuance-unprecedented-degree/">BTC&#8217;s demand growth</a> has been around the highest ever, at 11% month on month. A significant portion of this demand comes from <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-whales-7-billion-shopping-spree-new-ath/">Bitcoin whales</a>, who have been accumulating the token at a rapid pace. </p>
<p>Julio Monero, the Head of Research at CryptoQuant <a href="https://x.com/jjcmoreno/status/1778092192835268829?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">revealed</a> in a recent blog post that the BTC <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-halving-no-longer-driving/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">demand growth from large holders</a> has been one of the major catalysts triggering price rallies in the cryptocurrency. The report indicates the appetite for Bitcoin among these whales has surged to unprecedented levels, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-open-interest-all-time-high-btc-72000/">underscoring the high value</a> and acceptance of this pioneer cryptocurrency. </p>
<p>Furthermore, with the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-halving-2900-blocks/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Bitcoin halving event</a> fast approaching, the hype surrounding the cryptocurrency’s future outlook has been growing steadily. The cyclic halving event could be one of the potential reasons for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-whales-go-shopping-purchase-6-16-billion/">large-scale investors displaying an insatiable thirst</a> for acquiring the cryptocurrency, as many crypto investors and analysts <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/why-bitcoin-halving-could-provide-a-big-boost-to-these-altcoins-growth/">anticipate</a> a bullish outlook for BTC following the halving event.</p>
<h2>Crypto Analyst Reveals BTC&#8217;s Next Price Target</h2>
<p>On Tuesday, April 9, popular crypto analyst, Ali Martinez <a href="https://x.com/ali_charts/status/1777249436202082387?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">predicted</a> that Bitcoin could witness a surge to a new all-time high once it successfully breaks above $70,800.</p>
<p>Sharing a price chart illustrating <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-reclaims-66k/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">BTC&#8217;s price movement</a> based on a technical pattern, Martinez expressed enthusiasm for a potential bullish breakout for the cryptocurrency. The crypto analyst disclosed that if BTC could maintain a price above $70,800, the cryptocurrency’s next target could become $85,000. </p>

<p>Additionally, market intelligence platform Santiment has <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-fees-near-cycle-lows-halving-change-this/">revealed</a> that possible declines in Bitcoin’s price are presently viewed as “<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-huge-discount-pre-halving-dip-buy/">dip buy opportunities</a>,” as panic stays high to justify a potential recovery. </p>
<p>At the time of writing Bitcoin is trading at $70,895, reflecting a 24-hour daily increase of 2.84% and a weekly increase of 6.94%, according to CoinMarketCap. The cryptocurrency has already successfully crossed Martinez’s $70,800 threshold, however, it remains to be seen if Bitcoin can effectively hold onto its new price point, to potentially amass gains up to $85,000.</p>

<link>https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-emurgo-huawei-cloud-partnership/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-emurgo-huawei-cloud-partnership/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[

<p>EMURGO, a foundational arm of the Cardano network, has <a href="https://twitter.com/emurgo_io/status/1778242733028905273" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">partnered</a> with Huawei Cloud to amplify the network&#8217;s presence and enhance its cloud-based blockchain solutions. Announced on April 11, 2024, this strategic alliance integrates EMURGO&#8217;s blockchain prowess with Huawei Cloud&#8217;s formidable infrastructure, aiming to accelerate Web3 adoption across the region.</p>
<h2>Cardano Expands In Asia</h2>
<p>At the heart of this partnership is the establishment of a Cardano <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-validating-nodes-more-attainable-as-eth-price-collapses/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Validator Node</a> on Huawei Cloud.

<p>A key aspect of this collaboration is the project’s access to Huawei’s Marketplace, a renowned platform frequented by leading enterprises globally. This integration will significantly extend the reach and applicability of Cardano’s Web3 solutions, fostering innovative applications and services within the blockchain ecosystem.</p>

<p>The partnership thus stands as a beacon of innovation, inviting developers to explore new frontiers in Web3 development on a secure and scalable cloud platform.</p>

<p>Rex Lei Yang, Managing Director of Huawei Cloud Singapore, highlighted the strategic advantage this partnership offers to Huawei Cloud: “Collaborating with EMURGO enables us access to an expansive network of Web3 developers and innovative solutions on the Cardano blockchain network. This is a significant step towards future-proofing Huawei Cloud’s business and solidifying our position as a leader in the cloud ecosystem.”</p>

<p>Furthermore, the partnership also underscores EMURGO’s commitment to extending the ADA ecosystem across major economies in Asia Pacific and Africa. With an established presence in regions including Singapore, Indonesia, India, and Japan, EMURGO aims to further cement its footprint, leveraging more than 3,000 <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/arthur-hayes-cardano-dog-shit-hoskinson-reacts/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">stake pools</a> or validators that secure the network.</p>
<p>The Cardano accelerator, Adaverse, and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-developer-emurgo-undaunted-by-bear-market/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">EMURGO Africa</a>, are pivotal to this expansion, enhancing accessibility and utility across the continents.</p>
<p>At press time, ADA traded at $0.583.</p>

<title>Shiba Inu Burn Rate Spikes 48,554% In One Day – Here’s What Happened</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-burn-rate-48554/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-burn-rate-48554/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章讨论了Shiba Inu燃烧率在上周的下降以及本周的突然增长。燃烧率在24小时内增长了48,554.74%，总共烧掉了87.76万个代币。这次增长似乎是有机的，表明对减少流通中代币数量的积极情绪。尽管比上周下降了4.63%，但这种燃烧趋势可能有助于价格上涨。 <div>
<p class="p2"><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-burn-rate-down-28/">Shiba Inu saw a lull in its burn rate</a> last week, which coincided with the decline in the price of the meme coin. During this time, the number of tokens being burned on a daily basis dropped tremendously, causing the burn rate to suffer. However, as this week draws to a close, there has been a turn in the tide, with the Shiba Inu burn rate seeing a massive uptick in its burn rate, spurred on by the lead developer of the project.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Shiba Inu Burn Rate Climbs 48,554%</h2>
<p class="p2">According to <a href="https://www.shibburn.com/#google_vignette" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">data</a> from the Shiba Inu burn tracking website, Shibburn, there has been a notable increase in the number of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-shiba-inu-price-red/">SHIB tokens</a> being sent to the burn address. In the 24-hour period, a total of 87.76 million tokens have been incinerated, leading to a 48,554.74% spike in the burn rate.</p>

<p class="p2">Interestingly, the total number of tokens burned only came from two wallets. The first transaction was from the “<a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x13c9ff3a4eeb59b5730c696809ccaf0802f0c86036a20d9f73ae4feea27c3bdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">0xb8001c3</a>” wallet which sent a total of 61.9 million tokens to the burn on Wednesday. The next transaction would come only two hours later from the “<a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xc5d3a25ff9b7dedc100cac668c2eaa6017baeb4b875f52158b13ae9cc609c703" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">0xa9d1e0</a>” wallet, which carried 25.85 million SHIB tokens.</p>
<p class="p2">This was a huge difference compared to the prior day which had seen only 180,375 tokens burned in one transaction in a 24-hour period. This abysmal number saw the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-burn-rate-17000/">Shiba Inu burn rate</a> fall drastically, leading to a 99.59% decrease in burn rate.</p>
<p class="p2">On the weekly timeframe, the burn rate is still performing poorly compared to the prior week, despite the surge in the last day. Shibburn’s data <a href="https://x.com/shibburn/status/1778377501317697988" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">shows</a> 275.57 million tokens burned in the last seven days, which constitutes a 4.63% decline.</p>
<h2 class="p2">What Triggered The Surge In The SHIB Burn Rate?</h2>
<p class="p2">There are often various triggers for a surge in burn rates, ranging from improved community sentiment to the Shiba Inu team itself burning tokens. However, this time around, it was neither of those things as the current burn trend looks to be rather organic.</p>

<p class="p2">This could suggest a return in positive sentiment for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-burn-rate-99-crash/">Shiba Inu investors</a>, especially when it comes to trying to reduce the number of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-shiba-inu-price-red/">SHIB</a> tokens in circulation. By reducing supply, it enables demand to rise above supply, thereby increasing the meme coin’s price in the process.</p>
<p class="p2"><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-woofs-its-way-to-dubais-web3-summit/">SHIB’s price</a> is currently seeing small gains of 0.32% after the burn transactions were carried out. However, with the Bitcoin price fluctuating and favoring a downtrend, the start to the recovery may only be short-lived.</p>

<title>Thailand Throws Jab At Crypto With P2P Purchase Ban – Details</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/thailand-throws-jab-at-crypto-with-p2p-purchase-ban/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/thailand-throws-jab-at-crypto-with-p2p-purchase-ban/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。泰国当局加强合作努力，着重监管涉及加密货币的P2P交易，以遏制网络诈骗。监管机构致力于制定严格规定以监督和限制P2P交易，并通过多机构合作打击在线诈骗。此外，加强对用于网络诈骗的银行账户和SIM卡的快速处理，以保护金融生态系统的完整性。 <div>
<p>In a concerted effort to tackle the escalating threat of online fraud, state authorities in Thailand have joined forces, emphasizing the need to regulate peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions involving cryptocurrencies. Led by Prasert Jantararuangthong, the Minister of Digital Economy and Society (DES), the collaborative initiative aims to curb the rampant <a href="https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/general/2774524/online-scam-crackdown-focuses-on-p2p-crypto-channel" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">use of P2P channels by scammers</a> to launder money obtained through illicit activities.</p>

<p>Amid growing concerns over the proliferation of online scams in Thailand, recent estimates suggest that the damage inflicted by fraudulent schemes amounts to a staggering 100 million baht per day. Shockingly, a significant portion of fraudsters, approximately 80%, exploit the unregulated nature of P2P <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">cryptocurrency</a> transactions to evade detection and traceability, posing a formidable challenge to law enforcement agencies.</p>
<h2><strong>Thailand: Regulatory Focus Sharpens On P2P Crypto Transactions</strong></h2>
<p>Recognizing the urgency of the situation, regulatory authorities, particularly the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), are spearheading efforts to develop stringent rules governing P2P cryptocurrency exchanges. With scammers increasingly leveraging digital assets to perpetrate fraud, the SEC emphasizes the necessity of adapting existing regulations to effectively supervise and restrict P2P transactions.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/zCrN0mpU/" width="1835" /></p>

<p>In response to Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin&#8217;s directive to demonstrate tangible progress within 30 days, Minister Prasert underscores the imperative of regulatory intervention to address the vulnerabilities inherent in P2P crypto channels. Failure to enact robust measures could prompt the introduction of a new regulatory framework aimed specifically at regulating P2P cryptocurrency purchases.</p>
<h2><strong>Collaborative Measures To Thwart Online Fraud </strong></h2>
<p>The crackdown on online fraud in Thailand extends beyond regulatory adjustments, encompassing a multi-agency approach involving key stakeholders from the public and private sectors.</p>
<p>Representatives from the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission (NBTC), the Anti-Money Laundering Office (Amlo), banking associations, and law enforcement agencies converge to devise comprehensive strategies to combat the scourge of online scams.</p>

<p>In a bid to disrupt the operations of fraudulent syndicates, authorities are intensifying efforts to integrate data and intelligence sharing among relevant agencies. The Anti-Online Scam Operation Centre (AOC), in collaboration with the DES Ministry, spearheads initiatives to collate information on mule accounts, SIM cards, and illicit online platforms, facilitating targeted enforcement actions.</p>
<strong>Swift Action Against Mule Accounts And SIM Cards</strong>
<p>The central bank and the Thai Bankers&#8217; Association are taking decisive steps to stem the tide of online fraud by swiftly identifying and dismantling mule accounts utilized by scammers. Recent actions by Amlo have resulted in the closure of hundreds of thousands of mule bank accounts, dealing a significant blow to criminal networks engaged in fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the NBTC is leveraging its regulatory authority to address the proliferation of mule SIM cards in Thailand, mandating stringent identity verification measures for individuals possessing multiple SIM cards. By tightening controls on telecommunications infrastructure, authorities seek to disrupt the operational capabilities of fraudsters, thereby safeguarding the integrity of the financial ecosystem.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Bulls Unite: Cathie Wood’s $2.3 Million Forecast Gains Support from Robert Kiyosaki</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/robert-kiyosaki-back-cathie-woods-bitcoin-forecast/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/robert-kiyosaki-back-cathie-woods-bitcoin-forecast/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章讨论了著名的作者和投资者Robert Kiyosaki对Cathie Woods的Ark Invest对比特币的大胆预测表示支持。Ark Invest预测比特币可能会达到惊人的高度，Kiyosaki对此表示认同。他认为Wood具有智慧和可靠的判断力，虽然预测可能不准确，但重要的是持有多少比特币。Kiyosaki支持比特币，并预测其价格将在未来大幅增长。 <div>
<p>Famous acclaimed author and investor Robert Kiyosaki has publicly <a href="https://x.com/theRealKiyosaki/status/1778265859355820228" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">endorsed</a> Cathie Woods&#8217; Ark Invest audacious prediction on Bitcoin, demonstrating a noteworthy agreement of viewpoints toward the potential for the crypto asset to reach unprecedented heights.</p>
<p>This unity is evidence of the increasing number of people in the financial community who are confident that the asset has the potential to be a game-changer with exponential growth potential.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin At $2.3 Million Is Not Unreasonable</h2>
<p>In a February <a href="https://x.com/WuBlockchain/status/1752882317423706334" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">report</a> titled &#8220;Big Ideas 2024,&#8221; Ark Invest made an intriguing projection that might have a significant effect on the cryptocurrency market, especially <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-fees-near-cycle-lows-halving-change-this/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin</a>. The research examines multiple scenarios and projects the possible price movements of BTC depending on varying global asset allocation degrees.</p>

<p>Specifically, their analysis suggests that investing more than 19% of the world&#8217;s assets, valued at a whopping $250 trillion in BTC, may cause it to soar to an all-time high of $2.3 million. It is worth noting that the firm considers the asset as a trustworthy risk-off asset that is often viewed as a haven during times of market turbulence.</p>
<p>Starting off, Robert Kiyosaki highlighted his confidence in the bold prediction. He said that this is because he believes the firm&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cathie-wood-refutes-jpmorgan-ceo-label-for-bitcoin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Cathie Wood</a> is incredibly intelligent and her judgment is reliable.</p>
<p>Although he noted that Wood&#8217;s forecast could be wrong, the crucial question here is what people in the community believe. However, amidst speculations about whether she could be right or wrong, the most important perspective to consider is how much Bitcoin an individual holds.</p>
<p>Should Cathie Wood&#8217;s projections prove to be correct, Kiyosaki asserts he will regret not acquiring more <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-will-btc-prices-follow-rampant-gold/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">BTC</a> over time. On the other hand, if she turns out to be wrong, he will be happy not to have owned any.</p>
<p>Even though Wood&#8217;s claims might be correct or not, Kiyosaki underscored ignorance within the crypto space, saying that the majority of people will still possess zero BTC. &#8220;School is the only place on earth where &#8216;smart&#8217; people are people who never make mistakes,&#8221; he added. </p>
<p>According to the author, those who make mistakes and grow from them are the wealthiest and happiest persons in the real world. So far, Kiyosaki has commended the CEO for possessing the courage to make errors and learn from them, affirming that he also believes BTC will reach $2.3 million in the future.</p>
<h2>A Supporter Of BTC</h2>
<p>Aside from backing Wood&#8217;s viewpoints, the investor is a supporter of the largest cryptocurrency asset. Kiyosaki has been constantly <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/robert-kiyosaki-avocates-bitcoin-investment/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">advocating BTC</a>, urging the crypto community to invest in the coin rather than in fiat currencies which usually he labels &#8220;fake money.&#8221;</p>

<p>The acclaimed author has also made several bullish price targets for BTC this year. He projects that the impending halving event expected to take place in April will cause Bitcoin to spike to $100,000 by September. Additionally, he claims that Bitcoin might peak at the $300,000 threshold before the end of the year.</p>

<title>Dictators Beware: Bitcoin Might Be Your Downfall, Says Human Rights Foundation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章讨论了比特币在反对威权政权中的潜力作用，重点介绍了人权基金会首席战略官Alex Gladstein的见解。Gladstein强调比特币的核心原则，指出其对言论自由、财产权和开放资本市场的保护。他提到了比特币在支持异见运动中的历史作用，并展示了其在维权方面的巨大潜力。尽管比特币对中央集权的金融系统构成威胁，但也面临着来自威权政权的挑战和风险。然而，比特币已经成为争取自由和人权的一股破坏性力量。 <div>
<p>In a world marked by geopolitical tensions and struggles for freedom, Bitcoin emerges as a potential game-changer in the fight against authoritarian regimes. Alex Gladstein, Chief Strategy Officer of the <a href="https://hrf.org/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Human Rights Foundation (HRF)</a>, sheds light on the transformative power of Bitcoin in empowering individuals living under oppressive governments.</p>
<p>Gladstein&#8217;s insights, shared in a recent episode of the What Bitcoin Did podcast, underscore the pivotal role of this cryptocurrency in promoting freedom, privacy, and financial sovereignty.</p>

<p>Gladstein&#8217;s analysis centers on Bitcoin&#8217;s core principles, which stand in stark contrast to the control exerted by autocratic regimes. He highlights three key traits of society that every dictator fears: censorship, confiscation of assets, and closed capital markets.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Tyrants need censorship, confiscation, and closed capital markets</p>
<p>Bitcoin is free speech, property rights, and open capital markets</p>
<p>You do the math <img alt="✌" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/270c.png" style="height: 1em;" /><a href="https://t.co/8XLeyoqWIb" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/8XLeyoqWIb</a></p>
<p>— Alex Gladstein <img alt="🌋" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f30b.png" style="height: 1em;" /> <img alt="⚡" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/26a1.png" style="height: 1em;" /> (@gladstein) <a href="https://twitter.com/gladstein/status/1777766654111604786?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">April 9, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Drawing parallels with countries like China and Russia, Gladstein argues that Bitcoin&#8217;s decentralized nature offers a beacon of hope for citizens seeking to reclaim their rights. The Proof of Work (PoW) blockchain, which underpins Bitcoin, ensures free speech, protects personal property rights, and fosters open capital markets, posing a significant challenge to authoritarian control.</p>
<h2><strong>Bitcoin: A Tool For Liberation</strong></h2>
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s potential as a tool for liberation is not merely theoretical. Gladstein points to historical examples where the cryptocurrency played a pivotal role in supporting dissident movements. In 2011, when governmental institutions financially deprived WikiLeaks,</p>
<p><a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Bitcoin</a> emerged as an alternative payment method, enabling the organization to continue its operations. Similarly, in 2013, Bitcoin facilitated fundraising campaigns for Ukrainian protesters during the Maidan revolution, demonstrating its capacity to empower marginalized voices.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/jyBGtThn/" width="2475" /></p>

<p>The Human Rights Foundation (HRF) views Bitcoin as more than just a financial instrument; it sees it as a talisman of sovereignty, privacy, and freedom. This perspective is echoed by the recent developments in El Salvador, where Bitcoin was adopted as legal tender in 2021.</p>
<h2><strong>Countermeasures And Challenges</strong></h2>
<p>However, the rise of Bitcoin has not gone unnoticed by authoritarian regimes. Countries like China and Russia are actively exploring the development of their own central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) using blockchain technology.</p>
<p>These efforts indicate a recognition of the threat posed by Bitcoin to centralized control over financial systems. While Bitcoin offers hope for liberation, it also presents challenges and risks that must be navigated carefully.</p>

<p>As Bitcoin continues to gain traction globally, its impact on geopolitics and human rights remains a topic of intense debate. While some view it as a tool for empowerment and liberation, others caution against its potential pitfalls and risks.</p>
<p>Yet, one thing remains clear: Bitcoin has emerged as a disruptive force in the struggle for freedom and human rights, challenging the status quo and offering a glimmer of hope to those living under authoritarian rule.</p>

<title>XRP Best Positioned For A US ETF After Bitcoin, Ripple CEO Reiterates</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-best-positioned-us-etf-after-bitcoin-ripple-ceo/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-best-positioned-us-etf-after-bitcoin-ripple-ceo/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。在巴黎区块链周活动中，Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse与Xrpl Commons CEO David Bchiri讨论了一系列与Ripple和XRP生态系统相关的话题。重点讨论了美国的现货ETF前景，Ripple今年计划推出美元稳定币，扩大社区的倡议，以及加密法规的情景。Garlinghouse强调了XRP在美国的监管清晰性，以及计划在今年推出USD稳定币，并鼓励加密ETF的发展，认为这将增强市场安全性和韧性，有利于投资社区。 <div>
<p>At the recent Paris Blockchain Week, running from April 9-11, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse shared the stage with Xrpl Commons CEO David Bchiri, shedding light on a range of topics pertinent to Ripple and the broader XRP ecosystem. Key discussions focused on the prospect of a spot Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) in the United States, Ripple&#8217;s intentions to launch a USD stablecoin later this year, initiatives to expand the community, and the landscape of crypto regulation.</p>
<h2>Only XRP And Bitcoin Have Regulatory Clarity</h2>
<p>Garlinghouse, in his <a href="https://twitter.com/DROPZXRP/status/1777691622035124354" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">speech</a>, emphasized the importance of investment diversification within the crypto market, saying, “When friends of mine ask me, hey, I want to invest in crypto, how should I do that? I always say invest in a basket. I&#8217;m not saying just buy Bitcoin or just XRP. I&#8217;m saying you want to invest in a basket and have diversification.”</p>
<p>He highlighted the regulatory clarity that XRP enjoys in the United States, alongside Bitcoin, as a significant factor that sets it apart and could pave the way for future financial products like an ETF. While Garlinghouse expects altcoin ETFs to be delayed, he is still optimistic.</p>

<p>“So look, I think there will be other [US spot] ETFs. Unfortunately, I think it&#8217;s going to take a little bit of time because the United States SEC is fighting that,” the Ripple CEO stated. Furthermore, Garlinghouse emphasized the unique position which XRP has due to Ripple’s <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-lawsuit-ripple-sec-agreement-schedule/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">legal fight with the US Securities and Exchange Commission</a> (SEC):</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>But I think one of the things that people don&#8217;t fully understand, they haven&#8217;t really paid attention to: In the United States, there&#8217;s only two cryptos that have regulatory clarity — Bitcoin and because of the fight we had at the courts &#8211; XRP has regulatory clarity that it&#8217;s not a security. And so that is, I think it&#8217;s different, it does matter. To answer your macro point, look, there will be other ETFs in the United States.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The Ripple CEO also revealed plans for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-emerge-tether-upcoming-stablecoin-launch/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">launching a USD stablecoin</a> later in the year, a move that aligns with Ripple&#8217;s strategy to bolster its presence in the digital payments arena while adhering to regulatory frameworks. This announcement marks a significant step in Ripple&#8217;s efforts to expand its suite of offerings and address the needs of the market.</p>

<p>Previously, in a February <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-etf-debate-ripple-ceo-garlinghouse-weighs-in/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">interview</a> with “Bloomberg Crypto,” Garlinghouse expressed his strong enthusiasm for an XRP ETF, viewing it as an essential evolution for the crypto investment landscape. &#8220;I think it only makes sense,&#8221; he commented and drew parallels to the early stock market, where diversification was crucial for investment risk management.</p>
<p>Garlinghouse advocated for the development of cryptocurrency ETFs, suggesting they would enhance market safety and robustness, thereby benefiting the investment community. “It makes these markets safer. It makes them more robust. And so this is good for the investment community to kind of lean into that,” Garlinghouse remarked.</p>
<p>Despite being reticent about specific discussions with major issuers like <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-beats-okx-and-kraken-holdings/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">BlackRock</a> concerning an ETF, Garlinghouse acknowledged the importance of such a financial product for the community and Ripple&#8217;s role within this ecosystem. He expressed his strong support for the idea of an XRP ETF, stating, “We would certainly welcome it. I think it’s inevitable that there’ll be multiple ETFs around different tokens.”</p>
<p>At press time, XRP traded at $0.6169.</p>

<title>Urgent Stablecoin Regulation Needed, Global Financial Watchdog Says</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bis-urgent-stablecoin-regulation-needed/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bis-urgent-stablecoin-regulation-needed/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。国际清算银行(BIS)发出紧急全球监管监督稳定币的警报。BIS的最新报告强调了需要统一监管框架来解决目前碎片化的监管制约稳定币广泛采用的紧迫性。调查显示，目前的监管碎片化对稳定币创新产生了不利影响。国际机构呼吁协调监管，解决稳定币带来的挑战。同时，统一技术和安全指南为监管者建立了统一监管框架的基础。对稳定币与其他数字资产的互动进行进一步分析对全面理解其潜在影响至关重要。 <div>
<p>In a bid to navigate the complex landscape of stablecoin regulation, the <a href="https://www.bis.org/fsi/publ/insights57.htm" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bank for International Settlements</a> (BIS) has sounded the alarm for urgent global oversight.</p>
<p>The latest report from the BIS underscores the pressing need for a unified regulatory framework to address the significant regulatory fragmentation hindering the widespread adoption of stablecoins.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.bis.org/fsi/publ/insights57.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">The survey</a> conducted by BIS across 11 jurisdictions has shed light on the myriad challenges posed by the current patchwork of regulations governing stablecoins.</p>
<p>This fragmentation not only complicates compliance for issuers but also raises concerns about the potential risks posed to the stability of the global monetary system.</p>
<h2><strong>Fragmented Regulations Stifle Stablecoin Innovation</strong></h2>
<p>One of the key findings of the BIS report is the detrimental impact of regulatory heterogeneity on stablecoin innovation. Disparate regulations across jurisdictions result in uncertainty regarding issuer authorization, reserve requirements, and anti-money laundering measures. This <a href="https://fintechnews.sg/94415/digitalassets/bis-stablecoins-offer-promise-but-need-consistent-regulation/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">lack of clarity</a> stifles innovation and undermines the potential of stablecoins to revolutionize digital payments.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-293573" height="383" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/a_d0dc23.png?resize=786%2C383" width="786" /></p>

<p>Furthermore, the classification of stablecoins varies widely from country to country, leading to confusion regarding their legal status and redemption policies. While some jurisdictions treat stablecoins as fiat-pegged assets, others regulate them differently, with some outright banning certain types of stablecoins.</p>
<h2><strong>Call For Harmonized Regulation Gains Momentum</strong></h2>
<p>Amidst growing concerns over regulatory fragmentation, the BIS report calls for urgent action to harmonize stablecoin regulation on a global scale.</p>
<p>The need for a unified regulatory framework is echoed by international bodies such as the International Monetary Fund and the Financial Stability Board, emphasizing the importance of collaboration among regulators to address the challenges posed by stablecoins.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/nXFQrfQT/" width="2475" /></p>

<p>John Deaton, a prominent pro-crypto attorney, underscores the industry&#8217;s support for harmonized regulation, citing concerns raised by Senator Elizabeth Warren regarding the potential security and national security risks associated with stablecoins entering the banking system. Warren&#8217;s remarks highlight the urgency of implementing comprehensive regulatory measures to mitigate these risks effectively.</p>
<strong>Navigating The Road Ahead: Challenges And Opportunities</strong>
<p>While the call for global regulation is gaining momentum, navigating the road ahead poses significant challenges. Variations in reserve management, custodian requirements, audit standards, and liquidity provisions further complicate efforts to harmonize stablecoin regulation.</p>

<p>However, amidst these challenges lie opportunities for collaboration and innovation. Greater consistency in technological and security guidelines offers a foundation upon which regulators can build a unified regulatory framework.</p>
<p>Moreover, further analysis of stablecoins&#8217; interaction with other digital assets, including central bank digital currencies and tokenized funds, is crucial to fully understanding their potential impact on the global monetary system.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Core Developer Meeting Under FBI Scrutiny, Here’s Why</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-core-developer-meeting-fbi-scrutiny/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。<br />一位Bitcoin Core开发者Luke Dashjr的比特币被盗，涉案金额约360万美元。FBI要求调查有关Dashjr比特币被盗事件的CoreDev Atlanta 2022聚会出席者的信息，包括GitHub用户名、全名和电子邮件地址。事件凸显了加密货币社区在保护数字资产免受网络威胁方面面临的挑战，以及区块链技术发展中的隐私和安全原则。Bitcoin的交易价格为70433美元。 <div>
<p>A Bitcoin Core developer meeting has come under the FBI&#8217;s scrutiny. Mike Schmidt, Director at Brink—a charitable organization that funds open-source developers—has revealed in an email to attendees of the CoreDev Atlanta 2022 that the FBI issued a subpoena demanding information on those who were part of the October 2022 gathering. This subpoena is linked to the investigation into the theft of Bitcoin Core developer Luke Dashjr&#8217;s Bitcoins, a sum that Dashjr claims amounted to approximately $3.6 million.</p>
<p>The email sent by Schmidt reads: “Notice regarding the Atlanta 2022 CoreDev event. All, As part of the investigation into Luke Dashjr&#8217;s announced theft of his bitcoins, I received a subpoena from the FBI wanting information about attendees [&#8230;] I was legally advised to cooperate.” This subpoena, Schmidt explains, followed a legal obligation to not disclose its existence for a period of one year, a condition that has just reached its expiration.</p>

<p>The information requested by the FBI, as per Schmidt’s email, was eventually narrowed down to include GitHub usernames, first and last names, and email addresses of the attendees. “The original subpoena requested much information but after pushback, the FBI agent agreed to the following subset of information about you, which I provided,” Schmidt revealed.</p>
<p>He expressed regret over this privacy breach, stating, &#8220;I apologize for this breach of your private information. Please email me if you have any questions.”</p>

<p></p>
<h2>What Happened To Dashjr&#8217;s Bitcoins?</h2>
<p>This FBI investigation stems from an incident reported by <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-dev-critical-bug-not-everyone-agrees/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Luke Dashjr</a> on January 1 of the previous year. Dashjr, a central figure behind the Bitcoin blockchain&#8217;s development and a staunch advocate for the cryptocurrency&#8217;s decentralization principle, disclosed on social media that a significant portion of his BTC holdings were stolen from his storage wallets on New Year&#8217;s Eve. The theft, he detailed, was facilitated by the compromise of a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/law-enforcement-shuts-down-blackberry-pgp-communication-network/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">PGP</a> (Pretty Good Privacy) key, leading to a breach that compromised his digital assets.</p>

<p>Dashjr&#8217;s online plea <a href="https://twitter.com/LukeDashjr/status/1609613748364509184" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">highlighted</a> the severity of the situation: “PSA: My PGP key is compromised, and at least many of my bitcoins stolen. I have no idea how. Help please. [&#8230;] What the heck @FBI @ic3 why can&#8217;t I reach anyone???” His subsequent message confirmed the grim reality: &#8220;Nevermind many. It&#8217;s basically all gone.”</p>
<p>The breach, according to Dashjr, involved both &#8216;hot&#8217; wallets—those accessible over the internet—and what were believed to be<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/can-crypto-cold-wallets-help-measure-exchange-dominance/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> &#8216;cold&#8217; wallets</a>, theoretically isolated from online threats. The peculiar circumstances surrounding the theft, including prior security breaches reported by Dashjr, have added layers of complexity to the ongoing FBI investigation.</p>
<p>As the investigation unfolds, the implications of this subpoena on the broader Bitcoin development community and on principles of privacy and security within the space remain to be seen. The incident underscores the persistent challenges faced by individuals and organizations in safeguarding digital assets against sophisticated cyber threats, even as the pursuit of decentralization and security continues to drive the development of blockchain technology.</p>
<p>At press time, BTC traded at $70,433.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Fees Near Cycle Lows, Will Halving Change This?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。最近比特币网络的交易费用相对较低，这是由于网络上的交易费用接近周期低点。矿工最近收到的费用很低，平均每个区块的交易费用也相对较低。目前，比特币区块奖励为6.25 BTC，但随着即将到来的减半事件，奖励将减少到3.125 BTC。矿工的主要收入来源可能会逐渐转向交易费用。过去一年，交易费用已经在一些情况下与区块奖励相匹配，未来的推动力可能来自应用程序和收费。分析人士预期在下一次减半之前和之后，交易费用也将增加。比特币目前的价格为约69,400美元，过去一周上涨了超过3%。 <div>
<p>On-chain data shows the Bitcoin network has been quite cheap recently, as the transaction fee per block has been near cycle lows.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Miners Have Been Receiving Low Fees Recently</h2>
<p>As analyst James Van Straten pointed out in a new <a href="https://twitter.com/jvs_btc/status/1777447139703968027" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, the BTC transaction fee has been floating around cycle lows recently. The &#8220;<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-inscription-craze-fades-miner-fees-plunge/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">transaction fee</a>&#8221; here naturally refers to the fee that users must attach with their transfers on the Bitcoin blockchain as a reward for the miner who processes them.</p>
<p>This metric&#8217;s value is generally directly related to the traffic that the network is observing. In times of high activity, transactions can stay stuck for long periods in the mempool, as the network only has a limited capacity to handle moves.</p>

<p>Users who are in a hurry may opt for higher-than-average fees during such periods so that the miners prioritize their moves. During especially congested periods, the average fee can blow up as many senders compete with each other to get transfers through first.</p>
<p>When there is little traffic on the blockchain, though, the users don&#8217;t have much incentive to pay a significant fee, so the average on the network tends to stay low in such periods.</p>
<p>One way to gauge the trend in the transaction fee over a long period is to measure the average fee paid to the miners per block. The chart below shows how this metric&#8217;s value has changed for the Bitcoin network over the past few years.</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Average Fee Paid Per Block" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="1013" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GKrBqMQXMAANSkU?format=jpg&amp;name=large" width="1800" /></p>

<p>As the graph shows, the Bitcoin average fee paid per block has been pretty low recently. This suggests that the miners haven&#8217;t been earning much from fees.</p>
<p>In the same chart, data for the block subsidy (the total amount of rewards that miners receive per block) has also been displayed. It would appear that it has historically been quite rare for the transaction fees to match these rewards and at the current lows, the fee is also only a fraction of them.</p>
<p>The block subsidy and transaction fees combined make up for the entire revenue of the Bitcoin miners, but due to the imbalance between them, the former has been the main source of income for the miners.</p>
<p>While this has worked for these chain validators, it will not be the case forever. The BTC supply is limited, so miners eventually run out of block subsidies.</p>
<p>But even before that, there is a much more imminent threat posed by the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/by-numbers-how-bitcoin-mining-costs-post-halving/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">halvings</a>, periodic events where block rewards get permanently cut in half. Halvings occur every four years, with the next one coming up in about nine days.</p>
<p>At present, the BTC block subsidy is 6.25 BTC per block, but this halving would reduce it to 3.125 BTC. With every subsequent halving, this reward would only shrink further, meaning the main source of income for the miners would continue to get squeezed.</p>

<p>As such, the long-term future for the miners would lie in the transaction fees. This past year, the fee has matched the block reward in several instances, mainly fueled by the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-inscription-craze-fades-miner-fees-plunge/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Inscription mania</a>. Perhaps applications like the Inscriptions would be what will drive the fees in the future as well.</p>
<p>Straten has identified an interesting pattern in the fees&#8217; trend. It would appear that fees picked up before the last halving and continued to rise after it. The analyst expects something similar to play out this time as well.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $69,400, up more than 3% over the past week.</p>

<title>47 Out Of Every 100 Bitcoin Mined Stored By One Custodian: Analyst</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/47-out-of-every-100-bitcoin-one-custodian/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/47-out-of-every-100-bitcoin-one-custodian/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。一项研究发现，一个匿名的托管机构在比特币网络中扮演着至关重要的角色，占据着至少47%的总算力。这种集中控制可能带来安全风险和对托管机构的透明度和去中心化的需求。一些知名的比特币挖矿池对同一托管机构进行拜托，这可能导致中心化的币存储和对交易处理的控制。 <div>
<p>On-chain analysis now reveals that a single anonymous custodian, believed to be Cobo Custody, plays a crucial role in the Bitcoin network. In a <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/mononautical/status/1777686545715089605" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, one analyst said the custodian controls the Coinbase addresses of at least nine mining pools, cumulatively contributing at least 47% of the total hash rate. </p>
<p>This means that for every 100 freshly mined BTC, 47 BTC are sent to this custodian. Concentrating control in one entity raises concerns about the potential risks and the need for transparency and decentralization of custodians among mining pools.</p>
<img alt="BTC coinbase addresses | Source: Mempool Space" class="size-full wp-image-293499" height="461" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot128.png?resize=1024%2C461" width="1024" />
<h2>Bitcoin Mining Pool Overreliant On One Custodian</h2>
<p>The finding noted that popular Bitcoin mining pools like AntPool, F2Pool, Binance Pool, Braiins, btccom, SECPOOL, and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/poolin-mining-pool-freezes-btc-eth-withdrawals/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Poolin</a> channel their Coinbase to the same custodian. Additionally, ULTIMUSPOOL and 1THash&#8217;s Coinbase addresses are also reportedly controlled by the same entity. </p>
<p>Luxor previously used the same custodian but changed its setup after it was noted that they also relied on the custodian.</p>
<p>A Coinbase address is a specific address associated with a mining pool. Whenever a mining pool succeeds in confirming a block of transactions every 10 minutes and is rewarded with 6.25 BTC in the current epoch, it sends these coins to its Coinbase address.</p>

<p>This consolidation raises concerns about centralization in coin storage. Technically, Bitcoin is powered by a decentralized web of miners, none of which control over 50% of the total hash rate. </p>
<p>The hash rate is the measure of computing power dedicated to the network. The higher it is, the more secure the platform becomes against attacks. According to <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_network_hash_rate" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">YCharts</a>, the Bitcoin network currently has a hash rate of 603 EH/s.</p>
<img alt="Bitcoin hash rate | Source: YCharts" class="size-full wp-image-293498" height="406" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot127.png?resize=1024%2C406" width="1024" />
<h2>Security And Centralization Risks</h2>
<p>Fresh studies show that a single entity controls nearly half of all newly minted BTC, which could pose a security risk. If this custodian is compromised, these mining pools could lose heavily, impacting the network&#8217;s overall security and sentiment.</p>
<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/x/wZTRxuXf/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Bitcoin price trending sideways on the daily chart | Source: BTCUSDT on Binance, TradingView" class="size-full" height="904" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/wZTRxuXf/" width="1787" /></a>
<p>Besides relying on one custodian for their Coinbase, the study also found that the nine pools provide a hash rate for AntPool&#8217;s transaction accelerator service. The custodian is said to frequently use AntPool and ViaBTC&#8217;s transaction acceleration services for large batch withdrawals. </p>

<p>Usually, transaction accelerators are meant to fast-track the confirmation speeds of certain transactions. While convenient, especially when the network is congested, accelerators can risk centralizing control over transaction processing.</p>

<title>Examining The $100M Mango Markets Exploit, Latest Updates From Avraham Eisenberg’s Trial</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/latest-updates-the-100m-mango-markets-exploit/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/latest-updates-the-100m-mango-markets-exploit/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。在纽约联邦法院开始审判被指控策划价值1亿美元Mango Markets的Avraham Eisenberg后，揭露了该丑闻的细节。指控称Eisenberg涉嫌欺诈和市场操纵，在20分钟内将交易所的MNGO代币提升了1000%，据称借款1.1亿美元的加密货币实际上是窃取而不是合法贷款。辩护律师表示，Eisenberg的行为在加密货币交易的“投机领域”中属于正常操作，主张其行为并不违法。此案也引发了有关自治代码和智能合约在区块链技术中的作用的广泛讨论。<br /> <div>
<p>In a significant development for the cryptocurrency industry, the trial of Avraham Eisenberg, the accused perpetrator of the $100 million Mango Markets <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/court-trial-mango-markets-exploiter-set-in-april/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">exploit</a>, has commenced in a New York federal court. </p>
<h2>Details Of The Mango Markets Scandal</h2>
<p>During the <a href="https://x.com/innercitypress/status/1777689619523309593" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">opening arguments</a> presented by Assistant US Attorney Tian Huang, Eisenberg&#8217;s actions on October 11, 2022, were characterized as fraud and market manipulation. </p>
<p>Huang outlined how Eisenberg allegedly inflated the exchange&#8217;s MNGO token by 1000% in just 20 minutes and exploited Mango Markets by convincing them that he owned a significant amount. </p>
<p>Eisenberg is accused of borrowing over $110 million in cryptocurrency, later revealed as theft rather than a legitimate loan.</p>

<p>The prosecution further detailed Eisenberg&#8217;s alleged efforts to conceal his true identity, including posing as a Ukrainian woman and his swift escape from the country the day after the exploit. </p>
<p>Despite <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/mango-markets-exploiter-returns-funds-statement/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">offering to return</a> some stolen funds, Mango Markets still incurred substantial losses. Eisenberg was arrested upon his return to the United States several months later and charged with fraud.</p>
<p>As the trial progressed on Tuesday, the defense, led by Eisenberg&#8217;s counsel Sanford Talkin, argued that Mango Markets and Eisenberg operated in the &#8220;speculative realm&#8221; of cryptocurrency trading, where the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/mango-markets-avraham-eisenberg-wants-to-keep-funds/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">risks and rewards</a> are ‘significant.” </p>
<p>Talkin insists that Eisenberg executed a &#8220;successful trade,&#8221; risked $13 million of his own money, and operated within the &#8220;bounds of transparency. </p>
<p>The defense emphasizes that every trade has a winning and a losing side and asserts that executing a profitable trade is not inherently illegal.</p>
<p>Considering all of these factors, Mango Markets is seeking damages in the amount of $47 million, plus interest, calculated from the date of the attack.</p>
<h2>Eisenberg Trial&#8217;s Impact On Blockchain Technology </h2>
<p>The case also raises broader questions regarding the role of autonomous code and smart contracts in the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sec-and-cftc-action-mango-markets-hacker-boost-defi/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">crypto industry.</a> </p>
<p>Crypto lawyer Gabriel Shapiro points out that the final ruling on Eisenberg&#8217;s case could have far-reaching consequences for the industry, potentially challenging the notion of finality and immutability associated with autonomous code. </p>
<p>In a recent <a href="https://x.com/lex_node/status/1777811000512663825" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post </a>on the social media site X (formerly Twitter), Shapiro raised whether courts intervening retroactively in the results of autonomous code would render such code illegal. Shapiro stated in its post:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is a much more important case to the future of crypto than SBF or Terra, but y&#8217;all are sleeping on it. . . ask yourself: if courts can post hoc contravene the results of autonomous code, is autonomous code essentially illegal? the whole idea is finality and immutability&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>As the trial progresses and arguments are presented from both sides, how the court will rule on the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cftc-sues-trade-over-mango-markets-scam/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">charges</a> against Avraham Eisenberg remains to be seen. </p>
<p>The ruling and subsequent discussions will undoubtedly reverberate throughout the cryptocurrency community, shedding light on blockchain technology&#8217;s legal landscape and its potential impact on the industry&#8217;s future.</p>
<img alt="Mango Markets" class="size-medium" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/5zc7qzWx/" width="1815" />
<p>Following the highly anticipated trial of Mango Markets, the native token MNGO has maintained its remarkable upward trajectory, experiencing a significant recovery of 124% year-to-date. </p>
<p>Moreover, over the past 30 days, the token has demonstrated a noteworthy uptrend of 174%, resulting in the current trading price for MNGO standing at $0.0399. </p>

<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/binance-substantial-shiba-inu/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />文章揭示了币安发布的最新报告，显示用户在交易所持有的数万亿令牌。币安持有超过67万亿Shiba Inu令牌，净资产与客户净资产的比率超过100％。报告显示，币安目前在客户净资产中持有大约65.3万亿SHIB令牌，而币安的净资产保留了67.6万亿SHIB令牌。币安的净资产始终超过客户净资产，确保资产得到100％支持。此外，币安保留了应急基金以防极端情况发生。币安还使用Merkle Tree功能来验证资产，保证资金被100％支持。 <div>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-latest-reserve-report/">Binance</a>, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, has released its latest <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/binance-upgrades-proof-of-reserves-verification-for-better-user-privacy/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Proof of Reserve (PoR)</a> report, displaying trillions of Shiba Inu tokens held by users on the exchange. </p>
<h2>Binance Holds Over 67 Trillion Shiba Inu Tokens</h2>
<p>On Monday, April 1, Binance <a href="https://www.binance.com/en-GB/proof-of-reserves" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">published</a> its 17th proof of reserve report. The exchange revealed a ratio of over 100% between the net balances of all of its digital assets and customer net balance. </p>
<p>The ratio of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-meme-shiba-inu-dogecoin/">Shiba Inu native token SHIB</a> was approximately 103.60%, highlighting the exchange&#8217;s commitment to safeguarding users&#8217; assets by collateralizing them at a 1:1 ratio.</p>

<p>As disclosed by the report, Binance currently holds about 65,321,321,452,095.36 (65.3 trillion) SHIB tokens in its customer net balance, while Binance&#8217;s net balance boasts a reserve of 67,670,462,296,521 (67.6 trillion) SHIB. </p>
<p>With the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-shib-price-recover/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">price of Shiba Inu</a> trading around $0.0000276 at the time of writing and reflecting a steep decrease of 5.83%, this puts users’ Shiba Inu deposits at a value of more than $1.8 billion. Alternatively, Binance’s total SHIB reserves are worth over $1.86 billion.</p>
<p>In contrast to its <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-doge-shib-xrp-holds/">SHIB reserve in February</a>, the amount of SHIB tokens in Binance’s latest report has slightly reduced, suggesting that investors may have potentially liquidated a small portion of their holdings. Around February and March 2024, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-surge-in-interest/">interest and hype surrounding Shiba Inu peaked</a>, prompting numerous investors to invest in the doggy-themed meme coin. Fueled by the increasing demand, the cryptocurrency had recorded double-digit gains and became one of the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-takes-over-the-internet-google-searches-climb-as-global-interest-surges/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">most searched crypto assets on Google</a>. </p>
<h2>Proof Of Reserve Shows 100% Backed Assets</h2>
<p>Binance’s regular release of its proof of research report is a way of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-launches-proof-of-reserves-system/">maintaining transparency</a> and accountability for its users. The exchange has revealed that its proof of reserves encompasses all of the assets it holds in custody for users. </p>
<p>Moreover, Binance has stated that its <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-new-proof-of-reserves/">digital assets are 100% fully backed</a>, ensuring that client’s funds are safe and well collateralized. Binance uses a unique strategy to ensure all user assets in its reserve are protected. </p>

<p>The exchange has provided funds to cover all users’ assets in a ratio of 1:1, as well as some reserves. This essentially means that the exchange’s net balance would always exceed its customer’s net balance. In addition, when a user deposits one Bitcoin or 1,000 <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-shib-price-major-breakout/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Shiba Inu tokens</a>, Binance’s reserves increase by at least one BTC or 1,000 SHIB. </p>
<p>Binance also revealed that it always keeps emergency funds (SAFU funds) for extreme cases. This is to ensure the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-ripe-rally-exchange-liquidity-fast-dropping/">exchange’s liquidity management</a> and mitigate losses from market volatility.  </p>
<p>Additionally, the exchange disclosed that it currently <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-has-no-debt/">has zero debt</a> in its capital structure, utilizing the Merkle Tree feature to allow users to verify their assets to confirm that their funds are backed 100% and are held in a 1:1 ratio.</p>

<title>Taiwanese Crypto Exchange Founder Charged With Money Laundering And Fraud</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。台湾加密货币交易所ACE的创始人潘大卫被指控与其他六名嫌疑人一起涉嫌欺诈和洗钱。调查揭示了ACE交易所创始人潘大卫和林南“欺骗”受害者投资毫无价值的虚拟货币的“精心组织”的计划。检方起诉了潘等七人，并扣押了他们的资产，涉案金额高达约台币3.4亿元。ACE在声明中与其创始人保持距离，保证用户资产的安全。 <div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">David Pan, the founder of the Taiwanese crypto exchange ACE, alongside six other suspects, has been charged by prosecutors with fraud and money laundering. According to the official press release, a court ruled the confiscation of Pan’s assets.</p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto Fraud Investigation Ends With Indictment And Seizing Of Assets</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In January 2024, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/major-taiwanese-crypto-exchange-under-investigation/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">news broke</a> of one of the largest crypto exchanges in Taiwan being under police investigation for alleged fraud. The investigation unveiled a “well-organized” scheme by ACE exchange founders David Pan and Lin Nam to “deceive” victims into investing in worthless virtual currencies.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The police raided over 15 locations, including ACE headquarters, and arrested 14 individuals, including Pan and Lin, as part of the investigation. Additionally, over NT$200 million, worth $6.4 million, were seized during the raids.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The investigation of the suspected money laundering and fraud of ACE and its investee company, Fu Hai Digital Innovation Company, continued. As a result, the Taichung District Attorney&#8217;s Office prosecutors <a href="https://www.tcc.moj.gov.tw/media/354574/%E8%87%BA%E4%B8%AD%E5%9C%B0%E6%AA%A2%E7%BD%B2%E5%81%B5%E8%BE%A6%E7%8E%8B%E7%89%8C-ace-%E7%AD%89%E5%85%AC%E5%8F%B8%E6%B6%89%E5%AB%8C%E6%B4%97%E9%8C%A2%E7%AD%89%E6%A1%88%E4%BB%B6-%E7%B6%93%E6%AA%A2%E5%AF%9F%E5%AE%98%E5%81%B5%E6%9F%A5%E7%B5%82%E7%B5%90%E6%8F%90%E8%B5%B7%E5%85%AC%E8%A8%B4.pdf?mediaDL=true" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">indicted</a> Pan and six other suspects with criminal charges this week.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The defendants are accused of violating the Organized Crime Prevention Ordinance, aggravated fraud, and money laundering. The press release states that 162 victims were affected, and the money lost in the fraud amounts to over NT$340 million, worth around $10.7 million.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The prosecutors asked the Taiwanese court to consider that the “circumstances of the crime are significant, and the malice is grave.” As a result, a judge approved the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-assets-to-be-seized-by-spanish-treasury-in-new-tax-reform/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">seizing</a> of property of the seven individuals accused.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Around NT$3.48 million in crypto was seized, alongside NT$ 27.5 million in real estate properties, NT$140,000 in deposits, and NT$485,000 in cash. The total amount seized reaches over NT$31.6 million.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Web of Lies And ACE&#8217;s Response</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Prosecutors found that the defendants engaged in “offline and over-the-counter transactions of virtual currencies through the ‘Alfred Wallet’ App.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">According to the press release, Fu Hai created the Alfred Wallet and offered the A+Card, which was used for fraud. The virtual currency stored-value cards were sold in cooperation with fake investment online groups that promoted them.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">With the help of social media groups, the fraudsters promoted and hyped investing in virtual currencies, as crypto “could yield considerable returns.” Moreover, they promoted the purchase of TIDE tokens from specific dealers.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Per the investigation, the accused took advantage of the broad belief that physical stores are more trustworthy. As a result, they urged the victims to purchase their tokens at local stores authorized to operate Fu Hai’s Alfred Wallet.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Personnel in the store would aid the victims in using the A+Card to store their tokens in the Alfred Wallet. However, the defendants used the “operation mode” of the app to manage the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/new-crypto-heist-alert-hacker-drains-5-6m-from-data-storage-platform-wallet/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">wallets</a>. Using this method, the “transfer of currency flows could not be publicly queried in the blockchain ledger.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Subsequently, the system was used to manipulate the addresses of users’ wallets and control the funds from the backend. When victims tried withdrawing their funds, the members of the fraudulent group would find excuses like “wrong orders” and “account problems” or refuse to give reasons.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Following the indictment, ACE <a href="https://ace.io/news/1466" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">published</a> a statement distancing itself from its founder. The crypto exchange clarified that the Alfred Wallet was not an ACE product, as it “was developed by a third party commissioned by the former director Pan.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, the exchange reassured users that its trading and operating conditions were normal, guaranteeing the safety of its users’ assets.</p>

<title>XRP Price Ready To Surge: Crypto Expert Says XRP To Experience Supply Shock With Token Burns</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-price-massive-token-burn/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-price-massive-token-burn/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />文章提到了XRP可能经历供应冲击，这可能是由于XRP桥梁的建立和XRP锁定的增加。文章还提到了DeFi活动对XRP账本的影响。此外，文章强调了XRPL和以太坊网络上稳定币的发行以及XRPL上的新流动性桥梁等发展对XRP的采用和效用增长的积极影响。 <div>
<p><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/crypto-founder-xrp-price-22/#:~:text=He%20further%20stated%20that%20the,could%20hit%20%2422%20next%20year." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Crypto expert Zach Rector </a>has raised the possibility of XRP undergoing a supply shock due to a potential <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-burns-bright-shib/">massive token burn</a>, which could be on the horizon. Such development will undoubtedly provide a major boost for the crypto token, considering the impact that token burns have on a crypto’s value.  </p>
<h2>How More XRP Could Be Burned</h2>
<p>Zach Rector mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/ZachRector7/status/1777524969573884108" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> that there would be an XRP supply shock. He predicts that this will happen as more <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-burn-40-billion-xrp/">XRP is burned</a> with the creation of XRP bridges and an increase in XRP lockups. He also alluded to Decentralized Finance (DeFi) activity on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) as another that could increase the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/total-xrp-burn-crosses-6-8-million/">XRP burns</a>. </p>

<p>Rector made this statement while reacting to an <a href="https://x.com/realSologenic/status/1777447105017323693" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">update</a> from Sologenic, a tokenization platform on the XRP Ledger, in which they mentioned that over 1.6 million XRP have been bridged to the Cosmos ecosystem using the XRPL Coreum Bridge. Following Rector’s statement, another X user <a href="https://x.com/offledger/status/1777655058609365304" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">remarked</a> that there weren’t any added benefits to XRP being bridged to other blockchains.</p>
<p>This was in direct criticism of Rector’s statement, which suggested that creating more bridges could help increase XRP’s value. Meanwhile, another X user <a href="https://x.com/Papiliano_Z/status/1777572830814544175" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">suggested</a> that even if the 1.6 million XRP were burned, that is unlikely to significantly impact XRP’s price, considering the token’s circulating supply is over 55 billion XRP. </p>
<h2>XRP Is At A “Pivotal Moment”</h2>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=As0JfXhdaRU&amp;t=2s" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">video</a> posted on his YouTube channel, Rector mentioned that XRP was at a “pivotal moment” while highlighting several developments in the XRP ecosystem that could help increase the token’s adoption. These include <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-emerge-tether-upcoming-stablecoin-launch/">Ripple’s proposed launch</a> of its stablecoin on the XRPL and Ethereum networks. </p>
<p>As part of his analysis, Rector drew attention to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-ceo-speak-world-economic-forum-wef/#:~:text=In%20an%20interview%20with%20Financial,Ripple&#039;s%20presence%20at%20the%20WEF.">Ripple’s President Monica Lang’s</a> statement, in which she mentioned how issuing a stablecoin on XRPL and Ethereum will “unlock new opportunities for institutional and DeFi use cases across multiple ecosystems.” Specifically, Lang added that the stablecoin would help expand both XRPL and XRP’s utility. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Rector also alluded to the newly launched <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/ripple-amms-to-xrpl-xrp-price/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Automated Market Maker (AMM)</a> on the XRPL and liquidity bridges as other developments that present a bullish outlook for the XRP token. He believes they will help increase the crypto token’s adoption and utility. Having highlighted XRP’s bullish fundamentals, he again suggested that it was impossible for XRP to miss this bull run. </p>
<p>The crypto expert <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-is-primed-for-growth/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">previously mentioned</a> that XRP “will not miss this bull run” despite its current underperformance in the crypto market. Back then, he also highlighted the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-ceo-success-for-xrp/">crypto token’s fundamentals</a> as one of the reasons he holds this belief. </p>

<title>Solana &amp; Other Top Coins Lose Trading Volume, Market Interest Down?</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/solana-top-coins-lose-trading-volumet-interest/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/solana-top-coins-lose-trading-volumet-interest/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。<br />文章指出，最近Solana和其他顶级加密货币的交易量有所下降。数据显示自3月初以来，比特币、以太坊和Solana的交易量一直在下降。这可能表明市场整体对这些资产的兴趣降低，尤其是在3月中旬市场开始震荡走势后。尽管Solana在交易量上一直居于领先地位，但在市场整体兴趣下降的趋势下，交易量最终也下降了。预计一旦比特币、以太坊和其他顶级资产再次确立一致的方向，交易量将再次上升。Solana的价格在过去一周中下跌超过12%，目前仅为165美元。 <div>
<p>On-chain data shows Solana and other top cryptocurrencies have seen a decline in trading volume recently. Here&#8217;s what this says about the market.</p>
<h2>Solana, Bitcoin, And Ethereum Trading Volumes Have Declined Over Past Month</h2>
<p>According to data from the on-chain analytics firm <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1777788154445242588" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Santiment</a>, the cryptocurrency market&#8217;s trading volume has been declining since its peak in early March.</p>

<p>The &#8220;<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/litecoin-daily-trading-volume-plunges/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">trading volume</a>&#8221; here refers to the total amount of any given asset involved in trades on the various <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-spot-trading-volume-increase-in-three-months/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">spot cryptocurrency exchanges</a>.</p>
<p>When this metric&#8217;s value is high, it means that many coins are being shifted around on these platforms, suggesting that trading interest in the given asset is high right now.</p>
<p>On the other hand, low indicator values can imply that the cryptocurrency market is currently inactive. Such a trend may be a sign that general interest in the coin is currently low.</p>
<p>Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the trading volume for various top assets in the sector, like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Solana (SOL):</p>
<p><img alt="Solana Trading Volume" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="1759" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GKv0UoubYAInhEH?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096" width="2481" /></p>

<p>As displayed in the above graph, the trading volume across these top cryptocurrencies shot up in late February and continued to witness such values into the first days of March.</p>
<p>On March 6th, in particular, the indicator observed an especially pronounced peak. Since this high, though, the metric has been stuck in a gradual state of decline.</p>
<p>&#8220;This appears partly due to the ranging pattern that began in mid-March, causing less confidence in traders making the right decision,&#8221; explains the analytics firm.</p>
<p>Bitcoin has naturally occupied the largest trading volume share of all the assets, while Ethereum, the second-largest coin, has seen the second-greatest portion.</p>
<p>Interestingly, out of the altcoins, Solana has generally tended to stay number one despite the fact that BNB (BNB) has a greater market cap. For SOL, the peak in volume came a bit later than BTC and ETH, perhaps as a result of the coin continuing to see an uptrend while many others slumped down in mid-March.</p>

<p>However, the volume eventually sank for Solana, aligning with the trend followed by the other top assets. Thus, it would seem that the interest in the market as a whole has been on the downturn recently.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other top caps begin to establish a consistent direction once again, expect consistent trades to begin rising once again,&#8221; says Santiment.</p>
<h2>SOL Price</h2>
<p>The past week hasn&#8217;t been the best of times for Solana investors as the asset&#8217;s price has dropped more than 12% inside the window, taking its price to just $165.</p>

<title>Spot Bitcoin ETFs To Receive Green Light In Hong Kong This April</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etfs-to-receive-green-light-in-hong-kong/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etfs-to-receive-green-light-in-hong-kong/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。根据最新的路透社报道，香港即将成为亚洲第一个推出现货比特币ETF的城市。预计这些ETF的初步批准将在下周宣布，超出了今年此类推出的行业预期。此举是香港试图恢复其作为重要金融中心的地位的一部分，以吸引全球投资并推动加密货币的更广泛应用。同时，市场上领先的加密货币比特币近期经历了价格波动，取得了新的历史高点，但由于高位阻力，价格出现下降。 <div>
<p>According to a recent Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/hong-kong-set-approve-its-first-spot-bitcoin-etfs-april-sources-say-2024-04-10/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, Hong Kong is on the verge of becoming Asia&#8217;s first city to launch spot Bitcoin ETFs. Notably, the initial approvals for these ETFs are expected to be announced as early as next week, which is significantly ahead of industry expectations for such launches this year. </p>
<h2>Hong Kong&#8217;s Bid For Revival</h2>
<p>Per the report, the move to introduce spot Bitcoin ETFs comes as Hong Kong seeks to revive its status as a prominent financial center, in which pandemic-related restrictions have somewhat diminished, China&#8217;s economic slowdown, and tensions between China and the United States. </p>
<p>By embracing cryptocurrency<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cathie-wood-cheers-hong-kongs-crypto-web3-push/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> investment vehicles</a>, Hong Kong aims to attract fresh global investment and drive crypto adoption to new heights.</p>

<p>Adrian Wang, CEO of Hong Kong-based crypto wealth manager Metalpha, emphasized the significance of introducing Bitcoin ETFs in Hong Kong, pointing out the potential for increased <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-broadens-reach/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">global investment</a> and broader adoption of cryptocurrencies. </p>
<p>This move follows the success of the United States, which launched the first US-listed spot Bitcoin ETFs in January and attracted approximately $12 billion in net inflows, as previously <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etf-issuer-vaneck-dives-stablecoin-market/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">reported </a>by Bitcoinist.</p>
<p>While the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) and the three Chinese companies declined to comment on the matter, China Asset Management and Harvest Fund Management&#8217;s Hong Kong units have recently obtained <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etf-frenzy-reaches-china-as-top-funds-apply/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">approval </a>from the SFC to manage portfolios with investments exceeding 10% in virtual assets. </p>
<p>These parent companies are prominent mutual fund firms in China, each managing assets exceeding 1 trillion yuan ($138 billion).</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Futures Success Fuels Interest In Spot Bitcoin ETFs</h2>
<p>Cryptocurrency trading is <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bybit-faces-scrutiny-hong-kong-tags-crypto-exchange/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">prohibited </a>in mainland China. Nevertheless, offshore Chinese financial institutions have shown a keen interest in participating in developing crypto assets in Hong Kong. </p>
<p>The city had previously approved ETFs for cryptocurrency futures in late 2022, with the CSOP Bitcoin Futures ETF being the largest one. It has amassed around $120 million in <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-htx-retreats-hong-kong-license-withdrawal/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">assets under managemen</a>t, a sevenfold increase since September 2023.</p>
<p>In addition to the asset managers mentioned, Hong Kong-based Value Partners has expressed its exploration of launching a spot Bitcoin ETF, although it has not disclosed whether an official application has been submitted. </p>
<p>Furthermore, at least four mainland Chinese and Hong Kong asset managers, including China Asset Management, Harvest Fund Management, and Bosera Asset Management, have submitted applications to launch spot Bitcoin ETFs.</p>

<p>As the regulatory landscape evolves, the introduction of spot Bitcoin ETFs in Hong Kong is expected to pave the way for greater investment opportunities and contribute to the growth and maturation of the global cryptocurrency market.</p>
<img alt="Bitcoin ETFs" class="size-medium" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/wLYrCQL6/" width="1815" />
<p>At the time of writing, the leading cryptocurrency in the market has witnessed significant price volatility. It approached its current all-time high on Monday and reached a peak of $72,600. However, it encountered higher-level resistance, declining to the $67,600 range. This represents a 3.5% decrease over the past 24 hours alone.</p>

<title>Uniswap Labs Receives Wells Notice From SEC, Founder Vows To Fight Back</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/uniswap-labs-receives-wells-notice-from-sec/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/uniswap-labs-receives-wells-notice-from-sec/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。Uniswap Labs收到SEC的Wells通知，面临可能的执法行动，创始人Hayden Adams表示愤慨并决心与SEC对抗。他认为Uniswap的产品符合法律框架，批评SEC对待方式，强调区块链技术的潜力，认为DeFi社区可以取得胜利。 <div>
<p>In a significant development that highlights the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s (SEC) increasing regulatory actions against the cryptocurrency industry, Uniswap Labs, the software development company behind the Uniswap decentralized exchange (DEX), recently received a Wells Notice from the SEC. </p>
<p>A Wells notice is a formal communication issued by the US SEC to individuals or entities indicating that the SEC staff has completed their investigation and is considering recommending enforcement action against them.</p>
<h2>Uniswap Founder Challenges SEC</h2>
<p>Hayden Adams, the founder of Uniswap, took to X (formerly Twitter) to <a href="https://x.com/haydenzadams/status/1778126466984575166" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">share the news</a> with the community. While expressing his lack of surprise, Adams conveyed his annoyance and disappointment, along with a resolute determination to fight back against the SEC&#8217;s allegations. </p>
<p>Adams firmly believes that the products offered by Uniswap are in compliance with existing legal frameworks and that the company is on the right side of history.</p>

<p>Adams further criticized the SEC&#8217;s approach, noting that instead of creating clear and informed regulations, the focus seems to be on targeting reputable players in the industry such as Uniswap and Coinbase, while “letting bad actors like FTX slip by.” Adams furhter stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>The SEC’s mission is “protecting investors, maintaining fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitating capital formation.” This is a noble mission. I would argue Uniswap does a far better job of this today than the SEC.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Blockchain And Early Internet Days</h2>
<p>Despite the challenges faced, Adams emphasized the company&#8217;s commitment to the United States and its belief in the transformative potential of blockchain technology. </p>
<p>The founder of Uniswap Labs emphasized the need for responsible actors to lead the way in understanding and harnessing this powerful technology for the benefit of society, comparing it to the early days of the Internet. </p>

<p>Lastly, Adams acknowledged that the upcoming legal battle with the SEC will likely be protracted and may even reach the Supreme Court. However, Adams remains optimistic, believing that by standing together, the DeFi community can prevail. </p>

<title>Telegram’s Toncoin Flips Cardano Out Of Top 10, Is Dogecoin Next?</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/toncoin-flips-cardano-dogecoin/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/toncoin-flips-cardano-dogecoin/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />Telegram关联的加密代币TON最近超过了Cardano（ADA），成为市值第九大的加密代币。TON价格创新高，全年涨幅超过193％，并宣布在电报平台上推出TON支付。此外，电报还将启动广告收入共享计划，给频道所有者支付TON。此外，基于电报的游戏Notcoin将在月底在TON网络上推出代币，此举预计将推动TON生态系统的流动性增加。TON目前市值230亿美元，有望超越市值270亿美元的狗狗币，成为第八大加密代币。虽然TON价格表现强劲，但前100大持有者持有TON流通供应量的93.20％，可能对价格造成影响。 <div>
<p>Telegram-linked crypto token <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/toncoin-ton/toncoin-ton-hits-new-yearly-peaks-surging-60-on-buzz-surrounding-potential-telegram-ipo/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Toncoin (TON)</a> recently climbed above Cardano (ADA) to become the ninth-largest crypto token by market cap. TON’s explosive move and sustained bullish momentum have raised the possibility that it could soon flip <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-dogecoin-shib-excitement/">Dogecoin (DOGE)</a>, which currently occupies the eighth position. </p>
<h2>Toncoin Hits New All-Time High (ATH)</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/toncoin-ton/toncoin-ton-hits-new-yearly-peaks-surging-60-on-buzz-surrounding-potential-telegram-ipo/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Toncoin</a> hit a new all-time high (ATH) of $7 on its way to overtaking ADA in the crypto ranking by market cap. This recent move further highlights the crypto token’s impressive price action since the beginning of the year. TON currently boasts a year-to-date (YTD) gain of over 193% and has enjoyed the most gains among the top 10 crypto tokens. </p>

<p>TON’s current bullish momentum is believed to be due to several factors, including the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/toncoin-ton/telegram-implements-toncoin-payment-integration-for-ads-ton-price-sees-impact/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">recent integration</a> of TON payments into the messaging platform Telegram. Telegram boasts over 900 million active users, meaning that TON’s utility could quickly skyrocket as more users on the platform continue to gain interest in the crypto token. </p>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/telegram-launch-auction-for-usernames-on-network/">Telegram</a> also previously announced that it would kickstart an ad revenue-sharing program for channel owners, with payment made exclusively in TON. Telegram’s active promotion of the crypto token isn’t surprising, considering that Telegram’s founder Pavel Durov developed the original TON network, which was known as the ‘Telegram Open Network’ before it rebranded to The Open Network (TON).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, TON has also benefitted from the hype around the Telegram-based game Notcoin, which is set to launch its token on the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/animoca-brands-top-validator-position-ton-network/">TON network</a> later this month. This launch is also expected to drive liquidity into the TON ecosystem and increase the network’s adoption. For context, Notcoin has over 35 million players. </p>
<h2>Will Toncoin Flip Dogecoin?</h2>
<p>Toncoin currently boasts a market of over $23 billion compared to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-mirrors-2021-12/">DOGE’s market cap</a> of $27 billion. However, a significant price surge for TON could easily see the crypto token climb above the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-doge-price-can-reach-1/">foremost meme coin</a> to become the eighth-largest crypto token by market cap. Moreover, DOGE has had a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-stalls-at-0-2-doge/">tepid price action</a> lately and has shown little signs of making any parabolic move to the upside. </p>

<p>On the other hand, TON has continued to record remarkable gains despite the bearish sentiment plaguing the broader crypto market. Specifically, TON has <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-crypto-analyst-1900/#:~:text=If%20that%20happens%2C%20Ethereum%20could,its%20current%20price%20of%20%241%2C600." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">outperformed</a> DOGE in the last seven days, boasting a price gain of over 32% to DOGE’s gain of just 2%. </p>
<p>While TON’s price has shown incredible strength, it is worth noting that the crypto token’s tokenomics isn’t the most impressive. <a href="https://www.coincarp.com/currencies/toncoin/richlist/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Data</a> from CoinCarp shows that TON’s top 100 holders hold 93.20% of its circulating supply. This is undoubtedly a cause for concern as these whales could easily send TON’s price <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crash-10-69000/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">crashing down</a>.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, TON is trading at around $6.79, down in the last 24 hours, according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/toncoin/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">data</a> from CoinMarketCap.</p>
<p>  <img alt="Toncoin price chart from Tradingview.com (TON, Dogecoin, Cardano)" class="aligncenter size-medium" height="1530" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/e9sKECTh/" width="3286" /></p>

<title>US CPI Comes In Hot: What This Means For Bitcoin And Crypto</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。美国最新公布的消费者价格指数（CPI）数据超出预期，显示通胀趋势强劲，可能会显著影响美联储未来的货币政策决策。比特币和加密货币市场迅速下跌，市场对利率预期有所下降。交易员显示美联储在未来维持利率不变的可能性很高。对于比特币和加密市场，通货膨胀上升和利率下降对加密货币不利，但也有观点认为当前市场状况可能有利于长期的加密货币发展。BTC目前交易于68277美元。 <div>
<p>The latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures released by the United States have exceeded expectations, signaling a robust inflationary trend that could significantly influence the Federal Reserve&#8217;s forthcoming monetary policy decisions. The Bitcoin and crypto markets reacted with a swift downtrend. The BTC price initially dropped by 2.7%, falling below $67,200. Altcoins have reacted even more strongly to the data.</p>
<p>The non-seasonally adjusted CPI for March 2024 soared to an annual rate of 3.5%, surpassing both the anticipated figure of 3.4% and February&#8217;s rate of 3.2%, marking the highest inflation rate since September 2023. This uptick reflects not just a transient economic fluctuation but a deeper, more sustained<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-btc-leading-indicator-cpi-inflation/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> inflationary pressure</a> within the economy.</p>

<p>The details of the CPI report reveal that both the headline and core inflation rates, which exclude volatile food and energy prices, increased by 0.4% month-over-month. This uniform rise underscores a pervasive inflationary pressure across various sectors, not limited to volatile categories. The year-over-year core CPI maintained its pace at 3.8%, slightly ahead of market forecasts and unchanged from February, indicating that underlying inflation pressures remain persistent.</p>

<p></p>
<h2>Market Reactions And Federal Reserve&#8217;s Dilemma</h2>
<p>The market&#8217;s response to these figures was swift, with immediate implications for interest rate expectations. The swaps market, a reliable gauge of monetary policy expectations, showed a decreased likelihood of the Federal Reserve <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/federal-reserve-rate-cut-will-benefit-bitcoin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">cutting interest rates</a> in the near future. According to CME Group&#8217;s FedWatch tool, the probability that rates will remain unchanged at the Fed&#8217;s May meeting is now at 94.1%, with a 81.3% chance of holding steady through June.</p>

<p>Mohamed A. El-Erian, offering his perspective, <a href="https://twitter.com/elerianm/status/1778048231097704793" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">stated</a>, &#8220;The market is now pricing less than two Federal Reserve cuts this year as it takes another step in the &#8220;later and fewer&#8221; direction for the excessively dependent Fed. The major stock futures indices are down over 1%, and the dollar is stronger. All this puts the Fed in quite a tricky position &#8212; one in which it should take a holistic view of what&#8217;s ahead for the economy as a whole. But will it?”</p>

<p>Christopher Inks sought to temper reactions by reminding the public of the Fed&#8217;s preference for the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index as its primary inflation measure.</p>
<p>“Since we are seeing people replying about what the Fed is going to do re: rate cuts as a result of the CPI release this morning, I will once again remind you that the Fed stopped focusing on the CPI about a decade ago. It&#8217;s preferred inflation gauge is the PCE which comes out at the end of the month,” Inks <a href="https://twitter.com/TXWestCapital/status/1778045618235040104" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">explained</a>.</p>
<h2>Implications For Bitcoin And The Crypto Market</h2>
<p>The crypto market has been closely watching the data. Charles Edwards pointed out the adverse effects of rising inflation and decreasing <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-halving-overrated-liquidity-cycle/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">liquidity</a> on cryptocurrencies, <a href="https://twitter.com/caprioleio/status/1778046513257808347" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">stating</a>, &#8220;Inflation rising again and more than expected. Likely related [to] why we saw liquidity start to fall the last weeks also. Not good for crypto if these two trends continue.”</p>
<p>Matt Hougan (CIO of Bitwise) and Dave Weisberger (Chairman of CoinRoutes) offered a contrary <a href="https://twitter.com/Matt_Hougan/status/1778048008384295139" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">view</a>, suggesting that current market conditions may actually favor cryptocurrencies in the long run. Hougan noted, &#8220;Whether the Fed cut rates 25bps in June or not isn&#8217;t the long-term driver of Bitcoin prices right now. It&#8217;s a marginal factor. ETF flows + rising deficits matter more, and they are lining up very well for Bitcoin.”</p>
<p>Weisberger, sharing Hougan&#8217;s optimism, added, “Agreed. My contrarian take is this is a buying opportunity as these numbers show the strongest cracks in the dollar hegemonic <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/robert-kiyosaki-champions-crypto/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">FIAT experiment</a> yet… Gold, for the moment, is getting it right and Bitcoin will inevitably react. (In the meantime, the whale playbook of pushing the market down to buy cheaper is still alive…).”</p>
<p>At press time, BTC traded at $68,277.</p>

<title>Why Is The Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Price Swimming In Red Today?</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-shiba-inu-price-red/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-shiba-inu-price-red/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。加密市场整体经历了血洗，导致Dogecoin和Shiba Inu的价值下跌5％。市场跟随比特币下降，导致快速波动的热门热门加密货币遭受损失。投资者担心这种价格下跌的原因，可能是由于美国通胀数据和比特币减半事件推动的。 Dogecoin和Shiba Inu的价格下降也受到比特币价格下跌的影响。随着比特币价格预计将下跌，投资者转向风险资产，导致市场的不稳定性。 <div>
<p class="p2">The entirety of the crypto market is experiencing a bloodbath right now after the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-huge-discount-pre-halving-dip-buy/">Bitcoin price dumped below $70,000</a> and Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are not left out. Both <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-doge-sights-on-0-3/">meme coins</a> have seen their values tumble by at least 5% in the last day alone, leaving investors to wonder what could be behind this price decline.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Fall 5%</h2>
<p class="p2">A consequence of the crypto market closely trailing the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-key-events-this-week/">Bitcoin price</a> is the fact that when the premier cryptocurrency does begin falling, it takes the market down with it. It is also no surprise that during these times, meme coins have suffered some of the biggest losses, as they are infamous for their high volatility and wild price fluctuations.</p>

<p class="p2">Given this, despite the fact that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/federal-reserve-rate-cut-will-benefit-bitcoin/">Bitcoin</a> has only seen a less than 2% decline in the last day, and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-whistleblower-sues-us-govt-9-6-billion/">Ethereum</a> came in at a less than 3% loss, meme coins Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have notched losses of up to 5% in the same time period.</p>
<p class="p2">The Dogecoin price had been trending above $0.2 before the crash and ended up falling briefly below $019. In the same vein, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-major-exchange-listing/">Shiba Inu price</a> reached above $0.000029, but the price crash sent it tumbling below $0.000027 before reclaiming $0.000027 once again, with bulls aiming to establish support at this level.</p>
<p class="p2">Sentiment in both camps of these <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-doge-sights-on-0-3/">meme coins</a> has also suffered tremendously as fear of another extended bearish streak plagues the community. The decline is more noticeable in the Shiba Inu metrics as its daily trading volume has seen a significant 17% slump in the last day. In comparison, Dogecoin has fared better, still seeing meager gains of 0.4% in its daily trading volume, according to data from Coinmarketcap.</p>
<h2 class="p2">What’s Driving The Decline?</h2>
<p class="p2">As mentioned above, the decline in the Dogecoin and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-692-billion-shib/">Shiba Inu price</a>, as well as the broader cryptocurrency market decline, is being driven by the fall in the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bulls-beware-deutsche-bank-survey-sparks/">Bitcoin price</a>. So, to know what is causing the fall in Dogecoin and Shiba Inu means to find out why the Bitcoin price tumbled in the first place.</p>

<p class="p2">One prominent factor driving the decline in price is the US inflation data. Over the past few months, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-inflation-puts-the-squeeze-on-food-chains/">inflation data has come in poorer than expected</a>, and with a 75 basis point (bps) rate cut expected later this year, investors are recoiling from risk assets such as Bitcoin.</p>
<p class="p2">Another driver is the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-key-events-this-week/">expectation of a pre-halving crash</a>. In the past, the Bitcoin price has seen a 20-30% decline in the price leading up to the halving event, and investors expect a repeat of this trend. However, with Bitcoin deviating from this trend, such as hitting a new all-time high before a halving event for the first time in history, the accuracy of this prediction is being called into question.</p>

<title>Decoding Ripple: CTO Delivers Clarity Surrounding Firm’s Identity And XRP</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-cto-clarity-on-firms-identity-and-xrp/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-cto-clarity-on-firms-identity-and-xrp/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章讨论了关于Ripple和XRP身份的争议，Ripple的首席技术官David "JoelKatz" Schwartz强调了公司努力在两者之间提供明晰区分。XRP曾被称为“ripples”，导致两者常被混淆。一场关于Ripple和XRP命名争议的讨论由一位澳大利亚律师引发，公司表示他们无法预测这种混淆将导致未来问题。区分Ripple和XRP是成功导航加密货币市场的关键。 <div>
<p>Amid a contentious discussion regarding Ripple and XRP identity, the firm&#8217;s Chief Technology Officer (CTO) David &#8220;JoelKatz&#8221; Schwartz has provided <a href="https://x.com/JoelKatz/status/1777525256036454526" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">insights</a> on the subject, emphasizing the company&#8217;s effort to provide clarity between both parties.</p>
<h2>Ripple CTO On Naming Controversy</h2>
<p>Both XRP and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-emerge-tether-upcoming-stablecoin-launch/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ripple</a> have similar pasts; XRP was once known as &#8220;ripples&#8221; before taking on its current configuration. Due to this, both parties are sometimes mistaken as one, leading to constant confusion within the entire cryptocurrency community over time.</p>

<p>Initially, the recent debate around the company&#8217;s and XRP naming which originated from the X (formerly Twitter) platform was triggered by popular Australlian-based attorney <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/secs-primary-target-is-crypto-status-not-xrp/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bill Morgan</a>. The lawyer brought the community&#8217;s attention to a situation where the Australian Crypto Convention&#8217;s website mislabeled XRP as Ripple.</p>
<p>&#8220;The good old Australian exchange that still wrongly equates Ripple with XRP. Sad after all these years,&#8221; he stated. Morgan&#8217;s post was accompanied by a screenshot providing clarity on the difference between Ripple and XRP.</p>
<p>Expressing displeasure, a user commented saying Morgan is ignorant of the past, as XRP was referred to as Ripples prior to the 2017 bull run, urging the lawyer to review past news articles to know what they called them. However, Morgan concurred with the user highlighting that the problem is that both entities are 7 years out of date.</p>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-cto-clarity-on-xrp-ledgers-genesis-block/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">David Schwartz</a> weighed in on the matter after another user blamed the payment firm for the controversy over the years. According to Schwartz, the company had no way of predicting that the outcome would lead to confusion in the future.</p>
<p>This is because private blockchains and initial coin offerings (ICOs) had not yet been introduced when they came up with the names of the entities. However, the firm made every effort to encourage the community to acknowledge the differences.</p>
<p>Nik Bougalis, the company&#8217;s former Director of Engineering, also shared his insights on the subject. In his commentary, Bougalis claimed that the firm&#8217;s unilateral adoption of the name &#8220;Ripple&#8221; from the network and protocol was the cause of the naming dispute. Thus, he asserts that it was an egregiously poor choice of name with well-defined long-term consequences.</p>
<h2>Distinction Between The Company And XRP</h2>
<p>Knowing the difference between the two bodies is essential for anyone trying to navigate the cryptocurrency market successfully. This way, crypto enthusiasts can more fully recognize the distinct contributions that each has made to the larger crypto landscape by making a distinction between both parties.</p>

<p>It is important to note that Ripple is a money transfer network created to meet the demands of the financial services sector, and XRP functions as the native utility token of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-2-major-technical-advances-xrp-ledger/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">XRP Ledger (XRPL)</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-wont-make-you-rich/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">XRP</a> has a more direct role in facilitating transactions on the blockchain, whereas Ripple&#8217;s technology suite is intended to be embraced by financial institutions for better payment processing and settlements.</p>

<title>Bitcoin ETF Outflows Nearing Equilibrium, Says Grayscale Chief</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etf-outflows-equilibrium-grayscale/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etf-outflows-equilibrium-grayscale/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。Grayscale Bitcoin Trust（GBTC）在经历了大幅资金流出后，似乎正接近关键的平衡点。Grayscale CEO Michael Sonnenshein指出，资金流出已经达到平衡点，预计未来将进一步稳定。尽管日常资金流出仍然为负数，但趋势明显地在向转变，显示出日流出已从三月的峰值水平下降。此外，Grayscale可能会降低费用以保持竞争力。最新数据显示，GBTC持有超过323,209K BTC，价值约22.29亿美元。BTC最新价格为68,840美元。 <div>
<p>The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) appears to be approaching a critical balance point after a period of significant outflows, according to Michael Sonnenshein, CEO of Grayscale Investments. In an exclusive <a href="https://twitter.com/hoss_crypto/status/1777992590521999653" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">interview</a> with Reuters on the latest episode of Inside ETFs, Sonnenshein delved into the challenges and transformations faced by the GBTC.</p>
<p>Grayscale Investments has been at the forefront of the crypto asset management sector since 2013. The firm encountered heightened competition as the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/breaking-spot-bitcoin-etfs-approved-by-us-sec/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">greenlit</a> spot Bitcoin ETF products from nine other issuers on January 11, ending a prolonged standoff with the crypto industry. This regulatory milestone opened the gates for a variety of investment products, putting <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etf-fee-war-grayscale-ceo-says-gbtc-fees-will-drop-over-time/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Grayscale&#8217;s dominance</a> to the test.</p>
<h2>Grayscale Bitcoin Outflows Coming To An End?</h2>
<p>GBTC experienced over $15 billion in outflows in three months. Nonetheless, the appreciating value of Bitcoin has cushioned Grayscale&#8217;s assets under management (AUM), which have slightly dipped to $23.13 billion.</p>

<p>Addressing this, Sonnenshein remarked, &#8220;We do believe that the fund has started to reach a little bit of an equilibrium where some of those anticipated outflows, whether it was some of the bankruptcy selling, some investors perhaps undertaking switch trades, (are) largely behind us.&#8221;</p>
<p>A portion of the outflows Grayscale faced can be traced back to the aftermath of bankruptcy filings by several crypto firms in 2022 and 2023, which held GBTC shares on their balance sheets.</p>
<p>The conversion of our trust to an ETF was a significant transition that played into the hands of various stakeholders, including those looking to settle bankruptcy like <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-sheds-nearly-1-billion-in-grayscale-bitcoin-etf/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">FTX</a> and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/next-bitcoin-crash-genesis-1-5-billion-gbtc-sale/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Genesis</a> claims. This has understandably led to a temporary surge in outflows, which is now showing signs of abating.</p>
<p>The Grayscale CEO also highlighted the shift in investor behavior, noting a trend of switch trades where investors sold off GBTC only to reinvest in other Bitcoin ETFs. This strategy is driven by the much lower fees of competitors like BlackRock, Fidelity and Bitwise, among others.</p>
<p>Despite the daily outflows remaining in negative territory, with Farside Investors noting a $303.3 million outflow on Monday and a $154.9 million outflow on Tuesday, the trend is evidently shifting from the peaks seen in March, where daily outflows were around $600 million.</p>

<p>Sonnenshein also expressed his optimism about Grayscale&#8217;s role and future in the ecosystem. &#8220;As we look ahead, again, it&#8217;s more about bringing more investors into the ecosystem (and) continuing to innovate on the product front,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In response to emerging competition from giants like BlackRock and Fidelity, which have launched their own Bitcoin ETFs with significantly lower fees and rapidly attracted substantial assets, Sonnenshein suggested that Grayscale might lower fees to remain competitive. &#8220;Over time, as markets mature, we anticipate that GBTC&#8217;s fees will come down,&#8221; Sonnenshein said.</p>
<p>According to the latest data from Arkham Intelligence, GBTC holds over 323,209K BTC, which is valued at approximately $22.29 billion. This marks a significant decrease from the over 618,000 BTC it started with at the beginning of the year, illustrating the scale and impact of the outflows the trust has experienced.</p>
<p>At press time, BTC traded at $68,840.</p>

<title>Secret Weapon For Bitcoin? This Level Could Unlock A Historic Rally, Analyst Says</title>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。比特币价格接近历史最高值，即将迎来减半事件，这被认为可能推动价格上涨。历史上，比特币减半事件通常与价格上涨相关。技术指标显示乐观态势，但仍存在不确定性。除减半外，机构投资、全球经济状况和加密货币生态系统发展也将影响长期发展。在未来的几周和几个月中，比特币将面临重要挑战。 <div>
<p>The cryptocurrency world is abuzz with anticipation as Bitcoin (BTC) trades near its all-time high, inching closer to a potential record-breaking run. This bullish sentiment comes on the heels of a significant price surge in March, which saw BTC peak at $73,805. However, analysts believe the best may be yet to come, with the highly anticipated Bitcoin halving event just around the corner.</p>

<h2><strong>Bitcoin Halving: A Catalyst for Price Rise?</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-analyst-sees-100k-before-halving/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin halvings</a> are pivotal events in the cryptocurrency&#8217;s ecosystem, occurring approximately every four years. These events are programmed into the cryptocurrency&#8217;s protocol and serve to reduce the rate at which new coins are created.</p>
<p>The mechanism behind halvings involves cutting the rewards for miners who validate transactions on the Bitcoin network in half. This reduction effectively decreases the supply of new coins entering circulation, leading to a potential increase in scarcity.</p>
<p>Historically, Bitcoin halvings have been associated with significant price appreciation. This phenomenon is rooted in the basic principles of supply and demand economics. As the issuance rate of new BTC decreases, the available supply diminishes, while demand remains constant or may even increase. This scarcity tends to drive up the price of Bitcoin as investors and traders anticipate future scarcity-driven value appreciation.</p>
<h2><strong>Technical Indicators Paint Bullish Picture</strong></h2>
<p>Adding fuel to the fire are bullish technical indicators. Despite a slight dip in price over the past 24 hours, Bitcoin remains firmly above the critical $69,000 level identified by prominent crypto analyst Michaël van de Poppe as crucial for a potential test of the all-time high. Moreover, trading volume has surged nearly 20% in the last day, signifying heightened activity and strong investor interest in the market.</p>

<strong>Uncertainties Remain Despite Optimism</strong>
<p>While the outlook for Bitcoin appears bright in the short term, cryptocurrency markets are notoriously volatile. Unforeseen events, regulatory changes, or broader economic factors can all lead to sudden price swings. Additionally, the long-term impact of the halving on price remains to be seen.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="571" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/KOugE3yi/" width="1281" /></p>

<strong>Beyond The Halving: Long-Term Considerations</strong>
<p>Looking beyond the immediate halving event, several factors will continue to shape <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-will-hit-150000-by-2025-ceo/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin&#8217;s price trajectory</a>. These include institutional adoption, the overall health of the global economy, and the ongoing development of the cryptocurrency ecosystem.</p>
<p>Increased institutional investment, for example, could provide a significant boost to the leading crypto asset&#8217;s legitimacy and stability. Conversely, an economic downturn or regulatory crackdowns could dampen investor sentiment and lead to price corrections.</p>

<strong>A Balancing Act</strong>
<p>The coming weeks and months will be crucial for Bitcoin as it navigates the upcoming halving and its potential impact on price. While the short-term outlook appears optimistic, long-term success will depend on a delicate balance of various factors.</p>

<title>Ethereum Whistleblower Sues US Govt For $9.6 Billion In FTCA Case</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。<br />史蒂芬·尼雷约夫，前以太坊网络顾问，对美国政府提起了96亿美元的诉讼，指控虚假起诉和其他严重指控。诉讼声称美国政府在2019年至2023年期间向尼雷约夫施加虚假指控，包括骚扰、恐吓和胁迫，同时损害了他的声誉和生意。迈克尔·斯科托和阿兰·德肖维茨等知名律师参与此案，指控联邦法律执法部门在加密货币案件中滥用职权，强调尼雷约夫案件可能改变行业内的做法。以太坊价格目前为3534美元。 <div>
<p>On Tuesday, Steven Nerayoff, a former advisor to the Ethereum network, filed a lawsuit against the US government, seeking $9.6 billion in damages. The lawsuit, filed under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), accuses the government of false prosecution and a series of other serious allegations spanning from 2019 to 2023.</p>
<h2>Ethereum Insider Vs. The US Govt</h2>
<p>Nerayoff&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/StevenNerayoff/status/1777691121595863248" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> of the lawsuit came through a post on X (formerly Twitter), where he vehemently expressed, &#8220;Today I have filed my Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) lawsuit suing the US government for personal damages related to false prosecution. It is time we took a stand against this unrestrained corruption, for all the people wrongly accused &amp; to ensure justice against those who have been a part of this.&#8221;</p>

<p>He extended his thanks to Eleanor Terrett of Fox Business for publicizing the lawsuit, as well as his lawyer Michael Scotto and others involved in bringing the case to attention. Terrett, through her post on X, elaborated on the lawsuit, explaining that the former Ethereum advisor and his legal team have filed an FTCA lawsuit suing the US government for $9.6 billion in personal damages stemming from false charges and alleged mistreatment by federal agents between 2019 and 2023.</p>
<p>The lawsuit alleges that certain federal agents were cognizant of the groundless nature of the charges against Nerayoff and engaged in harassment, intimidation, and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-insider-fbi-sec-corruption-insights/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">evidence fabrication</a> to prosecute him under the Hobbs Act for extortion. Despite the dismissal of the federal indictment against Nerayoff &#8220;with prejudice&#8221; in May 2023, the legal documents argue that the damage to Nerayoff&#8217;s reputation and businesses justifies the substantial claim for damages.</p>
<p>The involvement of former Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Michael Scotto and renowned lawyer Alan Dershowitz as a constitutional consultant adds significant weight to the case. Dershowitz highlighted the exceptional nature of Nerayoff&#8217;s situation, &#8220;I am strongly opposed to prosecutors targeting individuals, which is why I agreed to serve as a constitutional consultant to Mr. Nerayoff.&#8221;</p>

<p>The detailed lawsuit documents provide a chilling narrative of alleged abuses of power by federal agents and officers, including physical assault, false arrest, unlawful detention, and malicious prosecution. Notably, the documents reference a comment by an Assistant United States Attorney (AUSA) that the federal government was willing to &#8220;eat a shit sandwich&#8221; — a metaphor for the government&#8217;s purported willingness to cover up wrongful, negligent, and unconstitutional actions to maintain the illusion of legitimate law enforcement in the crypto space.</p>
<p>&#8220;The federal government was willing to &#8216;eat a shit sandwich,&#8217; and ignore the federal agents and/or officers’ unconstitutional, unauthorized actions in order to maintain the public appearance that DOJ and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-insider-sec-completely-rogue/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">SEC were engaged</a> in legitimate, well-informed, sexy law enforcement actions in the crypto space…,” Nerayoff and his legal team claim.</p>
<p>Moreover, the lawsuit accuses federal prosecutors, agents, and officers of prioritizing their personal reputations and career prospects over justice, at the expense of Nerayoff&#8217;s constitutional rights and livelihood. &#8220;Such collateral damage was outweighed by federal prosecutors, agents and officers’ shared desires to build their own reputations and resumes in the cryptocurrency landscape, and in the lucrative private sectors,&#8221; the lawsuit alleges.</p>
<p>These accusations suggest a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-insider-ripple-lawsuit-part-bigger-plan/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">systemic issue</a> within federal law enforcement&#8217;s handling of cryptocurrency cases, with Nerayoff&#8217;s experience serving as a potential watershed moment for others in the industry. The lawsuit alleges, &#8220;By eating that &#8216;shit sandwich&#8217; federal prosecutors, agents and officers ignored how they were violating Mr. Nerayoff’s constitutional rights and destroying his life under color of law.&#8221;</p>
<p>At press time, the Ethereum price stood at $3,534.</p>

<title>Filecoin’s Liquid Staking Team Under Chinese Police Investigation, Where Are The Protocol’s Tokens?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。<br />周二，STFIL，一个Filecoin（FIL）的流动质押平台，宣布其团队据称正在接受中国当地警方的调查。该平台的FIL代币已被转移到团队控制之外的不明地址。警方怀疑参与人员被拘留，导致2.56万枚FIL代币价值约2300万美元被转移。Filecoin基金会已介入调查。STFIL项目也在发现多次不明的升级活动后要求社区监控未知地址。FilOZ团队成员警告用户提取他们的代币，以防止潜在危险。愿意解决问题并帮助FIL投资者。 <div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, STFIL, a liquid staking platform for Filecoin (FIL), announced that its team is allegedly under investigation by local Chinese police. The platform’s FIL tokens had been moved to an unknown address outside the team’s control.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The incident, now being investigated by the Filecoin Foundation, raised many concerns as investors wonder about the fate of their staked FIL tokens.</p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Is Chinese Police Behind The Missing Tokens?</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The STFIL Protocol announced on X their suspicion of being under investigation by local Chinese <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-trading-gone-wrong-teens-arrested-beating-19/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">police</a>. According to the post, the protocol’s team believes the core technical team is being investigated after they were detained last week.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">We believe that the STFIL core technical team is under investigation by local Chinese police, and we understand lawyers have been hired to understand the current situation and provide legal assistance to the individuals under detention.</p>
<p>Last week, when the core technical team…</p>
<p>&mdash; STFIL Protocol <img alt="🏔" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f3d4.png" style="height: 1em;" /> (@stfil_io) <a href="https://twitter.com/stfil_io/status/1777560493017686264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">April 9, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">During the detention, the FIL tokens staked in the STFIL platform were allegedly moved without the team’s authorization to an “unknown, external address.”  The mysterious address now holds 2.56 million FIL, worth around $23 million.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On April 7, a member of FilOZ, Filecoin’s independent public goods developers’ team, <a href="https://twitter.com/_jennijuju/status/1776851518051795077" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">revealed</a> that the community had contacted them over &#8220;STFIL Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM) Smart contract activities.&#8221;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The developer alerted users of the suspicious activity in the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/hong-kong-regulator-flags-floki-staking-products/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">staking protocol</a>. The FilOZ member warned of an unknown upgrade scheduled for the contract, which “could be concerning.” Additionally, she urged lenders to consider withdrawing their tokens before the upgrade.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">STFIL confirmed the reports on their X post. The team informed that the protocol had undergone several “abnormal, unscheduled upgrades” during the past few days.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the protocol sought the community’s assistance to monitor the unknown address and “discuss ways to protect” the stakeholders’ interests.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The announcement has raised concerns, as lenders now worry about their tokens and ways to retrieve them. Many Filecoin users are questioning the suspicious activity, <a href="https://twitter.com/Saigonbyh/status/1777583561693937814" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">wondering</a> why the protocol’s team didn’t inform sooner of their detainment or the unauthorized activity.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p></p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Filecoin Foundation Steps In</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The STFIL lenders asked the Filecoin Foundation to step in. Many <a href="https://x.com/Yangwen27366410/status/1777565470352380022" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">considered</a> that the incident’s gravity required the Filecoin team&#8217;s assistance to resolve the issue and help FIL investors.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">At first, the organization <a href="https://twitter.com/FilFoundation/status/1777649042404630849" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">approached</a> the situation by seemingly distancing themselves from the project. It first announced on an X post a “reshare of an important message” from an “independent third-party operating in the Filecoin ecosystem.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Users quickly showed their <a href="https://x.com/deen65297340/status/1777655531169038815" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">disappointment</a> with the foundation’s stance. The community highlighted STFIL’s importance in the Filecoin ecosystem. In the replies, several FIL users claimed to have staked their savings in the staking platform.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">UPDATE: Filecoin Foundation is tracking and evaluating the situation involving <a href="https://twitter.com/stfil_io?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">@stFIL_io</a>.

<p></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In a later update, the organization informed that they are now tracking and evaluating the situation. As a result, the coordinators postponed the scheduled nv22 network upgrade to April 24.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In response to the critics, the Filecoin Foundation affirmed that supporting the “overall health and syces of the network and all of its participants” remains its priority. At the time of this writing, the stolen tokens remain in the unauthorized address, and no recovery plan has been unveiled.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Demand Outpacing Miner Issuance To Unprecedented Degree: Data</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-demand-miner-issuance-unprecedented-degree/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-demand-miner-issuance-unprecedented-degree/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />在链上数据显示，比特币的持有者需求目前首次超过矿工发行量，这是史无前例的。持续删除比特币的“永久持有者”展示了这一需求增长的趋势。与此同时，比特币挖矿发行量的数据也被列入相同的图表中。最近，持有者的需求远远超过矿工的发行量，表明比特币需求之强。当前比特币价格约为68400美元，过去一周上涨超过4%。 <div>
<p>On-chain data shows that demand for Bitcoin from HODLers is currently outpacing miner issuance for the first time in history and by quite a lot.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Demand From Accumulation Addresses Is Higher Than Miner Issuance</h2>
<p>As CryptoQuant head of research Julio Moreno explained in a new <a href="https://twitter.com/jjcmoreno/status/1777537392036966485" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, the demand for the asset has recently been growing at an unprecedented rate. Below is the chart shared by the analyst showing the demand from the &#8220;permanent holders.&#8221;</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Miner Issuance &amp; HODLer Demand" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="1406" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GKsT61YWUAAYPwp?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096" width="2234" /></p>

<p>The &#8220;permanent holders&#8221; here refer to the owners of the &#8220;<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bullish-accumulation-addresses-buying-big/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">accumulation addresses</a>,&#8221; which are defined as wallets that have only a history of buying BTC and never of selling it.</p>

<p>Since these investors aren&#8217;t known to sell, it&#8217;s possible that the new supply that they accumulate would also become similarly illiquid in the future. As such, buying from these HODLers, in particular, can be a bullish sign, as it suggests the available trading supply of the asset is potentially going down.</p>
<p>In the chart, the demand from these HODLers is gauged using the growth in their combined balance. As is apparent, the accumulation addresses significantly upped their buying back in 2020 and maintained these growth levels for the next few years.</p>
<p>Moreno has also attached the Bitcoin &#8220;miner issuance&#8221; data to the same chart. This metric keeps track of the total amount of Bitcoin that the miners are minting on the network.</p>
<p>Miners &#8220;produce&#8221; BTC when they solve blocks and receive block rewards. These rewards are handed out in BTC and are the only way to increase the cryptocurrency&#8217;s circulating supply.</p>
<p>As the graph shows, the issuance observes streaks of a few years where it remains more or less constant. In between these streaks, its value suddenly plunges. The reason for this is naturally the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-huge-discount-pre-halving-dip-buy/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">halving</a>.</p>
<p>The halving is a periodic event on the Bitcoin network where the block rewards are permanently slashed in half. These events occur roughly every four years; the next one is scheduled in about ten days.</p>
<p>As displayed in the chart, while the demand from the accumulation addresses was quite high starting in 2020, it never quite exceeded the issuance of the miners.</p>

<p>Recently, however, the growth in the accumulation addresses has exploded, with the metric not only sustaining above the network issuance but also far surpassing its value.</p>
<p>This implies that these HODLers are buying much more than the miners have produced on the network. The CryptoQuant head notes that this is naturally only a portion of the total demand of the network, as there are other buyer entities, so it shows just how strong the demand for BTC has been recently.</p>
<p>A major driver behind this demand would be the emergence of the Bitcoin <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/who-will-go-first-morgan-stanley-salty-as-ubs-joins-the-bitcoin-etf-race/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs)</a>, which provide an alternative way to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency in a mode that&#8217;s preferable for traditional investors.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $68,400, up more than 4% over the past week.</p>

<title>Spot Ethereum ETFs Unlikely Get SEC Approval, Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund Issuers Warn</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/spot-ethereum-etfs-unlikely-get-sec-approval/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/spot-ethereum-etfs-unlikely-get-sec-approval/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。根据CNBC的报道，发行商对SEC批准类似以太坊的现货交易基金表示怀疑。SEC主席Gary Gensler强调加密资产受联邦证券法管辖，这给以太坊ETF的批准带来了更多困难。证明占比协议使得以太坊ETF的批准面临挑战，也造成市场参与者和发行商对ETF批准的前景感到不确定。ETH的价格为$3,518，在过去24小时内下跌了2.5%。 <div>
<p>According to a CNBC report, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) issuers have expressed skepticism that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve similar spot Ethereum ETFs. </p>
<p>Market participants, including asset managers BlackRock, Fidelity, and VanEck, eagerly await approval for Ethereum <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-etfs-approval-odds-drop-to-35/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">ETF products</a>, but some issuers are uncertain about the SEC&#8217;s green light.</p>
<h2>Uncertainty Looms For Ethereum ETFs</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/09/bitcoin-etf-issuers-sec-wont-approve-ether-eth-exchange-traded-fund-.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">report </a>notes that SEC Chairman Gary Gensler&#8217;s emphasis on crypto assets subject to federal securities laws has further complicated matters for an Ethereum ETF. Gensler has asserted that most crypto assets are investment contracts, consistent with the SEC&#8217;s perspective. </p>

<p>Interestingly, VanEck CEO Jan Van Eck anticipates a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/approval-denial-ethereum-etf-sell-the-news-event/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">rejection </a>of their Ethereum ETF application, stating that regulators have been providing comments on the application for weeks. </p>
<p>Van Eck believes that the SEC&#8217;s decision-making process is similar to that of Bitcoin ETFs, where prolonged reviews eventually lead to approval. However, the outlook for Ethereum ETFs remains uncertain. VanEck CEO further noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>We were the first to file as well for Ethereum in the U.S., and we and [Ark Invest CEO] Cathy Wood, are kind of the first in line for May, I guess, to probably be rejected</p></blockquote>
<p>CoinShares CEO Jean-Marie Mognetti shares this pessimism, stating that he doesn&#8217;t foresee any approvals shortly, especially for proof of stake protocols specific to Ethereum.</p>
<h2>Proof Of Stake Protocol Complicates SEC Decision? </h2>
<p>The SEC&#8217;s acceptance of proof of work (PoW), the protocol underlying Bitcoin, has not raised securities law concerns the largest cryptocurrency has been <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2022/06/27/sec-chair-gary-gensler-discusses-potential-crypto-regulation-and-stablecoins.html?&amp;qsearchterm=gary%20gensler" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">deemed a commodity</a> by US regulators led by Gensler. </p>
<p>However, the proof of stake (PoS) that is central to Ethereum poses a challenge to the approval of Ethereum ETFs, which, as Bitcoin has continuously witnessed, opens the door for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/spot-ethereum-etf-delay-is-a-good-thing/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">traditional financial institutions</a> to increase adoption and offer these products to a greater number of investors in the US. </p>
<p>While Bitcoin relies on volunteer miners to validate transactions and create new tokens, Ethereum&#8217;s <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-etf-showdown-hong-kong-plans-to-launch-first-overtaking-the-us/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">proof of stake protocol</a> is based on participants staking their existing tokens to secure the network. </p>
<p>The SEC&#8217;s reservations about this protocol are another obstacle to the approval of the Ethereum ETFs, as highlighted by CoinShare&#8217;s CEO, who further stated, &#8220;I don&#8217;t see anything getting approved this side of the year.&#8221; </p>

<p>Ultimately, market participants are eagerly awaiting the SEC&#8217;s decision on whether to approve or disapprove Ethereum ETFs, while issuers of spot Bitcoin ETFs are preparing for the outcome and navigating the regulatory landscape to offer investment products tied to Ethereum.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that the SEC has a May deadline to complete its review of Ethereum ETF applications after already pushing back its original March decision deadline. </p>
<img alt="Ethereum ETFs" class="size-medium" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/LeX170We/" width="1815" />
<p>The price of ETH stands at $3,518, reflecting a 2.5% decrease within the last 24 hours. This decline extends the downward trend observed over the past 30 days, resulting in an accumulated drop of nearly 10%.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Bulls Beware: Deutsche Bank Survey Sparks Fears Of Plunge Below $20,000</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bulls-beware-deutsche-bank-survey-sparks/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bulls-beware-deutsche-bank-survey-sparks/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。德意志银行最近进行的一项消费者调查显示了对比特币价格未来轨迹的分裂看法。调查结果显示了消费者对比特币未来价值下跌至低于20,000美元的悲观预测，尽管比特币最近达到了新的历史高点。专家对比特币未来持乐观态度，技术分析师也提供了关于比特币潜在价格走势的见解。根据技术指标分析，比特币价格可能在2024年7月达到将近14万美元。当前比特币价格有所波动，过去一周上涨了8％，但过去24小时下跌了2％。 <div>
<p>A recent consumer survey by Deutsche Bank <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-09/bitcoin-btc-seen-below-20-000-in-consumer-survey-by-deutsche-bank?utm_content=crypto&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">revealed</a> a split sentiment regarding the future trajectory of Bitcoin&#8217;s price. While grim, this outlook comes when Bitcoin has been on a rollercoaster ride.</p>
<p>The asset has recently achieved a new all-time high and declined significantly following that, but it has rebounded by nearly 10% in the past week.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin Survey Sends Shivers</h2>
<p>Respondents noted a notable level of pessimism about<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/japanese-firm-bitcoin-asia-first-microstrategy/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> the cryptocurrency</a>, with some predicting a potential drop below $20,000.</p>
<p>This unexpected sentiment suggests uncertainty in the market, particularly after BTC reached record highs in mid-March.</p>
<p>The survey, which polled over 3,600 participants, highlighted a divergence of opinions. Approximately one-third anticipate BTC&#8217;s value plummeting to levels last seen during the bear market in 2022.</p>
<p>While consumer sentiment is cautious, expert views on Bitcoin&#8217;s future appear more optimistic. Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital, anticipates that BTC will <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/federal-reserve-rate-cut-will-benefit-bitcoin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">benefit significantly from the Federal Reserve&#8217;s expected rate cuts this year</a>.</p>
<p>Despite the Federal Reserve&#8217;s indications of lowering its benchmark interest rate by up to three-quarters of a point, the timing and extent of these cuts remain uncertain. Investors closely monitor these developments, with expectations for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etf-frenzy-reaches-china-as-top-funds-apply/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">rate reductions</a> shifting rapidly over recent months.</p>
<p>Novogratz, for instance, believes that the Fed&#8217;s decision to lower rates could have &#8220;profound&#8221; implications for the US economy and various assets. While he expresses concerns about the lack of compelling reasons for rate cuts, he remains confident that they will proceed as planned.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Technical Analysis And Price Predictions</h2>
<p>In addition to expert opinions, technical analysts are offering insights into Bitcoin&#8217;s potential price movements. One such analyst, TechDev, has<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-price-set-to-double/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> identified a rare technical pattern in Bitcoin&#8217;s historical price data</a>.</p>
<p>By examining price fluctuations since 2011, TechDev observed a distinct correlation in Bitcoin&#8217;s price behavior across different years. Specifically, TechDev pointed out a pattern where BTC&#8217;s price closed two consecutive months above the upper Bollinger bands, leading to a doubling in price within three months.</p>
<p>Based on this analysis, TechDev suggests that Bitcoin&#8217;s price could surge to almost $140,000 by July 2024. This technical indicator adds <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/by-numbers-how-bitcoin-mining-costs-post-halving/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">another layer</a> to the discussion surrounding BTC&#8217;s future price trajectory, offering investors a potential roadmap for their investment decisions.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, BTC price has experienced notable volatility at the time of writing, with an 8% increase over the past week but a 2% decline in the past 24 hours. </p>

<title>Dogecoin Stalls At $0.2: Why You Should Not Sell Your DOGE Below $1</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-stalls-at-0-2-doge/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-stalls-at-0-2-doge/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章提到了Dogecoin在$0.2价格点受到阻碍，但Elon Musk可能会推动DOGE的上涨。他可能会在社交媒体上表达对DOGE的支持，并计划在他的社交平台上接受DOGE作为支付。同时，DOGE生态系统中的一些发展也引起了投资者的注意。虽然DOGE的交易量有所下降，但近期开展了一些有趣的项目，如Dogecoin Runestone airdrop和Doom游戏在DOGE链上的可玩性。 <div>
<p class="p2">The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-doge-sights-on-0-3/">Dogecoin price</a> has been unable to properly break out of the $0.2 as bears have set up resistance around this level. This has led to a stall around this price point, especially as investors panic and begin to sell their DOGE at what some believe is a high price point. However, is it advisable to sell your Dogecoin holdings at this level?</p>
<h2 class="p2">Elon Musk’s Support Can Drive Dogecoin Rally</h2>
<p class="p2">The Dogecoin price, while it rallied in the past month, is far from achieving the expectations for the coin. A number of factors plays into driving a rise in the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-doge-sights-on-0-3/">DOGE price </a>and none of that have happened so far, leaving room for speculation that the meme coin has yet to begin its bull market movements.</p>

<p class="p2">One of the most prominent drivers of the Dogecoin price increase is the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/elon-musk-gec-doge-1-dogecoin/">support from billionaire Elon Musk</a>. However, Musk has been rather muted about his support for DOGE in recent times, and the euphoria that follows Musk’s show of support is yet to return.</p>
<p class="p2">Expectations are that the SpaceX and Tesla CEO is currently biding his time before showing public support like he did back in 2021. Given this, community members expect the price of Dogecoin to effectively explode when Musk begins tweeting about the coin again.</p>
<p class="p2">There are also expectations that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/elon-musk-tesla-dogecoin/">Musk will integrate DOGE payments into X (formerly Twitter),</a> which he acquired a little over a year ago. The billionaire has previously shared his vision of building a social media platform where DOGE payments are accepted and used to compensate creators for putting their content on the platform.</p>
<p class="p2">So far, Musk has already implemented the compensation for creators as part of his mission, with X paying a portion of its ad revenue to creators. With Musk showing commitment to this vision, it is natural that the Dogecoin community is waiting for him to implement the other part of this, which is accepting <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/elon-musk-tesla-dogecoin-payments/">DOGE payments</a> on the platform and using <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/elon-musk-gec-doge-1-dogecoin/">DOGE</a> to pay out ad revenue.</p>
<p class="p2">DOGE Development On The Move</p>
<p class="p2">Outside of the anticipation that Elon Musk will implement <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/elon-musk-tesla-dogecoin-payments/">Dogecoin payments</a> on X, there have been developments in the ecosystem that have caught investors’ attention. The latest of these is the Dogecoin Runestone airdrop, taking a note from the Bitcoin Runestone airdrop, which has been largely successful so far. The Dogecoin airdrop has been doing quite well, with 30,272 Runestone airdrops done so far. Trading volumes are also on the rise, and the number has crossed 100,000 <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/elon-musk-tesla-dogecoin/">DOGE</a> since then.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Dogecoin leaps into the NFT realm with 30,272 Doge Runestone airdrops, mirroring Bitcoin&#8217;s Runestone project.</p>
<p>Trading hits 80,142 DOGE.</p>
<p>Robo AI&#8217;s new DRC-420 protocol on Doginals is set to enhance Dogecoin media.</p>
<p>Plus, Doom is now playable on the Dogecoin blockchain. <a href="https://t.co/G7EgPSnNYW" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/G7EgPSnNYW</a></p>
<p>— IBC Group Official (@ibcgroupio) <a href="https://twitter.com/ibcgroupio/status/1777052221324058720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">April 7, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p class="p2">However, on its part, Dogecoin has not been seeing encouraging metrics. For starters, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-pepe-wif-meme-coin/">the meme coin</a> has seen its daily trading volumes drop 23% in the last day, according to data from Coinmarketcap. This decline coincides with the drop in price, going from above $0.2 to bulls struggling to establish support above $0.195.</p>

<title>US Treasury Takes Aim At Crypto-Linked Illicit Finance: Is An Increased Crackdown On The Horizon?</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/us-treasury-arsenal-against-crypto-illicit-finance/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/us-treasury-arsenal-against-crypto-illicit-finance/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> 摘要：<br /><br />这些信息是积极的。文章主要讨论了美国财政部寻求增加执法权力以打击外国加密货币服务提供者，以维护国家安全利益。副部长Adeyemo强调了在追踪非法加密交易中的困难，特别是恶意行为者如伊朗和朝鲜的参与。财政部希望通过立法对外国数字资产提供者实施次级制裁，增加其打击非法金融活动的能力。然而，一些木素也指出了加密行业与当局合作打击非法活动的案例。Senator Lummis则主张区分加密资产技术本身和滥用该技术的不良行为者。合规、预防非法活动、创造更安全的生态系统是监管机构、执法机构和加密公司合作的关键。 <div>
<p>In a recent Bloomberg report, it was revealed that the US Treasury Department is urging lawmakers to grant it additional enforcement powers in its fight against foreign providers of cryptocurrency services. The primary objective behind this request is to safeguard national security interests.</p>
<h2>Growing Hurdles In Tracing Illicit Crypto Transactions</h2>
<p>Deputy Secretary Adewale O. Adeyemo, in his written <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-09/us-treasury-seeks-more-sanctions-powers-against-crypto-exchanges" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">testimony </a>before a Senate hearing, highlighted the “growing challenge” of identifying and tracking individuals involved in illicit activities who allegedly exploit the anonymity afforded by crypto assets. </p>
<p>Adeyemo stressed that “malign actors,” including terrorists, are continually adapting their methods to circumvent measures implemented to cut off their access to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/russian-crypto-firms-face-sanctions-by-us-treasury-for-supporting-evasion/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">traditional financial</a> systems.</p>
<p>Adeyemo cited instances of Iran&#8217;s Quds Force, a part of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, using crypto to transfer funds to militant groups such as Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Gaza. He also raised concerns about the increasing involvement of state actors like North Korea and Russia in utilizing digital assets.</p>

<p>To combat these threats, Adeyemo urges lawmakers to authorize the implementation of secondary sanctions targeting foreign digital asset providers that facilitate illicit finance. </p>
<p>This <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-rebellion-leaders-oppose-treasury-tax-plan/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">proposed tool</a> aims to increase the Treasury Department&#8217;s ability to adapt its targeting strategies in response to “technological changes” that have made traditional payment systems reportedly less effective against digital assets.</p>
<p>The Treasury Department is also seeking explicit jurisdiction over prominent digital-asset players, including cryptocurrency exchanges, and the authority to take action against overseas-based crypto platforms that exploit the US financial system while posing a threat to national security.</p>
<p>Adeyemo asserted that without the &#8220;necessary tools&#8221; provided by congressional action, illicit actors&#8217; use of virtual assets will likely grow unchecked. </p>
<h2>Battle Against Illicit Finance</h2>
<p>Despite claims by regulators and lawmakers that the crypto industry facilitates illicit finance and terrorism-related activities, there have been notable instances of the industry working with authorities to combat such issues.</p>
<p>Throughout 2023 and part of 2024, stablecoin issuer Tether <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/tether-freezes-225-million-usdt/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">worked </a>with US authorities and the OKX cryptocurrency exchange to freeze $225 million of its stablecoin linked to a criminal syndicate. </p>
<p>Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino defended the company&#8217;s operations by emphasizing the transparency and traceability of transactions on public blockchains, making USDT, the company&#8217;s stablecoin, an &#8220;impractical choice&#8221; for conducting illicit activities.</p>
<p>Additionally, at a global conference on criminal finance and cryptocurrencies hosted by Europol, it was <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-plays-crucial-role-in-fighting-crime/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">highlighted </a>that increasing understanding and capabilities in the digital arena is crucial for combating physical and virtual organized crime and money laundering. </p>
<p>The conference emphasized the pivotal role of cryptocurrencies in assisting international anti-crime agencies in preventing criminal activities before they occur.</p>
<p>In the United States, Senator Cynthia Lummis has consistently advocated for the crypto industry, asserting that crypto assets are not the problem but rather the bad actors within the industry. </p>
<p>Lummis emphasized in a video <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/us-senator-defends-crypto-crack-down-on-bad-actors/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">statement </a>that judging an entire emerging industry based on incorrect data would be a mistake, emphasizing the need to distinguish between the technology itself and those who misuse it.</p>

<p>While regulators and lawmakers continue to scrutinize the industry, these efforts demonstrate the commitment to compliance, preventing illicit activities, and fostering a safer ecosystem.</p>
<p>Establishing an ongoing collaboration between regulators, law enforcement, and crypto companies is paramount to achieving a balance between innovation and security. It is critical to avoid stifling innovation and imposing blanket exclusions that prevent the industry and its companies from offering their services in the United States or any other jurisdiction.</p>

<title>Crypto Analysts Identify ‘Three Camel Hump’ And ‘Bouncing Point’ For XRP, What’s The Target?</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/three-camel-hump-xrp-analysts/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/three-camel-hump-xrp-analysts/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。XRP加密货币价格已经突破了0.6美元的价格标志，显示出5.88%的价格增长。分析人员发现了一个三座骆驼驼峰形态，预示着XRP可能在接下来的几个月内涨至1.30美元。另一位分析人员指出，XRP对比比特币的表现可能在未来三个月内有所增长。尽管仍面临SEC的诉讼，XRP仍然是美国唯一拥有NYSE上市资格的加密资产。<br /> <div>
<p>XRP has now broken past the $0.6 price mark again after a week of price correction among major cryptocurrencies. The price increase,<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-whales-maintain-positive-accumulation-behavior-ahead-of-2024-halving-report/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> led by Bitcoin</a>, has seen <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dont-miss-the-boat-ethereum-whales-signal-bullish-run-with-40-million-bet/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">most cryptocurrencies turning green</a> since the weekend.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/bitcoin-dogecoin-xrp-months/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">XRP</a>, being one of the largest crypto assets by market cap, has been included in this increase. Although modest compared to its counterparts, XRP pushed to $0.6257 in the past 24 hours, representing a 5.88% price increase.  </p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-price-is-ready-to-breakout/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">popular XRP analysts</a>, the recent move looks like the start of an extended bullish action for the cryptocurrency. Particularly, analyst EGRAG crypto has identified a three-camel hump pattern that could launch XRP to a target zone around $1 to $1.3.</p>
<h2>Three Camel Hump</h2>
<p>In a recent analysis on social media, EGRAG noted a particular price pattern formation on the one-week time frame for XRP that resembles the shape of three camel humps. These humps, noticeably getting increasingly smaller in this case, represent the formation of smaller highs since July 2023.</p>

<p>According to EGRAG, this pattern suggests a bullish breakout could be on the horizon. More importantly, breaking above $0.75 would signal the return of a full bullish momentum. </p>

<p>— EGRAG CRYPTO (@egragcrypto) <a href="https://twitter.com/egragcrypto/status/1777231722918121789?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">April 8, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>If XRP’s price continues this trajectory and this pattern holds through, it could reach as high as $1.30, representing a 116% surge from the $0.60 level. Although XRP is now trading with minor support around $0.55 in the last few months, the analyst noted a stronger support level at $0.40 which is probably the lowest it can reach in the current cycle. </p>
<h2>Bouncing Point</h2>
<p>XRP appears to have found a ‘bouncing point’ around its current price level, as noted by Dark Defender, another crypto analyst. Interestingly, this analyst&#8217;s point of view is based on XRP&#8217;s action against BTC on the XRP/Bitcoin on the 3-month timeframe.</p>
<p>According to Dark Defender, recent price action shows XRP could appreciate against Bitcoin in the next three months (April, May, June). This bullish XRP prediction comes despite the approach of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/by-numbers-how-bitcoin-mining-costs-post-halving/">next Bitcoin halving</a>, which could see Bitcoin <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-resumes-upside-why-btc-could-soon-hit-new-ath/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">surging to a new all-time high</a>. </p>

<p></p>
<p>The chart shared by the analyst showed that the XRP/BTC pair is now looking to bounce off a support level that&#8217;s been in existence since 2015. Interestingly, previous bounces off of this support level have seen XRP outperforming Bitcoin in the months after. </p>

<h2>What’s Next For XRP?</h2>
<p>XRP is currently trading at $0.6092 and bulls are now hoping to establish a support at $0.60. Despite <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/ripple-ceo-5-trillion-in-2024/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Ripple&#8217;s </a>ongoing lawsuit with the SEC, XRP remains the only cryptocurrency with <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-legal-clarity-lawyer-fud/">legal clarity</a> in the US. This has enabled many investors and analysts to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/expertaffirms-ripple-stance-against-xrp-dumping/">maintain a bullish outlook</a> on the asset, with <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/timeline-xrp-price-cross-1000/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">one analyst even predicting</a> a $1,000 price point in the next five to ten years. </p>
<p>In the short term, however, the primary price target is between $1 to $1.3, which XRP has not attained since November 2021.</p>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。Shiba Eternity团队宣布了对其集换卡游戏的重大更新，包括提高用户体验和扩展游戏功能。更新包括改进性能，修复卡片交互问题，并将推出P2E版本进行测试。团队准备在今年第二季度开始P2E版本的测试。Shiba Eternity游戏已取得成功，积极的社区支持和月度比赛提高了游戏的知名度和玩家基础。 <div>
<p>The team behind the Shiba Inu based project Shiba Eternity has announced a significant update to its collectible card game (CCG). The update, which was detailed by the project&#8217;s marketing lead, Lucie (@LucieSHIB), and ecosystem team member, Mazrael.shib (@<i>Mazrael</i>), on X, introduces a suite of enhancements aimed at improving user experience and expanding the game&#8217;s features.</p>
<p>Lucie&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/LucieSHIB/status/1777611520685301786" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> was brimming with enthusiasm: &#8220;Quick Update from the Shiba Eternity Team! They&#8217;ve been bustling behind the scenes! The first version of the project is up and running, and it&#8217;s just been polished with some updates yesterday. But there&#8217;s no slowing down &#8211; they&#8217;re already on to adding new features and tweaking the system.&#8221;</p>
<p>She went on to reveal exciting upcoming features, including updates to kibbles and Shiboshis. Lucie further hinted at an upcoming play-to-earn feature, urging Leash and Shiboshi and SHEB holders to prepare for testing the game on Shibarium.</p>

<p>Mazrael <a href="https://twitter.com/_Mazrael_" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">provided</a> further details on the technical enhancements brought by the update, emphasizing its focus on improving performance and resolving specific gameplay issues. &#8220;The highly anticipated major update for #ShibaEternity is now live, bringing a plethora of enhancements including bug fixes and performance optimizations, to name a few,&#8221; he shared.</p>

<h2>Looking Ahead: The Future Of Shiba Inu&#8217;s Shiba Eternity</h2>
<p>In addition to immediate improvements, the Shiba Inu team is also preparing for the beta testing of the play-to-earn (P2E) version of Shiba Eternity. This move towards a P2E model represents a significant shift in the game&#8217;s dynamics, offering players the potential to earn rewards through gameplay.</p>

<p>The beta testing phase, expected to begin in the second quarter of this year, follows intensive testing to address bugs identified in the version developed by AAA game studio PlaySide Studios. &#8220;Once the team fixes the bugs, it plans to deploy the P2E version for beta testing,&#8221; was shared in anticipation of this next development phase.</p>
<p>The enthusiasm within the Shiba Inu community for the P2E version&#8217;s beta testing is palpable, with players eagerly awaiting official announcements on the testing phase&#8217;s commencement.

<title>Binance CEO’s Thrilling Revelation Sets New Course For Global Headquarters Strategy</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/binance-ceo-drops-bombshell-announcement/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/binance-ceo-drops-bombshell-announcement/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />在与CNBC的访谈中，Binance的CEO介绍了公司的文化转变和对合规的承诺，还强调了公司的成熟发展和可能设立全球总部的计划。公司已经转变为更加注重合规，为了解决与美国司法部的43亿美元罚款达成和解，并进行了内部改组。此外，Binance正在积极探讨设立全球总部的各种选项，以解决其长期存在的批评问题。目前，Binance的本地代币BNB的价格为582美元，过去24小时下跌了2%。 <div>
<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/09/binance-has-matured-past-cultural-issues-ceo-says-after-4point3-billion-us-doj-settlement.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">interview </a>with CNBC, Binance&#8217;s CEO,<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-roadmap-ceo-reveals-future-plans-after-czs/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> Richard Teng</a>, addressed the company&#8217;s “cultural issues” and its commitment to compliance following a $4.3 billion fine settlement with the US Department of Justice (DOJ). </p>
<p>Teng also highlighted Binance&#8217;s transition to &#8220;greater maturity&#8221; and plans for the potential establishment of a global headquarters, the lack of which has been widely criticized by regulators worldwide. </p>
<h2>CEO Emphasizes Cultural Shift Towards Compliance</h2>
<p>The US Department of Justice had accused Binance of adopting a &#8220;move first, ask forgiveness later&#8221; approach. Teng acknowledged the concerns, recognizing that in the early stages of development when regulatory guidelines were “unclear,” Binance operated in a “certain manner.” </p>
<p>However, Teng emphasized that the company has since moved past those cultural issues as it has matured. The exchange&#8217;s CEO claimed that Binance is now committed to sustainability and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/all-crypto-lost-binance-users-cant-retrieve-funds-after-philippines-sec-ban/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">compliance</a>, as evidenced by its efforts to establish a &#8220;robust&#8221; compliance program.</p>

<p>To settle the charges brought by the US government, Binance <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/endgame-for-binance-us-doj-seeks-4-billion/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">agreed to a $4.3 billion settlement</a>, which included a forfeiture of $2.5 billion and a fine of $1.8 billion. </p>
<p>Former CEO <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-former-ceo-czs-wealth-skyrockets-25-billion/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Changpeng Zhao</a> (CZ) stepped down and was <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-ceo-to-step-down-4-billion-settlement/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">charged </a>with violating the Bank Secrecy Act. Zhao&#8217;s sentencing was postponed until April 30, as indicated by a notice in a Seattle federal court. </p>
<p>Along the same line, Binance was accused of allowing transactions between US users and individuals in jurisdictions subject to US sanctions. The DOJ stated that Zhao&#8217;s decision to prioritize Binance&#8217;s growth over compliance with US law led to these illegal transactions. </p>
<p>In response to regulatory concerns, Binance appointed its <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-establishes-first-ever-board-of-directors/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">first board of directors</a>, including several non-executive directors. Teng defended the board&#8217;s composition, saying it reflects a combination of internal and external expertise needed to drive the company forward and ensure appropriate technology and product improvements.</p>
<h2>Binance Explores Options For Global Headquarters</h2>
<p>During the interview, it was disclosed that Binance has not yet reached a definitive conclusion regarding its <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-us-board-changpeng-cz-zhao-steps-down/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">global headquarters</a>. However, the exchange actively explores multiple options to resolve the long-standing criticism surrounding its lack of a centralized headquarters.</p>
<p>Teng stressed the importance of a deliberate process for selecting a jurisdiction with the regulatory framework to support Binance&#8217;s wide range of products and user base. </p>

<p>The decision also factors in the ability to establish a “robust corporate headquarters” and attract talent. Notably, Paris had previously been suggested as a potential location for the exchange&#8217;s global headquarters, but the company is reportedly evaluating various considerations before making a decision and making the proper announcement.</p>
<img alt="Binance" class="size-medium" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/JcmUMiqm/" width="1815" />
<p>Currently, the exchange&#8217;s native token, BNB, is trading at $582. This represents a 2% decline over the past 24 hours. Notably, the price of BNB has displayed a distinct pattern of range-bound movement between $578 and $590 over the past four days.</p>

<title>The Stats Are In: Dogecoin Beats Out Ethereum, Shiba Inu To Become Second Most Traded Coin</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-ethereum-shiba-inu/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-ethereum-shiba-inu/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章介绍了狗狗币在韩国主要加密货币交易所上的成就，成为第二大交易加密货币。文章提到狗狗币在Upbit交易所超越了其他知名加密货币以及模因币，展示了其在韩国日益增长的知名度。同时，比特币依然是交易量最高的加密货币，但狗狗币作为第二名，表现出潜力成为更受欢迎的数字货币。狗狗币的价格也在过去一周有所增长，显示出其对投资者的吸引力。 <div>
<p><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/dogecoin-2/dogecoin-rally-intensifies-eyes-set-on-historic-new-highs/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dogecoin</a> has scored a new milestone by becoming one of the top-traded cryptocurrencies on a major cryptocurrency exchange in Korea. </p>
<h2>South Korean Markets Embrace Dogecoin</h2>
<p>In a clear testament to <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-holder-base-record/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dogecoin’s soaring popularity and interest</a> in global markets, the cryptocurrency has recently claimed the title of the second most traded crypto asset on <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/exchanges/upbit/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Upbit</a>, South Korea&#8217;s leading crypto exchange. This development marks a significant step for the doggy-themed cryptocurrency, which has been <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-open-interest-record/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">witnessing a significant bullish trend</a> in recent months. </p>

<p>On the crypto exchange, Dogecoin had notably surpassed prominent cryptocurrencies like <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereums-reputation-takes-a-hit-as-trading-veteran/">Ethereum (ETH)</a> and meme coins like <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-692-billion-shib/">Shiba Inu (SHIB)</a>, in terms of trading volume. The surge in trading activity has effectively put the spotlight on Dogecoin, potentially reshaping its former title as a meme coin based on a joke, into a highly sought-after cryptocurrency with a robust ecosystem and community. </p>
<p>Currently, Upbit lists about 192 cryptocurrencies and offers over 300 trading pairs. The exchange has successfully grown into a prominent crypto platform since its inception in 2017. </p>
<p>Dogecoin’s achievement in becoming the second most traded cryptocurrency on Upbit underscores the coin’s growing popularity in Korea. As South Korea continues to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/south-korea-fiu-crypto-regulatory-landscape/">solidify its position as a burgeoning crypto hub</a>, DOGE is set to elevate its prominence further to gain widespread adoption in the country. </p>
<p>Possibly aiming to extend its services to the vast pool of potential <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/south-korea-tightens-om-crypto-regulations-incoming/">crypto users in South Korea</a>’s 51.63 million population, Dogecoin is positioned for immense growth within this rapidly developing market </p>
<h2>Bitcoin Secures Top Spot In Crypto Exchange</h2>
<p>While <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-major-roadblock/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dogecoin</a> has secured the second position as the most traded cryptocurrency on <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/upbit-fake-apt-tokens-wreak-havoc-in-south-korea/">Upbit</a>, Bitcoin has easily dominated the doggy-themed meme coin, emerging as the number one traded cryptocurrency on the exchange. <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-resumes-upside-why-btc-could-soon-hit-new-ath/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Bitcoin</a> has been on a steady momentum since the beginning of the year, surging to new all-time highs and growing in trading volume daily. </p>

<p>Although Bitcoin remains the world’s most popular and globally accepted coin, Dogecoin’s prominence on Upbit was an unprecedented milestone. The rapid growth of the doggy-themed cryptocurrency presents a potential opportunity to take first place, possibly surpassing even Bitcoin. </p>
<p>Unlike Bitcoin, which requires <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-eclipses-72000-5-major-factors/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">significant financial investments</a> before it can be acquired, Dogecoin offers a more attractive investment avenue with its <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-price-breaks-new-3-year-high-here-are-factors-that-could-drive-the-price-to-1/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">lower price</a> per coin, enabling investors globally, particularly in South Korea to easily trade the token. </p>
<p>At the time of writing, the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/doge/dogecoin-price-support-0-1220/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">price of Dogecoin</a> is trading at $0.1952 per token, reflecting a price increase of $4.23% over the past seven days, according to CoinMarketCap. </p>

<title>Bitcoin Trading At A Huge Discount: This Pre-Halving Dip Last Chance to Buy?</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-huge-discount-pre-halving-dip-buy/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-huge-discount-pre-halving-dip-buy/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />比特币正在以三周高位交易，分析师对此感到乐观。预计比特币即将迎来Halving事件，分析师建议持币者不要恐慌抛售，因为价格可能会在未来几个月下跌。自3月15日以来，比特币一直受到压力，但在3月20日出现复苏迹象，目前仍未确定牛市是否有足够的动力将BTC推上74000美元。一些分析师预计比特币在Halving事件后将会上涨。技术分析显示比特币已经突破了一个牛市旗形图，MACD指标也逼近“金叉”，这对买家来说是一个重大的发展。 <div>
<p>Bitcoin is changing hands at around a three-week high when writing following refreshing gains on April 8. With the coin trading higher and above previous resistances, now support, analysts on X are upbeat. </p>
<p>In a post, one analyst <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/rektcapital/status/1777370285886386484" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">said</a> the recent dip before the upcoming Halving could be the final fire sale of 2024 before ordinary folks are priced out. For what&#8217;s expected in the coming months, the analyst urges traders and coin holders against panic selling even if prices coil lower from spot rates. </p>
<img alt="Bitcoin pre-halving dip | Source: Analyst on X" class="size-full wp-image-293085" height="723" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GKp8ghXX0AA_OHa.jpg?resize=1024%2C723" width="1024" />
<h2>Bitcoin Is Rising: Trading At A 3-Week High</h2>
<p>Since March 15, Bitcoin has been under pressure, days after breaking higher and registering a new all-time high at around $73,800. While the moment was historic, the subsequent dump saw the coin drop as deep as 15%, bottoming at around $61,000. </p>

<p>The recovery on March 20 is the basis of the current leg up. However, it is yet to be seen whether bulls have sufficient momentum to drive BTC above $74,000, with the Bitcoin Halving event scheduled for roughly ten days from April 9.</p>
<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/x/wTSlnj3Z/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Bitcoin price trending upward on the daily chart | Source: BTCUSDT on Binance, TradingView" class="size-full" height="827" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/wTSlnj3Z/" width="1787" /></a>
<p>Some analysts expect the coin to tear higher after Halving. When Bitcoin halves, the network automatically halves its miner rewards. That means miners at the core of securing the platform and ensuring all transactions are valid and available will have to contend with drastically lower revenue. </p>
<p>However, another consequence of the Halving event will be a possible <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/will-bitcoin-burst-demand-outpaces-supply/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">supply crisis</a>, especially if the current level of demand is sustained. So far, BTC has soared to all-time highs, breaking 2021 peaks of $70,000.</p>
<h2>All Indicators Support Bulls: Is BTC Ready To Rip?</h2>
<p>Since institutions are said to be accumulating Bitcoin via spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), some analysts insist that the next epoch, once Halving happens, will differ from the past retail-driven price action. </p>

<p>As data <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1777325384209404308" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">shows</a>, spot Bitcoin ETFs offered by Fidelity and BlackRock have seen consistent inflow since launching.</p>
<img alt="Longest inflow streak | Analyst on X" class="size-full wp-image-293088" height="353" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot120.png?resize=648%2C353" width="648" />
<p>From a technical analysis standpoint, another analyst observed that the coin has broken above a bullish flag. Additionally, the MACD indicator is nearing a &#8220;bull cross,&#8221; a massive development for buyers. Traders eagerly await confirmation of this bullish momentum on the daily charts – all within two crucial weeks before the halving.</p>

<title>Floki And TokenFi Developers Propose Game-changing Upgrade – Here’s What It Does</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/floki-tokenfi-upgrade/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/floki-tokenfi-upgrade/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。Floki和TokenFi开发者提出了“超级充能计划”，旨在让$TOKEN持有者和持有者在TokenFi发行平台中优先获得。提议要求$TOKEN持有者必须持有价值$1,000的$TOKEN，以参与超级充能计划，并在令牌销售中享有优先购买权。持有者也有类似的机会，但是分配量可能较少。这将为生态系统带来更多的机会，尽管可能会对未持有或未持有$TOKEN的人造成限制。如果提案通过，计划将在通过后尽快执行。 <div>
<p>The developers of TokenFi, a sister project of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/floki-inu-sees-double-digit-gains/">meme coin FLOKI</a>, have put forward a proposal that could represent a major upgrade to the TokenFi launchpad. This proposal aims to prioritize $TOKEN stakers and holders within the ecosystem. </p>
<h2>Floki And TokenFi Developers Propose “Supercharge Program”</h2>
<p>This <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/floki-inu.eth/proposal/0x63da6d0875e8017bc10c10239f4de493ca84a4744ce7a40fc30a9dca96422df0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">proposal</a>, which aims to launch the “TokenFi Launchpad Supercharge Program,” will give $TOKEN stakers and holders a “priority within the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/hong-kong-regulator-flags-floki-staking-products/">TokenFI launchpad</a>.” The launchpad is a decentralized platform that allows anyone to launch and raise funds for their tokens. As part of the ecosystem’s tradition, they usually put forward some of the best token launches to the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/floki-inu-floki-claps-back-counters-bitgets-claim-of-breaching-7-day-listing-deadline/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">TokenFi/Floki community</a>. </p>

<p>However, they are looking to go one further with this proposal as they have now realized that some token sale events get sold out within minutes without the community actually benefitting from it. Therefore, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/lunc-ustc-revival-proposal/">they propose</a>, through the “supercharge program,” that these <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-staking-eth-price/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">$TOKEN stakers</a> should get a headstart in these token sale events. </p>
<p>That means these stakers will have the opportunity to purchase these tokens even before the general public gets wind of it. However, there is a caveat as only those who have $1,000 worth of $TOKEN staked will be able to participate in the program. Meanwhile, those who have staked more $TOKEN and for a longer period will enjoy a larger share of the allocation from these token sales. </p>
<h2>$TOKEN Holders To Also Get Priority </h2>
<p>Furthermore, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/lunc-recovery-impossible-terra/">the developers</a> have proposed that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/over-90-of-bitcoin-holders-profit-46000-break-data/">$TOKEN holders</a> should also get a headstart over the general public in the event that the stakers do not purchase all the available token allocations within the set time. Similar to the stakers, holders will also need to hold $1,000 worth of $TOKEN to participate in this program. </p>
<p>Those with a larger $TOKEN holding will also likely enjoy a greater chunk of the remaining allocation. However, the proposal noted that holders would generally get smaller allocations than stakers. </p>

<p>If this proposal eventually passes, those who do not stake or hold $TOKEN might not be able to participate in hyped token launches on the launchpad. This is because stakers and holders are likely to buy all the available allocations for the token sale even before it gets to the general public. </p>
<p>The TokenFi team added in the proposal that if the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ustc-lunc-1-terra-classic-proposal/">proposal passes</a>, the program will be executed as soon as possible. This will be done “ideally within a few days after its passage,” they claimed. </p>
<p>At the time of wriitng, TOKEN is trading at around $0.1518, down over 6% in the last 24 hours according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/tokenfi/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">data</a> from CoinMarketCap. </p>

<title>A Presidential Disaster: Trump MAGA Coin Crashes 60% In Crypto Catastrophe</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/trump-maga-coin-crashes-60-in-crypto-catastrophe/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/trump-maga-coin-crashes-60-in-crypto-catastrophe/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章首先介绍了特朗普从加密货币中获得的数百万美元，主要来源于数字交易卡片销售和MAGA币。然而，由于加密市场的波动，特朗普的投资价值出现了下降。MAGA币和以太坊价格显着下跌，导致特朗普的加密资产减少到530万美元，较之前下降超过300万美元。特朗普错失了在价格高峰时出售代币的机会，进一步加剧了价值下降的影响。 <div>
<p>Former President Donald Trump&#8217;s foray into the world of cryptocurrency has been met with both triumph and turbulence. Recent reports reveal that Trump has made millions from his<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/donald-trump-lost-over-3-193013246.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> crypto investments</a>, yet the heightened volatility in the crypto markets has taken a toll on his portfolio.</p>

<h2><strong>Trump&#8217;s Crypto Windfall</strong></h2>
<p>It all began when Trump&#8217;s name, image, and likeness were utilized in a non-fungible token (NFT) project called Trump Digital Trading Cards. These unique digital collectibles, priced at $99 each, swiftly gained traction and sold a staggering 45,000 units in December 2022.</p>
<p>Since then, Trump has been receiving royalties on trading volumes, accumulating over 1,800 Ethereum (ETH) and Wrapped Ethereum (WETH) tokens, data from <a href="https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/explorer/entity/donald-trump" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Arkham Intelligence</a> shows.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-293054" height="516" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/a_e909f0.png?resize=963%2C516" width="963" /></p>

<h2><strong>Unexpected Crypto Journey</strong></h2>
<p>As the crypto landscape continued to evolve, Trump&#8217;s crypto journey took an unforeseen turn. In the summer of 2023, Trump became the recipient of a considerable number of MAGA Coin (TRUMP) tokens, a meme coin created in his honor.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/SzXk1tpS/" width="2475" /></p>

<p>At the time, the nearly 580,000 TRUMP tokens were worth just a few thousand dollars. However, the value of TRUMP skyrocketed as Trump performed well in primary elections and secured the Republican nomination. This surge in value propelled Trump&#8217;s portfolio to new heights, with the MAGA Coin alone accounting for the bulk of his $8.5 million crypto holdings.</p>
<strong>Missed Opportunities And Value Decline</strong>
<p>Despite the initial success of his crypto investments, <a href="https://platform.arkhamintelligence.com/explorer/entity/donald-trump" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Trump&#8217;s portfolio</a> has recently faced challenges as the price of MAGA Coin and ETH experienced significant declines. The value of TRUMP reached its peak on March 4, reaching an impressive $11.56 per token. However, since then, the coin has experienced a sharp decline and is currently trading around $4, marking a 61% decrease over the past month.</p>

<strong>MAGA Loses 60% Of Its Value</strong>
<p>Since MAGA&#8217;s early March highs, its price has significantly decreased. On March 4, the token reached a high of $11.56, but it is <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/maga/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">currently trading at about $5.93.</a> The recent 60% decline in price has had a detrimental effect on Trump&#8217;s cryptocurrency holdings.</p>

<p>The downturn in the crypto market has had a considerable impact on Trump&#8217;s crypto investments, which has fallen to $5.3 million, representing a decline of over $3 million. The missed opportunity to sell his tokens during the peak in early March has further exacerbated the decline in value.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Bulls Rejoice: Galaxy Digital CEO Believes Fed Rate Cut Will Benefit BTC</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/federal-reserve-rate-cut-will-benefit-bitcoin/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/federal-reserve-rate-cut-will-benefit-bitcoin/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />Mike Novogratz认为，随着美联储降息的预期，比特币可能会在未来几个月内大幅上涨。他认为，美联储的降息将为比特币等资产创造良好的格局，推动其价格增长。预计美联储将在今年降低三个季度点，这将提高市场流动性，激励投资者增加对比特币等数字资产的投资，从而推动其价格上涨。Davis等分析师也认为，这一事件可能会显著影响比特币的价格，预示比特币有一个乐观的一年。 <div>
<p>Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency asset could see a significant rise in the coming months as Mike Novogratz, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Galaxy Digital <a href="https://x.com/novogratz/status/1777483185430929572" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">foresees</a> BTC to benefit substantially from the anticipated Federal Reserve cut rates this year.</p>
<h2>Fed Cut Rate, A Great Set Up For Bitcoin</h2>
<p>The Federal Reserve has been indicating since December last year that it plans to lower its benchmark<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/disastrous-crypto-fed-raises-interest-rates-50-bps/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> interest rate</a> this year by the amount of three-quarter points, from the current range of 5.25 to 5.5%.</p>

<p>However, policymakers adopted language the following month indicating that they would maintain the policy rate in the current aforementioned range until they have &#8220;greater confidence&#8221; that inflation will reach the Fed&#8217;s target of 2%.</p>
<p>In 2024, the markets are pricing in two quarter-point rate cuts by the Fed and a 50% chance of a third, which is a significant reversal from the beginning of the year when six to seven cuts were anticipated.</p>
<p>Over the past several months, expectations concerning the extent and timing of the Fed&#8217;s rate reduction have rapidly changed. Investors are gradually losing faith in policymakers&#8217; ability to reduce borrowing costs without inciting an inflationary resurgence in a robust economy.</p>
<p>Sharing his insights on the subject, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-boom-countdown-galaxy-ceo-casts-bullish/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Mike Novogratz</a> voiced worry about the effects on the United States economy and several assets. Even though Novogratz cannot think of a single compelling reason why the Fed should lower rates, he is confident they will still go ahead with it. </p>
<p>Thus, he has stressed the urgent need for a politician who will take serious action and drastically reduce expenditure, drawing attention to Washington, DC&#8217;s glaring silence on the subject.</p>
<p>While Novogratz highlights that the development will pave a terrible setup for the US, he believes it will benefit several precious assets such as <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-open-interest-all-time-high-btc-72000/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin</a>, Gold, and Silver.</p>
<p>The CEO&#8217;s summary of how a rate decrease will help Bitcoin and precious metals reflects a systematic approach to asset diversification and risk management in a monetary easing ecosystem. Those who prioritize Novogratz&#8217;s research may now view this as a favorable time to realign their portfolios and increase their holdings in assets that tend to gain from changes in monetary policy. </p>
<h2>BTC Price Poised For Growth Amid Rate Reduction</h2>
<p>Novogratz&#8217;s overview aligns with Lark Davis&#8217;, a popular cryptocurrency analyst <a href="https://x.com/TheCryptoLark/status/1775939103185379536" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">insights</a>, who also believes the event could impact the price of Bitcoin significantly, suggesting an optimistic year for the crypto asset.</p>

<p>Considering Goldman Sachs&#8217;s prediction on the terminal interest rates, Davis affirms that these cuts will improve market liquidity and motivate investors to invest more money in digital assets like Bitcoin, thereby propelling its price.</p>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/goldman-sachs-maintains-crypto-skepticism/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Goldman Sachs</a> predicts there will be three rate reductions; the first is slated for June, and the range of terminal interest rates is expected to be between 3.25 and 3.5%.</p>

<p>The price of Bitcoin has increased along with a notable increase in its implied volatilities for a number of important phrases. The daily volatility increased by almost 80%, indicating forecasts for increased price volatility in the near future.</p>
<p>The market&#8217;s attitude has drastically changed as a result of this spike in volatility, with an increasing proportion of traders taking a bullish stance.</p>

<p>Moreover, Bitcoin&#8217;s daily trading volume also surged by almost 80% today, signifying increased market participation as more investors enter the fray, amplifying the bullish sentiment.</p>
<p>The leading crypto&#8217;s increase in volatility presents a complex scenario. On the one hand, the rising price is undeniably a bullish signal, potentially attracting new investors seeking capital appreciation.</p>

<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Bitcoin broke through the $70,000 zone without warning, one step away from a new all-time high.
The rapid rise has driven all major term IVs up significantly, with BTC Dvol now over 78%, and market sentiment has quickly reversed to a long atmosphere.
More than 600 BTC of $100,000… <a href="https://t.co/JY9QXyzGMi" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/JY9QXyzGMi</a></p>

<p></p>
<p>However, the significant increase in IV injects a dose of caution. The market is anticipating a period of substantial price swings, both upwards and downwards.</p>
<p>As the market&#8217;s positive momentum persists, the imminent crypto halving event further fuels optimism. These halving events historically curtail the rate of new<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> Bitcoin</a> creation, potentially augmenting its value due to its constrained supply. This event typically catalyzes the coin&#8217;s price surge, often culminating in new all-time highs.</p>
<h2><strong>Call Options Signal Bullish Outlook: Will Bitcoin Break $100,000?</strong></h2>
<p>The recent surge in bullish sentiment within the cryptocurrency market, especially towards Bitcoin, has been striking.</p>
<p>This sentiment was underlined by a noteworthy block trade of more than 600 BTC $100,000 strike call options, valued at up to $45 million with premiums of $8.5 million, showcasing traders&#8217; confidence in Bitcoin&#8217;s potential to reach or surpass the $100,000 mark. This surge highlights an increasing optimism prevailing in the market.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Bitcoin&#8217;s price escalated by 5% today, surpassing the $71,000 threshold, further bolstering this optimism. This upward trajectory was reinforced by nearly $570 million net inflow into spot Bitcoin ETFs over the past week, indicating a burgeoning interest in the &#8220;digital gold&#8221; as an investment avenue.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/YKMIYV6Q/" width="2475" /></p>

<strong>Anticipation On Halving Grows</strong>
<p>With the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-analyst-sees-100k-before-halving/">halving event</a> on the horizon, the anticipation of achieving new peaks, potentially breaching the $100,000 milestone, intensifies among investors and market observers.</p>
<p>This growing optimism finds resonance in the substantial block trade of $100,000 strike call options, affirming the market&#8217;s confidence in Bitcoin&#8217;s capacity to scale new heights.</p>

<p>The cryptocurrency market is currently immersed in a significant wave of bullish sentiment, particularly regarding the top crypto asset. This optimism stems from a confluence of factors including Bitcoin&#8217;s recent price surge, escalating interest in Bitcoin ETFs, and the anticipation surrounding the upcoming halving event.</p>

<title>Solana Devs Set Sights On April 15 To Fix Network Congestion</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/solana-april-15-fix-network-congestion/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> 摘要：<br /><br />这些信息是积极的。Solana开发人员将在4月15日进行关键更新，解决网络拥塞问题。该问题源于实现BUG而不是设计缺陷，主要涉及QUIC协议。Solana基金会正在努力解决拥塞问题，包括软件补丁和系统更新。1.18版本承诺增强交易调度和减少瓶颈。此外，Solana还计划在去中心化应用中采用动态优先费用。 <div>
<p>Solana developers are gearing up for a crucial update scheduled for April 15 aimed at resolving the pressing issue of network congestion. This move comes in the wake of transaction <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-existential-moment-co-founder-speaks-out/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">failures skyrocketing</a> due to an &#8220;implementation bug&#8221; as elucidated by Mert Mumtaz, CEO of Helius Labs. Helius Labs is at the forefront of providing backend support exclusively to the network, playing a pivotal role in its ongoing maintenance and enhancement.</p>
<h2>Solana Congestion Soon Over?</h2>
<p>Mumtaz has <a href="https://twitter.com/0xMert_/status/1777400489488900102" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">clarified</a> that the root cause of the current debacle is not inherent to the design of Solana but stems from a flaw in the implementation of a specific protocol. “Solana&#8217;s current issue is not a design flaw, it&#8217;s an implementation bug,&#8221; Mumtaz stated, emphasizing the distinction between design errors, which are fundamental, and implementation errors, which are often more manageable and rectifiable.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s crucial to understand the difference between a design flaw and an implementation bug. The latter can be fixed more easily and doesn&#8217;t indict the fundamental architecture of Solana,&#8221; Mumtaz stated in a detailed X post.</p>
<p>The issue at hand revolves around the network&#8217;s implementation of QUIC, a data transfer protocol originally developed by Google, which has exhibited deficiencies impacting the networks&#8217; throughput and reliability. To elucidate, Mumtaz offered an analogy: &#8220;If a BMW model has steering problems, it doesn&#8217;t mean all cars are flawed. Similarly, Solana&#8217;s challenge is not with its core design but with a specific implementation aspect of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>In a comment that resonates with Mumtaz&#8217;s perspective, SOL researcher Richard Patel noted, &#8220;Our investigation indicates that alternative implementations like Firedancer do not share the same vulnerabilities. This confirms our belief that the solution requires a targeted approach rather than a complete overhaul.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the community looks forward to the April 15 update, Mumtaz cautioned, &#8220;Obviously, if additional issues are discovered in testing, this might get delayed.”</p>

<p></p>
<p>The backdrop to this network strain is a significant uptick in spam transactions and a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-founder-buterin-whatmemecoins-could-be/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">memecoin craze</a>, which has overwhelmed Solana&#8217;s processing capabilities. The Phantom wallet and other applications have alerted users to anticipate delays, underscoring the urgency of the congestion issue.</p>

<p>Matt Sorg, associated with the Solana Foundation, shed light on the network&#8217;s architecture, which processes transactions directly without a mempool, akin to internet IP endpoints. &#8220;This direct dispatch model, while efficient, is vulnerable to spam overload, resulting in transaction dropouts. It&#8217;s a nuanced issue we&#8217;re addressing head-on,&#8221; Sorg <a href="https://twitter.com/tamgros/status/1776396573393527253" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">revealed</a> on X.</p>
<p>Solana&#8217;s development team is reportedly working on multiple fronts to navigate out of these congested waters, including software patches and system updates aimed at bolstering network capacity and resilience. The forthcoming 1.18 update is particularly anticipated for its promise to enhance transaction scheduling and reduce bottlenecks.</p>
<p>An additional measure to improve network functionality involves the adoption of dynamic priority fees in decentralized applications (<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/coinbase-base-opens-doors-featuring-100-dapps/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">dApps</a>) on Solana. &#8220;Incorporating priority fees is pivotal for optimizing transaction processing and user experience,&#8221; a March blog post from Solana Labs <a href="https://solana.com/news/block-optimization-on-the-solana-network" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">articulated</a>.</p>
<p>At press time, SOL traded at $176.</p>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。Metaplanet Inc.在东京证券交易所上市，并承诺将比特币作为其主要财务资产的重要组成部分，首次投资10亿日元。该公司得到了来自Sora Ventures、UTXO Management等合作伙伴的支持。该举措被视为重大里程碑，显示了该公司在数字资产领域的领先地位。日本投资者可以通过与Sora Ventures合作，无需支付高达55%的未实现收益税，获得比特币的投资。Metaplanet的股价在该公告后上涨了90%，展示了市场的乐观看法。 <div>
<p>Metaplanet Inc., a diversified enterprise listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, has officially embraced Bitcoin as a principal component of its treasury assets, committing an initial investment of JPY 1 billion (about $6.56 million). This strategic pivot positions Metaplanet to potentially become &#8220;Asia&#8217;s first MicroStrategy,&#8221; referencing the American company known for its substantial <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/microstrategy-1-of-all-bitcoin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">BTC holdings</a>.</p>
<h2>The Bitcoin Playbook By MicroStrategy</h2>
<p>Metaplanet&#8217;s announcement on X (formerly Twitter) elaborated on its decision, emphasizing the move as a blend of finance and innovation. The initiative is supported by a notable consortium, including Sora Ventures, UTXO Management, and individuals like Mark Yusko (founder, CEO &amp; CIO of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-advocate-provides-key-insights-on-growth/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Morgan Creek Capital</a>) and Jack Liu (founding member of Ordswap), signaling strong backing from the venture capital and cryptocurrency communities</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Excited to announce that Sora Ventures is working with Metaplanet [&#8230;] The product will enable Japanese to gain exposure to bitcoin without paying an unrealized gains tax that could </strong><strong>go as high as 55%. It will also enable anyone with an account to Tokyo Stock Exchange to gain exposure to bitcoin without any regulatory risks.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Operating in sectors ranging from hotel development to Web3 consulting and real estate investments, Metaplanet has positioned itself as a dynamic player with a global footprint. Despite its relatively modest market cap of 4.27 billion JPY ($28 million), significantly smaller than that of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/microstrategy-bitcoin-end-game-saylor-plan/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">MicroStrategy</a>, the world&#8217;s leading corporate holder of BTC, Metaplanet&#8217;s stock surged by 90% following the announcement.</p>
<p>The reactions from the community were predominantly positive.

<title>Bitcoin ETF Frenzy Reaches China As Top Funds Apply For Approval In Hong Kong</title>

<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etf-frenzy-reaches-china-as-top-funds-apply/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。中国金融巨头汇丰基金和南方基金正在申请发行新的现货比特币ETF。与此同时，中国香港子公司正在加速比特币ETF推进。行业内人士预测，比特币ETF申请可能在今年第二季度得到实施。香港正在考虑促进现货比特币ETF的创造和赎回，这将显著提高该地区的资产管理规模和吸引力。了解这些动态，表明香港有望成为数字资产领域的重要枢纽。 <div>
<p>China&#8217;s financial giants Harvest Fund and Southern Fund have recently filed applications to launch a new spot Bitcoin ETF, <a href="https://www.stcn.com/article/detail/1167888.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">according </a>to local media outlet Securities Times.</p>
<h2>Harvest Fund And Southern Fund Spearhead Bitcoin ETF Push In China</h2>
<p>Despite China&#8217;s <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/will-hong-kongs-bitcoin-etfs-outshine-us-peers/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">historical skepticism</a> towards Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, leading funds are now actively seeking regulatory approval to launch Bitcoin ETFs.</p>
<p>Harvest Fund, with its Hong Kong subsidiary, and Southern Fund, through its Hong Kong arm, have taken the initiative to apply for and deploy Bitcoin ETFs. </p>
<p>Moreover, China Asset Management&#8217;s Hong Kong subsidiary has recently partnered with a Bitcoin <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-broadens-reach/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">ETF custodian</a>, highlighting the expanding scope of collaborations in the industry.</p>
<p>Per the report, the fund industry in Hong Kong has become a testing ground for new Bitcoin investment products. With the support of their Hong Kong subsidiaries, leading funds can expand their product lines and investment scope. This move allows them to tap into the growing demand for alternative investment options in the region.</p>

<p>Adding to the excitement surrounding the potential approval of new Bitcoin ETF applications, the successful launch of Asia&#8217;s first cryptocurrency ETFs by China Southern Fund&#8217;s Hong Kong subsidiary, CSOP, has reportedly generated significant interest in the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/australian-asset-manager-to-launch-bitcoin-etf-on-cboe-in-q2/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">crypto market</a>. </p>
<p>Despite market volatility, CSOP&#8217;s FA Southern Bitcoin Futures ETF has reportedly generated impressive returns and trading volume, attracting the attention of other public funds and investors.</p>
<p>Furthermore, at the &#8220;2024 Hong Kong Web3 Carnival,&#8221; regulatory authorities expressed their commitment to fostering industry participation and implementing comprehensive public education. </p>
<p>This approach aims to encourage the development of digital asset markets while striking a balance between innovation and oversight, signaling a notable shift from the previous regulatory stance towards the industry. </p>
<p>In addition, the report highlights the ongoing cooperation between China Asset Management&#8217;s Hong Kong branch and the HashKey Exchange, which demonstrates efforts to establish a new <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etf-issuer-vaneck-dives-stablecoin-market/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">regulatory framework</a> for virtual assets.</p>
<h2>Approvals Expected In Q2</h2>
<p>The Securities Times reported that industry insiders predict that Bitcoin ETF applications could be implemented as early as the second quarter of this year. </p>
<p>The report also notes that Hong Kong is considering facilitating the creation and redemption of spot Bitcoin ETFs, which could significantly increase the asset management scale and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/goldman-sachs-maintains-crypto-skepticism/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">trading volume</a> in the region. </p>

<p>Ultimately, with Harvest Fund managing over $230 billion in assets and Southern Fund managing over $280 billion, their entry into the Bitcoin ETF space reflects the growing institutional interest in digital assets.</p>
<p>As the regulatory landscape evolves and industry support strengthens, Hong Kong could position itself as a key hub for new Bitcoin investment products, paving the way for wider adoption of digital assets in the region.</p>
<img alt="Bitcoin ETF" class="size-medium" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/wO4UahH8/" width="1815" />
<p>As of the current update, the price of BTC stands at $71,900, representing a 3.8% increase in the last 24 hours. Moreover, the largest cryptocurrency in the market has shown a positive trend over the past seven days, with a 4% upward movement. </p>
<p>This recent surge breaks the previous consolidation phase observed between the $65,000 and $68,000 price range that persisted for the past week.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Open Interest Sets All-Time High As BTC Crosses $72,000</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-open-interest-all-time-high-btc-72000/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-open-interest-all-time-high-btc-72000/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章显示比特币的开放利息达到了新的历史最高水平，随着加密货币价格突破72000美元。开放利息是一个指标，跟踪所有交易所上的比特币衍生合同的总额。随着这一指标的上升，投资者在衍生市场上开启更多头寸，导致市场总量增加，可能导致更多波动性。比特币价格正处于约71500美元，上涨5%。 <div>
<p>Data shows the Bitcoin Open Interest has set a new all-time high (ATH) as the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price has surged above $72,000.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Open Interest Has Shot Up Recently</h2>
<p>CryptoQuant Netherlands community manager Maartunn explained in a <a href="https://twitter.com/JA_Maartun/status/1777299516632285214" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X that the BTC Open Interest has just reached a new ATH. The &#8220;<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-open-interest-all-time-high-explosive-move/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Open Interest</a>&#8221; is an indicator that tracks the total amount of Bitcoin derivative contracts currently open on all exchanges.</p>
<p>When the value of this metric rises, investors will open more positions in the derivative market right now. Generally, the total <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-leverage-ratio-rises-volatile-move-incoming/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">leverage</a> in the market increases when this trend occurs. As such, the asset may be more likely to become volatile following an increase in the Open Interest.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the indicator going down implies the investors either are closing up positions of their own volition or are getting forcibly liquidated by the platform with which their position is open. Since the leverage would decrease in this situation, the price might become more stable.</p>
<p>Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Open Interest over the past few years:</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Open Interest" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="2580" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GKo8c_jWUAAwiJY?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096" width="4096" /></p>

<p>As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Open Interest has registered sharp growth recently and has increased to a new ATH of around $18.2 billion. This surge has come as the price of the cryptocurrency has also rallied.</p>
<p>This trend isn&#8217;t anything unusual, as price jumps usually attract a large amount of attention to the cryptocurrency, and with it comes a new round of speculation on the derivative side.</p>
<p>The previous ATH of the indicator was achieved last month when Bitcoin set a price record beyond the $73,000 level. As mentioned before, though, the rising indicator can lead to more volatility in the price.</p>
<p>In theory, this volatility can go either way, but recent peaks in the metric have coincided with local tops in the price. The chart shows that the previous Open Interest ATH also unwound in a rapid decline for the asset.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to say if BTC will follow a similar fate this time around, but what can be said is that it could probably become more volatile going forward if these extreme Open Interest levels persist.</p>
<p>As mentioned, the previous Open Interest ATH led to a sharp downswing for Bitcoin. During such price swings, a large amount of liquidations naturally occur.</p>

<p>Such liquidations, though, only feed further into the price move that caused them, thus elongating it. This then leads to even more liquidations, and the cycle continues.</p>
<p>This cascade of liquidations is known as a &#8220;<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-plunge-68000-squeezes-668-crypto-longs/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">squeeze</a>.&#8221; The latest price rally has also triggered massive amounts of liquidations, as shorts across the cryptocurrency sector have taken a $108 million beating.</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Liquidations" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-292989 aligncenter" height="296" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/table_b2a91e.png?w=557&#038;resize=557%2C296" width="557" /></p>

<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $71,500, up 5% over the last week.</p>

<title>All Crypto Lost? Binance Users Can’t Retrieve Funds After Philippines SEC Ban</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/all-crypto-lost-binance-users-cant-retrieve-funds-after-philippines-sec-ban/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/all-crypto-lost-binance-users-cant-retrieve-funds-after-philippines-sec-ban/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是正面的。文章讨论了菲律宾证券交易委员会对加密交易所币安的禁令，以及对未遵守规定的加密交易所的立场。SEC强调他们不是针对币安而是整体加密交易所，已经封禁了多个平台。受影响用户需要选择将资金转移到合规交易所或个人钱包。SEC强调他们已经给用户足够的时间提取资金。同时，币安和eToro尚未遵守菲律宾的规定。SEC设立创新办公室指导人们了解金融服务技术的风险和机遇。 <div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The recent ban on crypto exchange Binance has left many Filipino users wondering whether their holdings will be forever lost. In a recent interview, attorney Paolo Ong discussed the Philippines Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)’s decision to ban the exchange and how it has affected its users.</p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Binance Is Not Being “Singled Out”</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Paolo Ong, the officer in charge of the SEC’s PhiliFintech Innovation Office, <a href="https://youtu.be/oTXsO92nZJw?si=AVYmh5OD9y0W-UT7" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">joined</a> One News PH to explain the SEC’s ban on Binance and the regulator’s stance on crypto exchanges that don’t comply.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As Bitcoinist <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-users-philippines-face-access-restriction/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">reported</a>, the SEC banned Binance’s website and online services in the Philippines. The Filipino regulator requested assistance from the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) to “protect Filipino investors.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the recent events regarding the crypto exchange and its former CEO, Changpeng ‘CZ’ Zhao, the SEC had to look deeper into their investigation. The attorney explained that the regulator found it was “necessary to ban the platform.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, the SEC officer affirmed that the ban wasn’t an attempt to single out the largest exchange in the world. Instead, “this was a recurring enforcement action against these platforms.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">According to Ong, approximately 14 platforms were banned in 2023 in the Philippines, as such:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We’re not singling out Binance, and this is part of our exercise for a mandate in protecting Filipino investors.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Recently, the regulator <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/red-flag-for-etoro-philippines-investigates/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">warned</a> crypto trading platform eToro for not being registered as a corporation in the Philippines and lacking the required licenses to operate within the country.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Regarding eToro’s case, the SEC’s officer affirmed that it “is the same as Binance. They are not registered and are operating in the Philippines.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Filipino regulator is starting the notification period and trying to inform the public about the imminent fate of the country&#8217;s trading platform.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Can Filipino Binance Users Access Their Crypto?</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The attorney explained that the “grace period” for eToro users starts with the SEC’s notification process. Investors must choose whether to transfer their funds to one of the licensed and registered exchanges within the country or a personal wallet.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The officer was questioned about Binance users who didn’t withdraw their funds, as they find their holdings inaccessible now that the exchange is blocked by the internet service providers in the Philippines.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Ong considers that the crypto exchange users had sufficient time to withdraw their funds:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We issued the advisory last November. We gave a three-month period. Actually, we extended the period for people to take out their money or investments from the platform.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, the SEC officer affirmed that the regulator “can’t endorse any method” for investors to “take out their money now that the blocking order is out.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">According to the attorney, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/tether-dark-crown-used-stablecoin-illicit-crypto/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">crypto transactions</a> in the Philippines were around $80 billion in 2023. He emphasized that, due to the large numbers, the SEC is taking steps to protect Filipino investors by drafting their rules for cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, these regulations take time, as Ong explained, so:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">One approach the SEC did to address these innovations is to set up the innovation Office to guide people on the risks, as well as the opportunities in the kinds of technologies used in financial services.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">At the time of the interview, the SEC has not received any formal application from Binance or eToro to apply for a license. According to the attorney, they have not reached out to “do the right thing” and comply with the country’s regulations.</p>

<title>Crypto Funds Hit Highest Level Year-To-Date As $13.8 Billion Flows In, What’s Behind The Boom?</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-funds-hit-highest-level-year-to-date-as-13-8/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-funds-hit-highest-level-year-to-date-as-13-8/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。全球加密资金的年度流入达到了创纪录的138亿美元，显示投资者对数字资产的信心和兴趣越来越高。尤其是对比特币投资产品的需求增加，其中包括比特币交易所交易基金（ETF）。尽管以太坊基金面临流出，但其他数字货币如莱特币、索拉纳和文件币吸引了大量投资者。在地区上，美国、巴西、香港和德国的资金流入较高，而瑞士和加拿大则出现了资金流出。总体而言，这些迹象显示了加密货币作为合法投资资产被越来越多人接受和采用的趋势。 <div>
<p>So far, global crypto funds have soared to record annual inflows, reaching roughly $13.8 billion year-to-date as <a href="https://blog.coinshares.com/volume-177-digital-asset-fund-flows-weekly-report-b1855bff6f4e" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reported</a> by asset manager Coinshares.</p>
<p>This milestone marks a substantial increase in investor participation in the crypto market, highlighting growing confidence and interest in digital assets as a &#8220;viable&#8221; investment avenue.</p>
<p>Notably, the latest inflow figures also reveal an additional $646 million injected into crypto funds globally over the past week, further fueling the momentum of this trend.</p>

<h2>Rising Appetite For Crypto Investment Products</h2>
<p>The surge in inflows is attributed to heightened investor appetite for crypto investment products offered by prominent asset managers such as BlackRock, Bitwise, Fidelity, Grayscale, ProShares, and 21Shares.</p>
<p>These investment vehicles have witnessed substantial inflows, with investors allocating significant capital to gain exposure to various cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Of particular interest is the growing demand for Bitcoin<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/goldman-sachs-maintains-crypto-skepticism/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> investment products</a> such as spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which remain the focal point for many investors seeking exposure to the leading cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>While CoinShares Head of Research James Butterfill noted a decline in <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etf-issuer-vaneck-dives-stablecoin-market/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin spot ETF</a> flow levels compared to earlier in March, suggesting a possible stabilization in investor appetite, the influx of capital into global Bitcoin investment products has still managed to be quite notable.</p>
<p>Roughly $663 million was added to these vehicles in the past week alone. This underscores the enduring appeal of Bitcoin as a store of value and investment asset, attracting both institutional and retail investors alike.</p>
<p>Additionally, the strong performance of Bitcoin investment products reflects growing confidence in the long-term prospects of the cryptocurrency despite periodic market volatility.</p>
<img alt="Bitcoin (BTC) price chart on TradingView amid crypto news" height="1496" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/bSfEKJDz/" width="2770" />
<h2>Diversification And Regional Trends</h2>
<p>While Bitcoin continues dominating the crypto investment landscape, other digital assets have attracted significant investor interest.</p>
<p>Investment products tracking digital currency, such as Litecoin, Solana, and Filecoin, have experienced notable inflows, reflecting a broader trend of diversification within the digital currency investment space.</p>
<img alt="Crypto asset flows." class="wp-image-292961 size-large" height="660" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-08-at-16.24.47.png?resize=899%2C660" width="899" />
<p>However, Ethereum-based funds have faced outflows for the fourth consecutive week, indicating a divergence in investor sentiment toward different digital currencies.</p>
<p>Regionally, sentiment remains divided, with US-based funds witnessing substantial inflows alongside products in Brazil, Hong Kong, and Germany.</p>
<p>In contrast, Switzerland and Canada have experienced outflows, highlighting varying levels of investor confidence and market dynamics across different regions.</p>
<img alt="Crypto asset flows by country." class="wp-image-292963 size-large" height="584" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-08-at-16.26.30.png?resize=980%2C584" width="980" />
<p>Despite these regional disparities, the overall trend of record inflows underscores the growing mainstream acceptance and adoption of cryptocurrencies as legitimate investment assets.</p>
<p>In a further sign of institutional adoption, major financial institutions such as BlackRock and Morgan Stanley are expanding their presence in the crypto investment space.</p>

<p>BlackRock, for instance, has recently decided to add five new participants to its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) ETF, reflecting the growing demand for digital currency investment products among traditional financial institutions.</p>
<p>Similarly, Morgan Stanley plans to approve Bitcoin ETFs on its platform within the coming week,<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/morgan-stanley-bitcoin-etfs-2-weeks-insider/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> </a>signaling a notable milestone in integrating cryptocurrencies into traditional investment channels.</p>

<title>Victory For Do Kwon? Montenegro’s Latest Ruling Reverses Extradition To South Korea</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/do-kwon-latest-ruling-reverses-extradition/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/do-kwon-latest-ruling-reverses-extradition/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。在Montenegro的Do Kwon争取引渡案中，美国和韩国之间的拉锯战导致Montenegro最高法院推翻了他向韩国引渡的决定。Do Kwon被美国控以涉及TerraUSD稳定币崩溃的欺诈罪名。美国的努力导致他在纽约被控欺诈罪名，而Terraform Labs则获得了有利的裁决。现在，审判的决定已提交上诉，Terraform Labs的Luna Classic（LUNC）仍在交易中。 <div>
<p>Montenegro, caught in the crossfire of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/do-kwon-extradition-us-fights-on/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">extradition battles</a> between the United States and South Korea, has recently witnessed a significant turn of events in the case of disgraced crypto mogul Do Kwon. </p>
<p>After a Montenegrin appeal court rejected his extradition to the US, Montenegro&#8217;s Supreme Court overturned <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/extradition-denied-do-kwon-escapes-us-jurisdiction/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">earlier decisions</a> to extradite Kwon to South Korea, Bloomberg recently <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-08/us-bid-for-do-kwon-extradition-boosted-by-montenegro-court-ruling-crypto-in-dc" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reported</a>. </p>
<p>This development has bolstered US efforts to prosecute the former crypto mogul for fraud related to the collapse of the TerraUSD stablecoin in 2022. However, Do Kwon&#8217;s ultimate fate hangs in the balance as both the US and South Korea seek his extradition.</p>
<h2>Do Kwon&#8217;s Extradition Battle Takes A New Turn</h2>
<p>In mid-March, Bitcoinist <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/montenegro-orders-do-kwon-extradition-to-s-korea/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">reported</a> that a Montenegrin appeals court had rejected Kwon&#8217;s extradition to the United States but confirmed that South Korea&#8217;s extradition request took precedence over the US request. However, Montenegro&#8217;s Supreme Court overturned those earlier decisions, reviving US efforts to try Kwon on fraud charges. </p>
<p>Notably, the Supreme Court has stated that the country&#8217;s justice minister will eventually determine where Kwon will be handed over, pending a thorough examination of the extradition conditions.</p>

<p>Recent developments in the United States have further complicated Do Kwon&#8217;s situation. A federal jury in New York has found Kwon and his company, Terraform Labs, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/do-kwon-terraform-terraform-labs-liable-civil-charges/#:~:text=Kwon%2C%20who%20went%20into%20hiding,last%20year%20and%20awaits%20extradition." rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">liable </a>for defrauding investors who collectively invested billions of dollars into crypto assets that later plummeted in value. </p>
<p>The civil complaint, filed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in February 2023, alleged that Kwon and Terraform Labs engaged in a fraudulent scheme that resulted in a $40 billion loss of market value. </p>
<h2>Terraform Labs Challenges Verdict</h2>
<p>In response to the unfavorable verdict, Terraform Labs expressed disappointment and maintained that the evidence did not support the jury&#8217;s decision. </p>
<p>The company will evaluate its <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/do-kwon-extradition-takes-priority-in-40b-case/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">legal options</a> and next steps, including a potential appeal. Terraform had previously signaled its intention to challenge the SEC&#8217;s classification of its tokens as &#8220;securities.&#8221; </p>
<p>Kwon&#8217;s absence from the courtroom, which limited his ability to participate in the proceedings fully, may support the appeal. a Terraform spokesperson said in a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are very disappointed with the verdict, which we do not believe is supported by the evidence. We continue to maintain that the SEC does not have the legal authority to bring this case at all, and we are carefully weighing our options and next steps.</p></blockquote>

<p>Ultimately, this decision aligns with US efforts to prosecute Do Kwon for fraud charges related to the collapse of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/do-kwon-insider-terra-founders/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">TerraUSD stablecoin</a>. However, the outcome remains uncertain as Montenegro&#8217;s justice minister will decide where Do Kwon will be handed over, pending fulfilling the conditions for extradition. </p>
<img alt="Do Kwon " class="size-medium" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/vJVqAOTJ/" width="1814" />
<p>Terraform Labs&#8217; Luna token, renamed to Luna Classic (LUNC) after the collapse that triggered legal action against the company and its co-founder, is currently trading at $0.0001378. It has experienced a marginal 1% increase in the past 24 hours. However, over longer periods, the token has suffered losses of up to 28% in the past 30 days.</p>

<title>Paradigm Shift: Hard Data Shows Billions Flowing Into Solana, Ethereum Bleeding</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/billions-flowing-into-solana-ethereum-bleeding/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/billions-flowing-into-solana-ethereum-bleeding/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要: 这些信息是积极的。文章指出最新的链上数据显示，资金正从以太坊和BNB链转移至Solana等其他加密货币。Solana吸收了数十亿美元的资金，而以太坊可能继续走低。文章引入了Real Time Money Flow（RTMF）图表，表示资金流入或流出某一资产，指出以太坊可能在当前市场周期中努力获得收益。分析师称，随着竞争加剧，用户在其他加密货币中找到价值，以太坊可能会继续“受苦”。 Solana则面临着积极的情况，最近有大规模资本流入。希望Solana推出的牛市正在建立。FTX破产资产以64美元的价格出售了16亿美元的SOL令牌，并将其锁定四年。 <div>
<p>If recent on-chain data is anything to go by, then there is a paradigm shift among investors. According to the Real Time Money Flow (RTMF) <a href="https://twitter.com/martypartymusic/status/1776993867495030802" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">shared</a> by one analyst on X, capital is moving away from Ethereum and the BNB Chain. </p>
<p>On the other hand, other cryptocurrencies, such as Solana, are receiving a massive influx of capital. </p>
<h2>Solana Receiving Billions In Capital</h2>
<p>Some observers are now concerned that Ethereum, the leading smart contracts platform, might continue trending lower in the coming sessions as Solana, one of its top competitors, stretches gains, as the RTMF chart shows.</p>
<img alt="Real time money flow chart | Source: Analyst on X" class="size-full wp-image-292900" height="526" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GKkl8XYWIAAyIzT.jpg?resize=1024%2C526" width="1024" />
<p>Simply put, the RTMF chart visualizes money entering or leaving an asset. The tool gauges the buying or selling pressure behind every asset. Most importantly, it is a real-time indicator that doesn&#8217;t depend on historical parameters like prices or volume to print. </p>

<p>If crypto investors are interested in a particular asset, its RTMF will rise. On the other hand, if it is trending lower, like in the case of Ethereum and the BNB Chain, it might suggest a lack of interest or investors shifting to other assets. </p>
<p>As things stand, some analysts predict a bleak outlook for Ethereum in the current market cycle. Notable, they attribute this shift to a potential bias among long-time holders or even &#8220;heavy&#8221; investors. The cash migration towards Solana could be due to their value propositions. </p>
<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZbCQ6FUD/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Solana price trending sideways on the daily chart | Source: SOLUSDT on Binance, TradingView" class="size-full" height="848" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZbCQ6FUD/" width="1147" /></a>
<p>For instance, the Solana user base rapidly increases as protocol developers leverage the network&#8217;s scalability and low fees. On the other hand, Bitcoin has also seen a spike in its capital influx, primarily due to rising interest from institutions following the approval of spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January. </p>
<h2>Will Ethereum Labor For Gains This Cycle?</h2>
<p>One analyst <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/PeterLBrandt/status/1775973571896176785" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">argues </a>that Ethereum will likely continue to &#8220;suffer&#8221; in the coming months, especially as competition heats up and users find value in alternatives. </p>
<p>To support this assessment, the analyst said that despite Ethereum&#8217;s broad base and some users&#8217; confidence in its ability to become a store of value, it falls short of competing with Bitcoin. Moreover, Ethereum still struggles with high gas fees.</p>
<img alt="Ethereum price chart versus Bitcoin | Source: Analyst on X" class="size-full wp-image-292901" height="562" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GKWGaBfaoAA1w7q.jpg?resize=1024%2C562" width="1024" />
<p>Meanwhile, a bullish case is building for Solana. Last week, the FTX Bankruptcy Estate sold its $1.6 billion holding of SOL at $64 to crypto venture capitals Galaxy Digital and Pantera Capital. </p>

<p>These coins won&#8217;t be liquidated. Instead, they will be restaked and locked for four years.</p>

<title>Dogecoin Metrics See Bullish Reversal As DOGE Sets Sights On $0.3</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-doge-sights-on-0-3/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-doge-sights-on-0-3/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章指出，Dogecoin最近经历了价格波动，但现在投资者似乎寻求不同的方向。交易量激增，价格上涨，开盘利率增长，大额交易指示对DOGE的信心增强。数据显示，DOGE可能会继续走高至$0.30甚至更高。 whale Alert显示大量DOGE被大户收集。根据一个预测，DOGE有可能达到$12。 <div>
<p>Dogecoin is now looking to <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/dogecoin-2/dogecoin-rally-intensifies-eyes-set-on-historic-new-highs/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">write its price trajectory</a> for the rest of the month following an interesting series of price actions last week. The meme token saw its value fall from $0.2099 to $0.1689 last week, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin-deflates-whats-behind-the-20-price-drop-amidst-memecoin-mania/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">representing a fall of almost 20%</a> within the space of a few days.</p>
<p>However, it seems the DOGE investors are looking to move differently this week, as various on-chain metrics are starting to signal a full reversal into bullish momentum over the weekend.</p>
<h2>Dogecoin Trading Volume Spikes Amidst Price Appreciation</h2>
<p>Dogecoin has seen its trading volume skyrocketing recently amidst a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-price-600-rally-in-april-crypto-analyst/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">buildup of buying pressure</a>. According to <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/currencies/DOGE" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">data from Coinglass</a>, Dogecoin&#8217;s trading volume in the derivatives market has increased by 31% in the last 24 hours to over $4.61 billion. At the same time, data from <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dogecoin/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Coinmarketcap </a>shows a 13% increase in the spot market to reach $2.83 billion in the past 24 hours.</p>

<p>With volume comes buying pressure, and DOGE is seeing a lot of it. Interestingly, the increased buying has already driven the DOGE price up by over 6% in the last 24 hours $0.208. The number of DOGE long positions has also risen sharply, indicating traders expect the price to continue climbing. </p>
<h2>Surge In Open Interest</h2>
<p>Dogecoin <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-open-interest-ath/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">open interest</a> has seen a healthy rise of nearly 10.15% in the past 24 hours to $1.74 billion, indicating that more traders are opening new positions in DOGE. This rise in open interest signals that the bullish reversal seen in Dogecoin last week&#8217;s price decline may have enough momentum, as traders anticipate further gains throughout the week.</p>
<p>The majority ($574.95 million) of the open interest came from Binance. Bybit and Singapore-based BingX came in second and third, with $449.44 million and $229.42 million respectively. </p>
Whale Accumulation Signals Growing Confidence In DOGE
<p>On-chain data has shown a recent accumulation trend from DOGE whales, with large amounts of Dogecoins leaving crypto exchanges during the weekend. For example, Whale Alerts recently <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/dogecoin-2/dogecoin-whale-35-2-doge-binance-buying/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">noted the transfer</a> of 304 million Dogecoins worth $52.3 million from crypto exchange Binance into three private wallets. </p>
DOGE To $0.3?
<p>At the time of writing, DOGE is trading at $0.2076 after <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-7-year-cycle-40/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">hitting a bottom around $0.16</a> last week. Interestingly, the increase in the metrics mentioned coincided with DOGE attempting to break through the $0.20 resistance level during the weekend.</p>

<p>Now that the crypto has broken out of $0.20, the next target for the bulls is $0.22. If DOGE can close above $0.22 and hold the price level, many investors expect it to continue climbing to $0.30 and beyond. </p>
<p>According to a prediction, recent price action has seen the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-bullish-fractal-returns/">return of a bullish fractal</a> to DOGE. If history repeats itself, the bullish fractal could see DOGE surging to $12.</p>

<title>Binance Stunned: Bail Application Of Exec Tigran Gambaryan Denied, Nigerian Court Mandates Incarceration</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/nigerian-court-rejects-bail-for-binance-executive/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/nigerian-court-rejects-bail-for-binance-executive/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> 摘要：<br /><br />这些信息是消极的。<br />据报道，Binance的反洗钱合规主管Tigran Gambaryan在尼日利亚被羁押，面临5项洗钱指控。他否认指控并将于4月18日进行保释听证会。尼日利亚经济和金融犯罪委员会指控Binance和Gambaryan涉及在洗钱案中涉及3540万美元。此外，他们还面临涉嫌违反尼日利亚税收法的指控。这些事件凸显了加密公司在多个司法管辖区面临的法律挑战。此外，Binance Coin的交易价格为594美元，近30天增长超过21%。 <div>
<p>According to local media reports, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-executive-case-in-nigeria-postponed/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Tigran Gambaryan</a>, Binance&#8217;s Head of Financial Crimes Compliance, has been remanded in custody in Abuja, Nigeria. The Federal High Court in Abuja postponed the hearing of Gambaryan&#8217;s bail application for 11 days, with the remand order continuing until the bail hearing on April 18. </p>
<p>The judge, Emeka Nwite, agreed with the prosecution&#8217;s argument that the correctional center is the appropriate place to remand a defendant after an arraignment. Gambaryan was arraigned on five counts of money laundering.</p>
<h2>Tigran Gambaryan Pleads Not Guilty</h2>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/684302-alleged-money-laundering-court-sends-binance-executive-to-abuja-prison.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update </a>on the ongoing legal proceedings, Nigeria&#8217;s Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on March 28 charged Tigran Gambaryan and Binance with five counts of money laundering involving $35.4 million. </p>
<p>Notably, Gambaryan pleaded not guilty to these charges during the court session. The judge recorded a plea of not guilty for Binance based on the request of the prosecuting lawyer. </p>

<p>During the trial, Gambaryan&#8217;s lawyer, Mark Mordi, challenged the manner of service of the indictment, arguing that Binance, as a<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-denies-decision-making-detained-executive/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> legal entity</a>, should be served with the indictment in person or by substituted means for an arraignment to take place. </p>
<p>However, the judge ruled that Gambaryan&#8217;s refusal to accept service on behalf of Binance was unlawful, as both Gambaryan and his colleague Anjarwalla, who escaped from Nigerian authorities&#8217; custody, had signed an affidavit stating that they had been in Nigeria since February as representatives of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-establishes-first-ever-board-of-directors/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">crypto exchange </a>company.</p>
<p>The judge ordered Gambaryan&#8217;s remand at the Kuje Correctional Centre in Abuja until April 18, when his bail application will be heard and determined. </p>
<p>Gambaryan&#8217;s lawyer appealed for an earlier hearing or for his client to be detained by the EFCC, citing the extended period of detention and its impact on his well-being. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, the EFCC&#8217;s lawyer argued that remanding Gambaryan in the correctional center was the appropriate course of action, drawing parallels to Nigerians detained in foreign prisons during<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/hong-kong-crypto-exchange-shuts-down-unexpectedly/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> criminal trials</a>.</p>
<h2>Binance Accused Of Violating Nigerian Tax Laws</h2>
<p>In a separate case filed by Nigeria&#8217;s Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), Binance and its executives, including Gambaryan, are accused of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-executive-sues-nigerian-government/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">tax fraud</a>. </p>
<p>The charges include failure to register with the FIRS, failure to issue invoices for VAT purposes, failure to deduct value-added tax (VAT) arising from operations, and allegedly aiding subscribers to &#8220;unlawfully&#8221; neglect or refuse to pay taxes. These alleged offenses carry <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-houdini-binance-exec-escapes-from-nigerian-custody-amid-tax-evasion-charges-report/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">penalties </a>under relevant tax laws.</p>

<p>With the court postponing the bail hearing and setting a trial date, the case is expected to continue to unfold in the coming weeks. The charges against Gambaryan and Binance and the separate tax fraud case highlight the legal challenges facing crypto companies operating in multiple jurisdictions.</p>
<img alt="Binance" class="size-medium" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/pxl4wLBe/" width="1815" />
<p>Binance Coin&#8217;s (BNB) trading price currently stands at $594, reflecting a modest 1% increase over the past 24 hours. However, it is worth noting that the token has experienced significant growth of more than 21% in the last 30 days.</p>

<title>Coinbase Scores Knockout! Court Says Crypto Sales Aren’t Securities</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/coinbase-court-says-crypto-sales-arent-securities/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/coinbase-court-says-crypto-sales-arent-securities/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。最近美国法院对加密货币监管做出了一项混合裁决，对Coinbase等加密货币交易所和全国投资者都有影响。第二巡回上诉法院裁定，Coinbase上的二级销售不属于1934年证券交易法案。这对加密货币交易所是一大胜利，但没有消除所有关于加密货币的法律不确定性。裁决使Coinbase获得一定认可，但保留了一些法律不确定性，并强调了对加密货币市场的透明监管的迫切需求。 <div>
<p>A recent court decision in the United States has offered a mixed verdict for cryptocurrency regulation, with implications for both crypto exchanges like Coinbase and investors nationwide.</p>
<p>The US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that secondary sales of <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">cryptocurrencies</a> on Coinbase do not fall under the purview of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.</p>
<p>This victory for the crypto exchange brings some relief to the crypto industry, but doesn&#8217;t eliminate all the legal uncertainties surrounding cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-292868" height="552" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/a_8cff92.jpg?resize=575%2C552" width="575" /></p>

<h2><strong>Coinbase Wins Appeal On Secondary Sales</strong></h2>
<p>The lawsuit centered on whether the cryptocurrencies traded on the exchange qualified as securities. If classified as securities, they would be subject to stricter regulations under the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<p>A nationwide class of plaintiffs argued that Coinbase facilitated the unregistered sale and offering of securities through its platform, violating various regulations under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Coinbase, on the other hand, maintained that secondary crypto sales on their exchange did not meet the legal definition of securities transactions.</p>
<p>The Court of Appeals&#8217; decision provided some vindication for Coinbase. The court agreed that secondary sales on the platform weren&#8217;t securities under the Securities Exchange Act.</p>
<p>This is a significant win for Coinbase and crypto enthusiasts who participated in secondary trading on the platform between October 2019 and March 2022.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/Fh7lp2qE/" width="2475" /></p>

<h2><strong>Unresolved Issues Cloud The Verdict</strong></h2>
<p>However, the court&#8217;s decision wasn&#8217;t a complete victory for Coinbase. The court partially upheld a lower court ruling suggesting that Coinbase could still be liable under Section 12(a)(1) of the Securities Act for selling unregistered securities.</p>
<p>Another point of contention lies with Coinbase&#8217;s user agreements. The court acknowledged the changing nature of these agreements, which made it difficult to definitively assess their legal implications. This ambiguity creates uncertainty for both investors and the exchange itself.</p>
<strong>Lingering Debate And Need For Clarity</strong>
<p>The Court of Appeals&#8217; decision highlights the ongoing debate about how to regulate cryptocurrency in the US. While Coinbase interprets the verdict as confirmation that secondary crypto sales aren&#8217;t securities, the plaintiffs see it as a stepping stone towards enforcing securities laws on crypto platforms.</p>
<p>This difference in perspective underscores the need for clear and comprehensive regulations to govern the cryptocurrency market.</p>

<p>Both Coinbase and industry experts agree that a lack of clarity in regulations hinders innovation and growth in the crypto space. Paul Grewal, Coinbase&#8217;s Chief Legal Officer, emphasized the need for clear regulations in a recent X post.</p>
<p>He expressed hope that the court&#8217;s decision would pave the way for a constructive dialogue with regulators to establish a framework that fosters responsible innovation in the crypto industry.</p>
<p>The court&#8217;s decision offers some clarity on the classification of secondary crypto sales on Coinbase, but it doesn&#8217;t settle the broader issue of crypto regulation.</p>

<title>Shiba Inu Whale spends $19 Million On 692 Trillion SHIB, Time For Recovery?</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-692-trillion-shib/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-692-trillion-shib/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />近期，Shiba Inu加密货币价格波动，导致投资者兴趣下降。然而，大鲸鱼开始重新购买资产，其中一位购买了692万亿Shiba Inu。该大额交易引起了投资者的关注。交易显示资产从Crypto.com交易所购买，并转移到一个未知钱包，表明大鲸鱼正在积累资产。Shiba Inu价格开始回升，涨幅达2.5%，交易量增加超过20%，显示投资者对该币种的兴趣再次增加。 <div>
<p class="p2"><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-large-transactions-spike-over-1000/">Shiba Inu experienced a lull in its rally</a> over the past few weeks, causing investor interest to decline in the asset. However, this is beginning to change as investors, especially whales, are back to filling up their bags once again. The most notable of these buys is a whale who bought 692 trillion <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-major-exchange-listing/">SHIB</a> from the Crypto.com exchange.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Whale Spends $19 Million On Shiba Inu</h2>
<p class="p2">A significant Shiba Inu whale transaction was seen on the blockchain in the early hours of Monday and has caught investor attention over this time. The transaction which was reported by the on-chain whale tracking platform Whale Alert, was carrying a whopping 692.4 trillion <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-brink-of-crashing/">SHIB</a>.</p>

<p class="p2">Now, at the time of the transaction, the tranche of coins was worth around $19.26 million. But with the crypto market seeing upside ahead of the start of the trading week, this stash of coins has moved closer to to being worth $20 million at press time.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><img alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f6a8.png" style="height: 1em;" /> 692,400,000,000 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SHIB?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">#SHIB</a> (19,260,837 USD) transferred from <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CryptoCom?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">#CryptoCom</a> to unknown wallet<a href="https://t.co/EanzRBG2jj" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://t.co/EanzRBG2jj</a></p>
<p>— Whale Alert (@whale_alert) <a href="https://twitter.com/whale_alert/status/1777174174689050635?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">April 8, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p class="p2">When it comes to large transactions like these, their origination points, as well as the destination of the coins, can tell the reason behind the transaction. This way, it is easier to tell if the transaction will have a positive or negative impact on the price of the meme coin.</p>
<p class="p2">In this case, the prospects look positive as the coins were actually withdrawn from centralized exchange Crypto.com. This suggests that the whale had purchased the coins from the exchange. Then, looking at the destination, which is an unknown wallet, it shows that this <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-brink-of-crashing/">Shiba Inu investor</a> is moving their coins from the exchange to a personal wallet for safekeeping.</p>
<p class="p2">Accumulation is always a positive thing for any token, especially for the likes of Shiba Inu, As are whales choose to buy instead of sell, selling pressure decreases and demand goes up, which, in turn, causes the price of the meme coin to rise.</p>
<h2 class="p2">SHIB Starts Recovery Trend</h2>
<p class="p2">Amid the large buys, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-brink-of-crashing/">Shiba Inu price</a> has begun to see an upside. In the last day, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-large-transactions-spike-over-1000/">the meme coin’s price</a> is up 2.5%, with bulls gearing up to retest the resistance at $0.00002896. Additionally, there has been a more than 20% increase in its daily volume.</p>

<p class="p2">This <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/why-is-shiba-inu-price-down-today/">rise in daily volume</a> suggests that investors’ interest are turning back on the coin once again. Since the price is going up, it shows that there are currently more buyers than sellers and a continuation of this trend could kickstart a similar rally to what was seen in March. If that happens, then the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-major-exchange-listing/">SHIB</a> price could easily clear $0.00006 as a result.</p>

<title>Weekly Crypto Watchlist: Top Coins And Key Trends To Monitor</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />本文主要讨论了即将发生的一系列具有吸引力的故事和币种，可能重塑加密市场动态。著名的加密分析师Miles Deutscher和Layergg提供了关于即将成为头条的代币和趋势的深入分析。文章提到比特币、Solana、ORDI、ALT、Orion、Dogecoin等热门币种，分析表明它们在市场上的潜力和影响。此外，Layergg还提供了关于Ethena、Fantom、MANTLE、ANKR和Stargate等未被广泛关注的加密代币的见解。文章最后指出比特币的当前交易价格为$71,713。 <div>
<p>The week ahead presents a series of compelling narratives and coins that could potentially reshape crypto market dynamics. Renowned crypto analysts, Miles Deutscher and Layergg, have provided a granular outlook on the tokens and trends poised to make headlines. Here&#8217;s a deeper dive into their analyses:</p>
<h2>Bitcoin: On the Verge Of Breaking New Ground</h2>
<p>Miles Deutscher has underscored the resilience and bullish momentum of Bitcoin (BTC), which is inching closer to surpassing its all-time high. &#8220;The recovery post-dip has been exceptionally strong, and structurally, Bitcoin looks poised for significant gains. The previous high at $73.8k is the major resistance level to watch,&#8221; Deutscher notes. This sentiment reflects the growing investor confidence in Bitcoin as it continues to demonstrate strength in the face of market fluctuations.</p>
Solana: Overcoming Challenges
<p>Solana (SOL) has recently faced scrutiny due to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-existential-moment-co-founder-speaks-out/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">network congestion</a> issues, sparking debates about its scalability and reliability. However, Deutscher believes these challenges are temporary. &#8220;Like many of the previous SOL issues, I don&#8217;t think this will have any medium-long term impact. Solana, the biggest casino in the world, is well-positioned to continue its dominance,&#8221; he states, highlighting the network&#8217;s ability to bounce back from setbacks.</p>
ORDI: Bullish On The BRC-20/BTC Narrative Ecosystem
<p>ORDI stands out as a leader within the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-dogs-the-first-ever-brc-20-ico-launches-today/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">BRC-20</a>/BTC narrative ecosystem, according to Deutscher. With the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/here-are-the-top-crypto-predictions-following-the-bitcoin-halving-in-april-2024/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">halving</a> event only 12 days away, he observes a surprisingly quiet market narrative, which he finds uncharacteristic given the rarity and significance of such events. &#8220;I&#8217;m still bullish on BRC plays into the halving, with ORDI being a leader. Despite the quiet, the potential for significant market movement is palpable,&#8221; Deutscher asserts.</p>
ALT: Anticipation Builds Around EigenLayer Airdrop
<p>The crypto community is abuzz with speculation about the impending EigenLayer airdrop, and ALT is at the center of this excitement due to its close relationship with Eigen itself. &#8220;There have been some recent rumors around the EigenLayer airdrop being quite close, and the market will need betas heading into it. I like ALT, given its close relationship to Eigen itself, and that it&#8217;s also within the restaking narrative, which is likely to receive a subsequent boost,&#8221; Deutscher explains.</p>

<p>Recently, BitMEX founder Arthur Hayes&#8217; has hinted at an upcoming Eigenlayer Token Generation Event (TGE). &#8220;Altlayer is a leading Eigen-beta with a &#8216;Restaked Rollup narrative&#8217;. ALT stakers are highly likely to receive airdrops of EIGEN and XTER,&#8221; Layergg added, emphasizing the potential rewards for early supporters.</p>
Orion (ORN): Pioneering Exposure To EigenLayer
<p>Orion, soon to be rebranded to $LUMIA, has caught Deutscher&#8217;s attention as the first restaking rollup on EigenLayer. &#8220;There aren&#8217;t many ways you can get exposure to EigenLayer pre-launch, hence why they&#8217;re on my radar. They&#8217;re also rebranding to $LUMIA, and the market has taken well to rebrands in recent weeks,&#8221; he comments, indicating the strategic importance of rebranding in the crypto sector.</p>
Dogecoin (DOGE): Speculative Surge Ahead Of Doge Day
<p>Dogecoin&#8217;s performance leading up to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-community-doge-day/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Doge Day</a> on April 20th is a focal point for traders and investors alike. &#8220;DOGE has done well in recent years leading up to that day, as people begin speculating that Elon may tweet. Looking for strength, it may be a decent trade if an entry presents,&#8221; Deutscher mentions, pointing to the speculative nature of this annual event.</p>
Lesser-Known Crypto Altcoins To Watch
<p>Furthermore, Layergg has provided additional insights into crypto tokens and narratives that could shape the market this week:</p>
<p><strong>Ethena (ENA):</strong> Layergg highlights ENA&#8217;s impressive performance and strategic expansion. &#8220;Ethena has not only achieved the highest returns among major dApps over the last 7 days, with $8M in earnings, but has also significantly increased its TAM with BTC collateral acceptance.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Fantom (FTM):</strong> With its &#8220;horizontal scaling&#8221; narrative, Fantom is poised to benefit from Solana&#8217;s recent issues. &#8220;Andre Cronje&#8217;s comments on the upcoming &#8216;Sonic upgrade&#8217; and a &#8216;bigger target&#8217; for the summer underscore Fantom&#8217;s ambitious roadmap,&#8221; Layergg notes.</p>
<p><strong>MANTLE:</strong> The promise of high returns for $MNT stakers, combined with the ATH in the price of $PUFF following an airdrop, highlights Mantle&#8217;s growing appeal. &#8220;Mantle&#8217;s TVL and holders are reaching new ATHs daily, acting as a catalyst for upward momentum,&#8221; the crypto analyst observes.</p>
<p><strong>ANKR:</strong> The anticipation of an important announcement at &#8220;Stability World AI&#8221; has put ANKR in the crypto spotlight. &#8220;The utility of the $ANKR token is being reevaluated due to Neura, highlighting its innovative approach to combining AI, dePIN, BTC LST, and RaaS,&#8221; Layergg comments.</p>
<p><strong>Stargate (STG):</strong> The imminent launch of Stargate V2 and its position as the leading bridge signals a reevaluation of interoperability projects&#8217; value. &#8220;The competition with Wormhole $W is causing a reevaluation of the value of interoperability projects, with STG leading the charge,&#8221; Layergg states.</p>
<p>At press time, BTC traded at $71,713.</p>

<title>Will He Be Right? Ripple CEO Predicts Crypto Market to Hit $5 Trillion</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-ceo-crypto-market-to-hit-5-trillion/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。根据区块链公司Ripple的首席执行官Brad Garlinghouse的预测，加密市场可能即将迎来一次重大繁荣，加密市场总值预计可在2024年达到5万亿美元。ETFs的推出被视为加密行业的重大变革，而比特币减半事件可能导致价格上涨。然而，监管仍然是一个挑战，尽管投资者的信任和进一步投资可能获得的情况下，清晰且一致的法规将对这一行业产生积极影响。 <div>
<p>The crypto market could be on the cusp of a major boom, according to Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of blockchain company Ripple.</p>

<p>In an interview with CNBC, Garlinghouse predicted that the total <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">market capitalization</a> of the crypto market could double by the end of 2024, reaching a staggering $5 trillion.</p>
<blockquote>
“I’ve been around this industry for a long time, and I’ve seen these trends come and go,” Garlinghouse said. “I’m very optimistic. I think the macro trends, the big picture things like the ETFs, they’re driving for the first time real institutional money.”
</blockquote>
<p>This bullish outlook hinges on several key factors, including the recent arrival of the first <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-bank-of-america-now-offer-bitcoin-etfs/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">US spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds</a> (ETFs) and the upcoming bitcoin halving event.</p>





The <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">total market capitalization</a> of cryptocurrencies, as of the latest available data, is approximately $2.59 trillion. This figure represents the combined value of all digital assets in the market.











<strong style="color: #212121; font-size: 1.953em;">Crypto Embraces Wall Street</strong>




<p>The introduction of ETFs is seen as a game-changer for the crypto industry. These investment vehicles allow traditional institutions and retail investors to gain exposure to bitcoin without the complexities of directly owning and storing the digital currency. This influx of institutional money could provide much-needed stability and legitimacy to the often-volatile bitcoin market.</p>
<h2><strong>Bitcoin Halving: A Supply Squeeze?</strong></h2>
<p>The bitcoin halving, slated for later this month, is another factor fueling optimism. This event, which occurs roughly every four years, cuts the reward given to miners for verifying bitcoin transactions.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="571" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/l7uNVZnk/" width="1281" /></p>

<p>This reduction in supply, coupled with potentially steady or even rising demand, could theoretically push the price of bitcoin upwards. Historically, bitcoin halvings have been followed by price surges, although past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.</p>
<strong>Regulatory Hurdles Remain</strong>
<p>Despite Garlinghouse&#8217;s optimism about the regulatory landscape, challenges persist. The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has taken a cautious approach to regulation, with ongoing<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-labs-case-ceo-slams-sec-remarks/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> legal battles against several companies</a>, including Ripple itself.</p>
<p>The SEC&#8217;s stance under its chairman, Gary Gensler, has focused on protecting investors, but it has also created uncertainty for the industry.</p>
<p>While Garlinghouse believes the US government could adopt a more accommodating stance towards crypto in light of the upcoming elections, the regulatory picture remains unclear.</p>
<p>Clear and consistent regulations would be a boon for the industry, fostering trust and encouraging further investment.</p>

<strong>The Road Ahead For Crypto</strong>
<p>Despite the inherent risks, the overall outlook for the crypto market appears cautiously optimistic. The influx of institutional money via ETFs, coupled with potential price increases due to the bitcoin halving, could propel the market to new heights.</p>

<title>Crypto Expert Says Bitcoin Price Is Set To Double, Here’s Why</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-price-set-to-double/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-price-set-to-double/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章中提到了一名加密货币分析师预测比特币价格将在未来几个月内翻倍。分析人士还揭示了比特币价格显示的罕见技术模式，预示着可能在2024年价格翻倍至约14万美元。此外，文章还涵盖了即将到来的比特币减半事件，并对市场状况进行了深入分析，表明当前市场表现良好，但存在一定风险。 <div>
<p>A crypto analyst has forecasted that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-screams-huge-opportunity-gold-high/">Bitcoin</a>, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, will double in price in the coming months. </p>
<h2>Bitcoin Price Displays Rare Technical Pattern</h2>
<p>In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, a crypto analyst and Bitcoin enthusiast identified as ‘TechDev’ <a href="https://x.com/techdev_52/status/1776964413603332417?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">disclosed</a> a rare <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/when-bitcoin-top-historical-pattern-provide-hints/">technical pattern</a> observed in BTC&#8217;s price movements. Sharing a price chart illustrating Bitcoin’s <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-november-finale-seen-by-historical-numbers/">historical price fluctuations</a> since 2011, TechDev unveiled a distinct correlation in the cryptocurrency’s price movements across 2013, 2017 and 2022.</p>

<p>According to the analyst, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-price-nears-all-time-high-5-key-factors/">Bitcoin’s price</a> during these years had closed two consecutive months over the upper <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bollinger-bands-creator-bitcoin-downtrend-might-be-over/">Bollinger bands</a>. He revealed that previously when this happened, the price of BTC had doubled within three months from its initial price value. </p>
<p>Based on his analysis of this rare technical indicator, TechDev disclosed that a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/historical-bull-run-pattern-finally-forming-bitcoin/">similar pattern was showing up for BTC&#8217;s price</a> in 2024. This suggests that the cryptocurrency may see its price doubling to almost $140,000 by July 2024. </p>
<p>At the time of writing, the price of Bitcoin is trading at $69,740, reflecting a 0.57% increase over the past 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. The cryptocurrency has been on a notable uptrend since the beginning of the year, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-price-surges-to-new-all-time-high-is-100000-in-sight/">reaching new all-time highs</a> well before the anticipated Bitcoin halving this April.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-primed-to-clear-71500-and-rally-again/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">BTC&#8217;s price trajectory on a steady momentum</a> and capturing the attention of the broader crypto community, this latest forecast adds more fuel to the growing hype and <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-sentiment-extreme-greed-btc-71000/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">bullish sentiment</a> surrounding the cryptocurrency. </p>
<h2>Countdown To The Halving Event</h2>
<p>Popular crypto analyst, Ali Martinez, has <a href="https://x.com/ali_charts/status/1776754312796086656?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">begun a countdown</a> to the highly anticipated <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/when-is-the-next-btc-halving-date-bitcoin-halving-guide/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Bitcoin halving event</a> set for April 2024. Expressing optimism about the 4-year Bitcoin supply cut, Martinez revealed that there were less than two weeks left until the halving event kicked in. </p>

<p>During this period, the block rewards for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-halving-havoc-only-a-few-miners-may-survive/">BTC miners</a> will be cut in half, reducing the rate at which new coins are created and thus decreasing the supply and potentially increasing the value of the cryptocurrency. </p>
<p>Santiment reports have <a href="https://x.com/santimentfeed/status/1777087172786713020?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">revealed</a> a strong inclination that the market’s current elevated performance may likely continue up until the halving event. </p>
<p>Conversely, Martinez disclosed that selling pressures could take hold of the current market if Bitcoin witnessed an upswing to $70,190. He projected around $33 million in liquidations across derivatives exchanges if BTC rises to the aforementioned target. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the crypto analyst noted a significant rise in sellers during Bitcoin’s recent dip below $70,000. <a href="https://x.com/ali_charts/status/1777134454420439063?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Predicting</a> a potential rebound to $70,875, he anticipates approximately $72 million in liquidations.</p>

<title>By The Numbers: How Will Bitcoin Mining Costs Change Post-Halving?</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/by-numbers-how-bitcoin-mining-costs-post-halving/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/by-numbers-how-bitcoin-mining-costs-post-halving/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。文章讨论了比特币减半以及对矿工机器的底价影响。随着比特币减半在约11天内到来，矿工的成本将翻倍，使一些矿工的机器成本高于挖掘收入。不过，当前的比特币牛市使得有些矿工机器仍能保持盈利，但大部分的机器会面临越来越大的经济压力。 <div>
<p>With the Bitcoin halving coming soon, miner expenses are about to change. Here&#8217;s, in numbers, how the floor prices would stand for popular rigs.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Halving And Its Influence On Floor Prices Of Mining Machines</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-difficulty-drops-miners-expand-halving/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">halving</a> is a periodic event on the Bitcoin network where the block rewards received by the miners for successfully solving a block are permanently cut in half. This event automatically goes through every 210,000 blocks, or approximately every four years.</p>
<p>The reason the halving exists is that the block rewards serve as the only way to introduce new BTC tokens into circulation, so by periodically slashing them in half, the cryptocurrency&#8217;s production rate can be diminished, and thus, its <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-btc-leading-indicator-cpi-inflation/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">inflation</a> can be controlled.</p>

<p>Supply-demand dynamics dictate that the rarer is an asset, the higher should be its value. The halving ensures that Bitcoin becomes scarcer with each event, as only half the amount enters into the supply following it.</p>
<p>The next halving is set to go live in about 11 days, meaning that the supply is about to be tightened further. The current block reward for the cryptocurrency stands at 6.25 BTC, so it will go to 3.125 BTC following the halving.</p>
<p>While the halving is positive for the asset in terms of its economics (at least on paper), its existence is troublesome for miner financials. This is because of the fact that the block rewards usually make up the majority of the miners&#8217; income.</p>
<p>In a new <a href="https://twitter.com/ki_young_ju/status/1777242916098101587" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, CryptoQuant founder and CEO Ki Young Ju has discussed about how the BTC halving is about to change mining floor prices.</p>
<p>The below chart shows the trend in the floor prices for some of the popular mining rigs on the market:</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Mining Cost" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="1146" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GKn-bfqakAAl9H2?format=jpg&amp;name=large" width="1628" /></p>

<p>As displayed in the above graph, the Antminer S19 currently has a floor price of $54,900, meaning that the miners who have these rigs installed in their farms would only break-even when the BTC price is at $54,900.</p>
<p>The S19 XP, which is common among US-based miners, has a floor price of $40,000 right now. The efficient S21 is currently the most profitable at $27,900. As mentioned before, though, these are about to change with the halving.</p>
<p>The costs would double for all of these miners, with the users of the popular S19 XP going underwater, with their cost of production jumping to $80,000. It would also be even worse for the S19 owners, who will only break even with the price at $109,800.</p>

<p>Those who invested in the latest Antminer S21, though, would still remain in profit, with their floor price hitting just $55,800. Nonetheless, It may sound bleak that besides S21 miners, the rest are about to go underwater. This is, however, nothing new for the industry.</p>
<p>As the chart below shows, the 2020 halving put the S9 owners into red. This underwater status continued for a while for these miners, but with the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/why-dogecoin-price-could-see-bull-rally/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">bull rally</a>, the price surged enough to more than make up for the halved rewards.</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin 2020 Halving" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="1114" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GKn-cy3bQAAXvlT?format=jpg&amp;name=large" width="1558" /></p>

<p>In fact, this time around, the situation is undoubtedly better for the miners, as Bitcoin is already in the middle of a bull run. With only an 11% growth from the current spot price, the S19 Pro miners would hit the post-halving break-even level.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $72,100, up more than 3% over the past week.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Gives Mixed Signals: Here Are Key Events To Watch Out For This Week</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-key-events-this-week/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-key-events-this-week/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。比特币价格暂时跌破心理关口，可能会继续波动。有观点认为比特币减半前的回调已结束，但仍存在可能的价格调整。鲸鱼活动将影响市场情绪，并显示减半事件阶段。ETF和衍生品市场的跟踪记录也将影响市场情绪。具有指示价值的大额资金可能流入比特币信托基金。市场波动可能导致大量头寸被清算，有可能帮助多头重新掌控市场。 <div>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC) is <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin-blasts-past-70000-in-wild-week-to-register-new-all-time-high/#:~:text=Bitcoin%20Blasts%20Past%20%2470%2C000%20In,Register%20New%20All%2DTime%20High&amp;text=The%20price%20of%20bitcoin%20has,wave%20of%20enthusiasm%20among%20investors." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">back below $70,000</a> after momentarily rising above this psychological price range on April 7. This price action suggests that the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crash-10-69000/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">bears are still in control</a>, which could remain the case throughout this week. As the tug of war continues, here are some key events to watch out for. </p>
<h2>Is The Pre-Halving Retrace Over?</h2>
<p>Crypto analyst Rekt Capital <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-troubles-far-from-over/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">previously highlighted</a> the phases of the Bitcoin Halving, including the pre-halving retrace. He noted that Bitcoin’s price usually drops 28 to 14 days before the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bull-market-glassnode/">Halving event</a>. With the halving event about 12 days away, there is the belief that the pre-halving retrace is over. </p>

<p>However, considering that the cycle has already proven unique, especially with BTC hitting a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-breaks-through-69000-setting-new-record/">new all-time high (ATH)</a> before the Halving, investors will undoubtedly be wary about the flagship crypto making one last price correction this week. In one of his recent X (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/rektcapital/status/1775890683553079391" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">posts</a>, Rekt Capital also admitted that it is still uncertain whether or not the bottom is in. </p>
<p>Whale activity this week will also give an idea of the current sentiment in the market as the Halving event draws near. <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-whales-buying-spree/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Significant purchases</a> of the flagship crypto suggest that Bitcoin investors believe the worst is over and are already positioning themselves for a potential parabolic price surge once the Halving occurs. </p>
<p>If whales signal a bullish sentiment, that also means that the market has likely moved to the next Halving phase, which, according to Rekt Capital, is the “Re-accumulation” phase. On the other hand, a wave of BTC sell-offs this week will strengthen the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-troubles-far-from-over/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">bearish narrative</a> currently plaguing BTC and suggest that the pre-halving retrace bottom isn’t in yet. </p>
<h2>Spot Bitcoin ETFs And The Derivatives Market</h2>
<p>The net flows the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/these-new-spot-bitcoin-etfs-now-hold-nearly-of-btc/#:~:text=Notably%2C%20these%20nine%20US%20spot,%2C%20and%20VanEck%20(HODL).">Spot Bitcoin ETFs</a> record this week will also be critical in determining the current market sentiment. They have experienced <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-whale-profits-mixed-spot-btc-etf-flows/">mixed flows</a> in the last two weeks, something which has given a more bearish than bullish outlook considering the amount of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etfs-record-2-2-billion-inflow-in-past-week/">net inflows</a> they were recording before now. </p>

<p>However, things could again pick up this week with BlackRock <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-broadens-reach/">expanding</a> the list of authorized participants for its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) last week. These participants include notable names like <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/goldman-sachs-maintains-crypto-skepticism/">Goldman Sachs</a>, Citadel, and Citigroup. Therefore, a significant amount of new money could flow into the IBIT ETF this week. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the crypto community will be watching the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-derivatives-market-volumes-show-bullish-trend-after-2022-downturn/">derivatives market</a> as, depending on market volatility, many positions could be wiped out this week. Crypto analyst Ali Martinez recently <a href="https://x.com/ali_charts/status/1777134454420439063" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">revealed</a> that nearly $72 million could be liquidated if Bitcoin rebounds to $70,875. If that happens, it could be the first step in helping the bulls regain control over the market. </p>

<title>Expert Addresses Conspiracy Theories, Affirms Ripple’s Stance Against XRP Dumping</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/expertaffirms-ripple-stance-against-xrp-dumping/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/expertaffirms-ripple-stance-against-xrp-dumping/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的<br />澳大利亚知名律师和企业家Bill Morgan就有关XRP的抛售是否操纵或压制其价格的猜测进行了详细解答，并强调了加密资产管理中的透明度。文章还讨论了关于Ripple的抛售对XRP价格的影响，并澄清了一些人士的指责，指出Ripple的行为主要受整个加密货币市场的影响。文章还介绍了Jed McCaleb的抛售行为及对XRP价格的影响。总体来说，文章为XRP的价格变动提供了合理的解释，并认为一些人士对Ripple的指责是缺乏根据的。 <div>
<p>Bill Morgan, a well-known Australia-based lawyer and entrepreneur has delved into speculations regarding <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-emerge-tether-upcoming-stablecoin-launch/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ripple</a> dumping of XRP to manipulate or suppress its price, debunking the claims and emphasizing transparency in the crypto asset&#8217;s management.</p>
<h2>No Proof To Back Up Claims Against Ripple</h2>
<p>Morgan&#8217;s <a href="https://x.com/Belisarius2020/status/1777091421113291106" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">insights</a> on the subject were triggered by a pseudonymous X user noting that several people in the crypto community are going about claiming that Ripple&#8217;s dumping of XRP is a &#8220;conspiracy theory,&#8221; while calling on the lawyer to confirm these allegations.</p>

<p>Initially, the X user&#8217;s comment came in light of Onledger&#8217;s <a href="https://x.com/DreadDozer/status/1777041992758809081" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> concerning the distribution of XRP over the course of five years, particularly between 2019 to 2024. Onledger highlighted that within 5 years, the overall amount of distributed XRP (all XRP not owned by Ripple) has grown from 41.1 billion XRP to 55.05 billion XRP.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, during the aforementioned period, about 14 billion XRP was brought to the crypto market, primarily by Ripple, but also by the payment company&#8217;s co-founder and Stellar creator Jed McCaleb. It is worth noting that since 2014, Jed McCaleb was found dumping <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-wont-make-you-rich/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">XRP</a>, following the $9 billion in recompense he received for his work at the firm.</p>
<p>As a member of the founding team of Ripple in 2012, while it was still known as OpenCoin, McCaleb received a portion of the 20 billion XRP that was given to himself and the other two founders, Chris Larsen and Arthur Britto.</p>
<p>Rather than instantly selling all of his tokens after splitting from Ripple in 2013, McCaleb was compelled to unload them over an extended period of time. Specifically, an address identified as &#8220;Tacostand&#8221; which was linked to McCaleb was found responsible for the persistent selling pressure of the digital asset.</p>
<p>However, the selling pressure brought about by &#8220;Tacostand&#8221; had less of an effect on the price of XRP, or at least that was the purpose of the contract between Ripple and McCaleb.</p>
<p>Responding to the X user, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bill-morgan-refutes-xrp-listing-on-coinbase/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bill Morgan</a> clarified his position, asserting that he had never said it was a conspiracy theory. According to Morgan, Ripple selling a significant amount of XRP into the market can naturally impact prices negatively in the same way as producers of oil may negatively impact prices by raising supply, provided that demand stays the same. </p>
<h2>XRP Price Movement Follows The Broader Market</h2>
<p>Morgan underscored statements suggesting that this is the main cause of the change in the price of XRP, which has been the subject of his criticism. This is because there is no available evidence to prove this was the major objective behind the price decline.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Ripple case provides proof that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-price-to-hit-3-4-crypto-expert-reveals-when/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">XRP&#8217;s price</a> moves in tandem with the wider crypto market, particularly with respect to changes in the prices of Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC).</p>

<p>Thus, Morgan has flagged the subject as fudding since some people claim that Ripple is surpressing XRP&#8217;s value by dumping coins. He further highlights the fact that these people either purposefully or unintentionally ignore the numerous reasons why this is false.</p>

<title>Cardano Set For Boost With Two Major Upgrades, Says Hoskinson</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-two-major-upgrades-hoskinson/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-two-major-upgrades-hoskinson/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />查尔斯·霍金森宣布了两个重要升级的计划，旨在加强Cardano网络生态系统。这显示了Cardano对可扩展性、治理和创新的战略准备，并展望了充满希望的未来。霍金森强调了Cardano的强大社区和持续发展的重要性。即将推出的Cardano Chang将重塑区块链治理，Ouroboros Leios将推动网络的可扩展性和效率，引入了革命性的交易验证模型。霍金森指出这些升级的重要性，并强调了Cardano在面对行业怀疑时的稳定性和社区支持。ADA当前交易价格为0.606美元。 <div>
<p>In a rebuff to detractors of the Cardano network and its native token, Charles Hoskinson has announced the soon release of two significant upgrades designed to bolster the blockchain ecosystem profoundly. Through a <a href="https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1777037687653892128" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">statement</a> made on X, Hoskinson paints a picture of a future brimming with promise for Cardano, underscoring its strategic preparedness for scalability, governance, and innovation.</p>
<p>The narrative surrounding Cardano&#8217;s pace of development and its standing in the crypto ecosystem has once again faced scrutiny and skepticism. However, Charles Hoskinson has emerged with a message of resilience and strategic foresight.</p>
<p>On April 7, amidst a backdrop of critique, Hoskinson articulated a blend of amusement and conviction, asserting, &#8220;Seeing all the dunking on Cardano makes me smile a bit. We are holding all the cards as an ecosystem. We have the best path for scalability, governance, and innovation. We also have the best community. Chang is coming soon as measured by progress on <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-king-of-development/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">SanchoNet</a>.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Cardano Chang: Redefining Blockchain Governance</h2>
<p>The Chang <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-catastrophe-key-eip-needed-hard-fork/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">hard fork</a>, anticipated to take place in the second quarter, represents a huge step towards decentralization and community-run governance within the ADA ecosystem. This upgrade will enable ADA holders to actively participate in shaping the network&#8217;s future, marking a significant evolution in blockchain governance.</p>

<p>Chang aims to introduce a framework for on-chain community consensus, laying the groundwork for a more democratic and participatory governance model. This includes the introduction of Delegate Representatives (DReps), a Cardano Constitution Convention, and a pivotal community vote on the Cardano Constitution, setting the stage for a fully decentralized governance mechanism.</p>
Ouroboros Leios: Setting New Benchmarks In Scalability
<p>In parallel to the governance overhaul, ADA is on the cusp of a major technological advancement with the Ouroboros Leios update. Aimed at dramatically enhancing the network&#8217;s scalability and efficiency, this protocol update introduces a revolutionary model for transaction validation and block production.</p>
<p>By delineating these responsibilities among distinct node types, Ouroboros Leios is set to significantly amplify the network&#8217;s transaction throughput and processing capacity.</p>

<p>Hoskinson underscores the transformative potential of Ouroboros Leios, remarking, &#8220;Ouroboros Leios is the biggest step forward towards solving the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/breaking-down-the-scalability-trilemma/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">blockchain trilemma</a> ever. Our research labs are scaling up, we are now at 209 papers with much faster research translation.&#8221;</p>
Navigating Industry Skepticism
<p>The anticipation of these upgrades comes at a time when Cardano has been juxtaposed with several burgeoning blockchain projects. Hoskinson, however, remains steadfast, drawing analogies with the broader tech industry&#8217;s evolutionary challenges and stressing the foundational robustness and communal solidarity that underpin <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-founder-declares-crypto-under-attack/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Cardano&#8217;s ethos</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;AI has the same issue. A few months ago, Open AI dominated everything, then Claude 3, now we got Grok 1.5, and soon Llama 3. The winners have foundations that are built to last generations and a community that respects and maintains those foundations. There is no substitution for this reality,&#8221; Hoskinson elucidated, drawing parallels between the ephemeral narratives in tech and the enduring nature of foundational innovation.</p>
<p>At press time, ADA traded at $0.606.</p>
<img alt="Cardano ADA price" class="size-full wp-image-292797" height="472" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ADAUSD_2024-04-08_10-47-23.png?resize=1024%2C472" width="1024" />

<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-292786" height="556" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/a_262e3a.jpg?resize=1000%2C556" width="1000" /></p>

<strong>Hong Kong&#8217;s Progressive Approach Wins Praise</strong>
<p>While acknowledging the challenges posed by the evolving regulatory landscape in the United States, Wood lauded Hong Kong&#8217;s progressive approach to crypto regulation.</p>
<p>She commended the Securities and Futures Commission for its comprehensive framework for virtual asset trading.</p>
<p>Wood specifically highlighted Hong Kong&#8217;s transparency and leadership in fostering innovative technologies as a model for other regions.</p>

<strong>A Web3 Future?</strong>
<p>According to Cathie Wood, there will be a bright future for Web3 with a legislative climate that encourages innovation and institutional adoption. As a result, Bitcoin may achieve unprecedented levels of success in the entertainment, e-commerce, and financial industries around the world.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there are obstacles on the way forward, such as the inherent volatility of the cryptocurrency market and the lack of clarity surrounding regulations.</p>
<strong>Uncertainties Remain</strong>
<p>Wood recognizes that there are obstacles, despite her confidence. Worldwide regulatory frameworks are in a constant state of flux, and unanticipated rules have the potential to hinder Web3&#8217;s global reach and innovation.</p>
<p>Additionally, it is unclear how accurate cryptocurrency industry long-term price forecasts, such as Wood&#8217;s Bitcoin goal of $1.5 million by 2030, actually are.</p>

<title>XRP Has Legal Clarity No Matter What: Lawyer Clears Up FUD</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-legal-clarity-lawyer-fud/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-legal-clarity-lawyer-fud/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。律师Bill Morgan提供了关于XRP法律地位的详细解释，驱散了社区和加密市场中存在的恐惧、不确定性和疑虑（FUD）。文章分析了XRP社区和加密市场存在的三个主要FUD故事：Ripple分发XRP抑制了代币价格的指控；关于XRP在Torres法官裁决后的法律清晰度问题；以及担忧拟议的稳定币可能稀释对XRP需求的问题。Morgan指出，虽然法院明确裁定XRP本身不是证券，但对某些销售可能使代币成为证券的说法缺乏法律先例支持。他强调了与最近法院裁决相关的混淆，阐明了Ripple案与其他案例之间的重要区别，强调了每个加密案例都取决于其特定的事实和情况。最后，Morgan敦促社区和更广泛的加密行业认识到每个法律案例的独特性，强调了XRP的法律清晰度已经得到确认，是时候摆脱FUD，专注于前进的道路了。在最新的报道中，XRP报价为0.59美元。 <div>
<p>In an effort to dispel fears, uncertainties, and doubts (FUD) that have permeated the XRP community and the broader crypto market, lawyer Bill Morgan, recently provided comprehensive <a href="https://twitter.com/Belisarius2020/status/1776946945564844453" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">insights </a>into the legal standing of XRP. Morgan&#8217;s comments came in the wake of various court decisions that have cast a shadow over the crypto industry, with significant rulings against entities like Coinbase and Terraform Labs drawing particular attention.</p>
<h2>Dissecting The XRP FUD</h2>
<p>Morgan delineates three primary narratives of FUD that have persistently troubled the community:</p>
<ol>
<li>The allegation that Ripple&#8217;s distribution of XRP has suppressed the token&#8217;s price.</li>
<li>The question of XRP&#8217;s legal clarity post-Judge Torres&#8217; ruling.</li>
<li>Concerns over the proposed stablecoin potentially diluting demand for XRP.</li>
</ol>
<p>Focusing specifically on the second point, Morgan argues against the notion that XRP lacks legal clarity. &#8220;Despite the court&#8217;s clear finding that XRP itself is not a security, some continue to wrongly assert that certain sales could render the token a security,&#8221; Morgan states, emphasizing the absence of legal precedent for such an argument.</p>

<p>Morgan specifically addresses the confusion stemming from recent judicial decisions. He contrasts the SEC&#8217;s allegations against Coinbase and Solana with the case against Ripple, suggesting that misconceptions have arisen from the broader community&#8217;s misinterpretation of these separate legal proceedings.</p>
<p>&#8220;The misunderstanding lies in conflating the nuances of different cases,&#8221; Morgan elucidates. He meticulously rebuts the assertion that Judge Failla&#8217;s decision against Coinbase has implications for XRP&#8217;s status. Morgan highlights a critical quote from Judge Failla, emphasizing the importance of the context in which crypto-assets are sold and marketed: &#8220;Courts should look to what the offeror invites investors to reasonably understand and expect.&#8221;</p>
<p>This point underlines a significant distinction Morgan draws between the promotional strategies employed by Ripple compared to those scrutinized in other cases. &#8220;Ripple&#8217;s marketing efforts were notably more reserved, aimed at institutional buyers rather than the retail market,&#8221; Morgan observes.</p>
<p>This, according to him, was a pivotal factor in Judge Torres&#8217; decision, which found that the expectation of profits from others&#8217; efforts, a key criterion of the Howey test, did not apply to Ripple&#8217;s programmatic sales of XRP.</p>
Unique Legal Grounds
<p>Morgan further dissects the legal landscape, noting that each case in the crypto space hinges on its particular facts and circumstances. &#8220;The Ripple case, and indeed the legal clarity of XRP, stands on its own merits, distinct from the SEC&#8217;s actions against other entities,&#8221; Morgan asserts. He firmly reiterates that the SEC has not contested Judge Torres&#8217; ruling regarding XRP, which effectively negates the basis for any residual uncertainty about the classification.</p>

<p>Moreover, Morgan quotes directly from the legal proceedings to underscore the specificity of the Ripple case: &#8220;The SEC&#8217;s inability to demonstrate that Ripple promoted XRP to retail purchasers is a testament to the unique circumstances underpinning the case. This is not merely opinion; it&#8217;s a matter of legal fact.&#8221;</p>
<p>Morgan concludes his detailed commentary with a call to the  community and the broader crypto industry to recognize the distinctiveness of each legal case within the sector. &#8220;To conflate the Ripple case with others is to misunderstand the legal landscape in which we operate,&#8221; he states, urging for a more nuanced understanding of regulatory actions against crypto assets.</p>
<p>&#8220;Legal clarity for XRP has been established, irrespective of ongoing or future cases against other tokens or entities. It&#8217;s time to move beyond the FUD and focus on the path ahead,&#8221; Morgan advises.</p>
<p>At press time, XRP traded at $0.59.</p>

<title>Hold On Tight! Skybridge Chief Sees Bitcoin Skyrocketing To $170,000 In 18 Months</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。Anthony Scaramucci对比特币的未来表达了强烈乐观情绪，特别是在预计2024年4月的即将到来的减半事件之后。他预测比特币价格在当前周期结束时至少达到17万美元，并设定了更为宏大的目标为40万美元。他认为比特币交易所交易基金（ETFs）的快速增长是金融机构逐渐采用数字资产的强有力迹象。此外，他强调比特币作为长期价值储存的潜力，并在谈及FTX前首席执行官山姆·班克曼-弗里德的判决时表现出复杂的情绪。 <div>
<p>Anthony Scaramucci, founder and managing partner of SkyBridge Capital, has expressed strong optimism about Bitcoin&#8217;s future, particularly in the wake of the upcoming halving event expected in April 2024.</p>
<p>Scaramucci, a prominent figure in the cryptocurrency space, shared his views in a recent interview with CNBC. He pointed to historical trends following halving events, which reduce the number of new Bitcoins entering circulation, as a reason for his bullish outlook.</p>

<p>Scaramucci predicts <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">BTC price</a> to reach at least $170,000 by the end of the current cycle, which aligns with past price surges after halvings. His long-term vision is even more ambitious, with a target of $400,000 – a price point that would represent half the market capitalization of gold.</p>
<p>He said:</p>
<blockquote>
“Bitcoin is a cyclical product&#8230; typically, it moves 4x within 18 months of the halving. But let’s be a bit conservative on the price, it’s still $170,000 for this cycle.”
</blockquote>
<h2><strong>Bitcoin Adoption On The Rise</strong></h2>
<p>Scaramucci sees the rapid growth of Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as a strong indicator of increasing institutional adoption. He highlights the fact that Bitcoin ETFs surpassed $10 billion in cumulative inflow within just three months, a feat that took Gold ETFs a year to achieve. This suggests a growing appetite for the digital asset among major financial institutions, which could further fuel demand and price appreciation.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p></p>
<h2><strong>Bitcoin: A Long-Term Store Of Value</strong></h2>
<p>He emphasizes Bitcoin&#8217;s potential as a long-term store of value, surpassing its role as a simple hedge against inflation. The leading cryptocurrency&#8217;s finite supply – capped at 21 million coins – combined with its growing adoption, suggests scarcity and potential for significant value growth.</p>













<p>He acknowledges that its volatility is a significant factor to consider, yet he maintains a firm belief that seasoned investors, with a strategic long-term outlook, can successfully navigate through short-term market fluctuations. He perceives Bitcoin&#8217;s enduring trajectory as a promising opportunity for investors to capitalize on, leveraging its potential for sustained growth and value appreciation over time.</p>

<strong>Scaramucci On Sam Bankman-Fried</strong>
<p>The interview also touched upon the recent sentencing of Sam Bankman-Fried, former CEO of the <a href="https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2024/04/04/will-ftxs-customers-be-repaid" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">collapsed FTX exchange.</a> Scaramucci, whose company SkyBridge received a 30% stake acquisition from FTX prior to its bankruptcy, expressed mixed emotions.</p>

<title>FTX Sells Its Solana Holdings At Massive Discount – Here’s How Much</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-sells-its-solana-holdings-at-massive-discount/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-sells-its-solana-holdings-at-massive-discount/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。文章介绍了Defunct最近以巨额折扣的价格出售了其Solana持有的三分之二，并且FTX也以63%的折扣售出了部分Solana。FTX向关键投资者出售了约3000万个SOL代币，筹集了19亿美元的资金。Solana的价格曾经受到FTX的倒闭影响，但最近却在去年底经历了价格飙升，并在去年第四季度取得了巨大成功。Solana在去中心化交易和DeFi领域取得显著进展，市值上涨了97%。当前Solana的价格为179.12美元，过去24小时上涨了1.25%。 <div>
<p>Defunct <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-victims-stories-pile-up-as-sbf-faces-judge/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">crypto exchange FTX</a> recently sold two-thirds of its Solana holdings for a massive discount, Bloomberg reported at the close of the week. </p>
<p>FTX recently <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-set-to-cash-in-884-million-from-sale-anthropic/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">received a court order</a> to sell its massive SOL holdings to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/battle-over-sam-coins-ftx-customers-demand-millions/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">repay its creditors</a>. As one of the largest holders of the cryptocurrency, the news of the court order sparked a wave of concerns from SOL investors, as a total selloff by FTX could tank the price of the cryptocurrency in just a few hours. Interestingly, the bankrupt crypto exchange has now gone ahead to sell a majority of its holdings below market value.</p>

<h2><b>FTX: Details Of The Selloff</b></h2>
<p>As noted by Bloomberg, the bankrupt crypto exchange FTX sold around 30 million tokens to key investors, enabling it to round up $1.9 billion in funds. These SOL tokens were sold to prominent industry figures including Galaxy Trading which bought $620 million worth of SOL and Pantera Capital which bought $250 million worth of SOL. </p>
<p>Considering the number of tokens sold and the amount raised, It is estimated that they were sold at $64 for each SOL. At the time of the transaction, SOL was trading at around $172, meaning they were sold at a 63% discount to the market price and were actually worth $5.16  billion.  </p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/22LtlmRi/" width="2475" /></p>

<p>To avoid a price catastrophe, the SOL tokens which are still under lock, are bound by a four-year vesting schedule with gradual monthly unlocking until January 2028. At the time of writing, the defunct exchange still has 21 million SOL tokens locked up that are worth around $3.75 billion at the current market price.</p>
<h2><b>Current State Of Solana</b></h2>
<p>The eventual collapse of FTX in 2022 led to a cascade of price slumps for Solana. This is because the former CEO of the exchange, Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), was an avid supporter of SOL and had spent so much of the company&#8217;s funds to stock up on the cryptocurrency. As <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-founder-sam-bankman-fried-gets-25-years-in-jail/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoinist reported</a>, SBF has now been handed a 25-year prison sentence for his pivotal role in the collapse of the exchange.</p>

<p>Solana, on the other hand, went through a price surge late last year which saw it eventually stepping out of the shadow left behind by FTX. Aside from its price growth, Solana&#8217;s ecosystem <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana-primed-for-takeoff-expert-analysis-points-to-buying-opportunity/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">has expanded</a> with an <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/meme-coins/top-3-solana-meme-coins/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">increase in meme coin success</a> and is now starting to <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/press-releases/solanas-meme-magic-steps-all-over-ethereum-the-new-kings-of-crypto/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">rival Ethereum</a> as the king of altcoins. </p>
<p>Solana has also <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/forget-q1-slump-solana-explodes-over-300-amid-dex-boom/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">seen robust growth</a> in the Decentralized Exchange (DEX) and Decentralized Finance (DeFi) sectors. Particularly, the blockchain saw its <a href="https://x.com/MessariCrypto/status/1776251285538254854" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">DEX trading volume</a> skyrocket by 332% and its market cap increase by 97% last quarter.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, Solana is trading at $179.12, up by 1.25% in the past 24 hours.</p>

<title>Is Polygon Next In Line? Crypto Analyst Predicts Bullish Breakout To $1</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/polygon-analyst-predicts-breakout-to-1/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/polygon-analyst-predicts-breakout-to-1/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的<br />根据加密货币分析师Ali Martinez的观点，Polygon（MATIC）在过去七天的更广泛调整中仍有可能大幅上涨。尽管过去七天下跌了9.2％，但分析师指出，MATIC在日线图上正在打印出经典的买入信号。TD Sequential技术分析显示了潜在的价格反转的买入信号。此外，MATIC似乎已经形成了价格支撑位，并显示出反弹向上的强烈迹象。潜在的接下来发展是MATIC将持续上涨，并有望突破1美元大关。同时，Polygon正在进行基本变更，例如升级至Polygon 2.0以及将MATIC代币更换为POL代币作为Polygon生态系统的本地燃气和抵押资产。 <div>
<p>According to crypto analyst Ali Martinez, Polygon (MATIC) is poised for major gains amidst a wider correction in the past seven days. <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/polygon-ceo-debunks-layer-3-networks/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Polygon </a>is currently down by 9.2% in the past seven days, but the analyst pointed out that MATIC is printing a textbook buy signal on the daily chart. </p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/ali_charts/status/1776186416336077232" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">recent analysis</a> posted on social media platform X, Martinez noted that the TD Sequential technical analysis presents a buy signal in a potential price reversal.</p>

<h2><b>Crypto Analyst Spots Buy Signal for MATIC</b></h2>
<p>Martinez is known for his <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-mirrors-2021-12/">concise future outlooks</a> regarding popular cryptocurrencies, especially <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bullish-winds-blow-bitcoin-bull-flag-points-to-new-77000-ath-analyst/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bitcoin</a>, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/is-ethereum-in-danger-analyst-warns-of-bearish-future-if-eth-drops-below-this-level/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Ethereum</a>, <a href="https://x.com/ali_charts/status/1776723666656534722" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Solana</a>, and <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-price-600-rally-in-april-crypto-analyst/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Dogecoin</a>. However, he has now made a rare prediction regarding Polygon (MATIC). </p>
<p>At the time of writing, MATIC has mostly traded below the $1 mark since March 29. But according to the analyst, recent price action indicates this is poised to change very soon. According to the 1D chart shared on social media, MATIC seems to have formed major support at $0.8733 and is showing strong signs of a potential bounce to the upside.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The TD Sequential presents a buy signal on the <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24MATIC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">$MATIC</a> daily chart! If <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MATIC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">#MATIC</a> stays strong above $0.87, we could see a rebound to $0.95, or better yet, $1! <a href="https://t.co/YSEoH7JbV4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/YSEoH7JbV4</a></p>
<p>— Ali (@ali_charts) <a href="https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1776186416336077232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">April 5, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>The TD sequential indicator has presented a buy signal in the form of a red nine candlestick, indicating the start of a new upward countdown. If MATIC holds above $0.87, it will confirm the buy signal and likely spark a move to $0.95 to $1 and beyond. The last Polygon time saw a similar signal on the indicator, it went on a moderate increase from $0.95 to $1.08. </p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/NqrOVJgW/" width="2475" /></p>

<h2><b>What’s Next For Polygon?</b></h2>
<p>Polygon is currently undergoing fundamental changes that could determine its price trajectory for the rest of the year. One of these is a planned upgrade to Polygon 2.0 and the switch from the MATIC token to the POL token as the native gas and staking asset of the Polygon ecosystem. </p>

<p>A by-product of this change could be a decrease in trading activity for MATIC, which in turn could lead to a lackluster price action. However, MATIC does appear well positioned for further gains if the technical indicator proves accurate and the overall crypto market returns to a strong bullish momentum. As a result, it could gather enough strength from the bulls to push above $1 again.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the token&#8217;s price action has gone in the way of Martinez&#8217;s analysis since he dropped it. At the time of writing, MATIC is trading at $0.9048, representing a 3.6% increase from $0.8733. On a larger timeframe, MATIC is currently 29% down from its yearly high of $1.2751 which it attained on March 13.</p>

<title>Pantera Capital’s Crypto Fund Records 66% Profit In 2024 Q1: Report</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/pantera-capitals-crypto-fund-records-66-profit-in/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/pantera-capitals-crypto-fund-records-66-profit-in/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。Pantera Capital的Liquid Token Fund在2024年第一季度取得了显著的利润，尽管在过去几个月中卖掉了大量比特币和以太坊相关资产。基金的成功表现主要归功于对数字资产的投资，尤其是Solana。除了Solana外，小市值加密货币和DeFi代币也为该基金带来了强劲表现。同时，基金还减少了比特币和以太坊相关代币的持仓。 <div>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/pantera-cio-ethereum-will-surge-50-transactions/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Pantera Capital</a>, a prominent crypto-focused asset management firm, recorded a significant profit for its Liquid Token Fund in the opening quarter of 2024. This positive performance came despite the fund selling off large portions of its Bitcoin and Ethereum-linked assets over the past few months.</p>
<h2><strong>How Pantera Capital Grew Its Crypto Fund In Q1 2024 </strong></h2>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-06/pantera-capital-crypto-fund-posts-66-gain-aided-by-solana-sol-token" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bloomberg report</a>, Pantera Capital’s  Liquid Token Fund posted a 66% gain in the first quarter of the year. This substantial return was reportedly driven by investment in digital assets, most notably Solana (SOL).</p>
<p>The value of Solana has nearly doubled in the past months, with the cryptocurrency crossing $200 briefly earlier this week. It is worth mentioning that Pantera had launched a $250 million initiative to purchase discounted Solana tokens from the estate of now-bankrupt FTX, as <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/pantera-capital-plans-250m-solana-sol-buy-analyst-predicts-record-rally-toward-1000/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reported by NewsBTC</a> in March.</p>

<p>As of this writing, the Solana token is valued at around $179, reflecting a 2.3% price increase in the past 24 hours. With a market capitalization, the altcoin ranks as the fifth largest cryptocurrency in the sector.</p>
<p><img alt="Pantera" class="aligncenter wp-image-292572 size-large" height="646" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/SOLUSDT_2024-04-07_03-58-05.png?resize=980%2C646" width="980" /></p>

<p>A shareholder letter (seen by Bloomberg) revealed that profits from smaller-cap cryptocurrencies and DeFi tokens, including Ribbon Finance (RBN), Aevo, and Stacks (STX), also contributed to the strong performance of the Liquid Token Fund so far this year. </p>
<p>Based on data from TradingView, the RBN token is up by over 315% year-to-date, while Aevo has soared by nearly 200% in the space of three months. The value of the Stacks token has also witnessed immense growth, jumping by more than 110% in 2024.</p>
<h2><strong>Pantera&#8217;s Crypto Fund Downsizes Its Bitcoin Holdings </strong></h2>
<p>Pantera&#8217;s Liquid Token Fund has also cut back on its positions in Bitcoin and tokens linked to the Ethereum network over the first quarter. According to the shareholder letter, one of the rationales behind the reduced exposure to Ethereum-linked coins is the slim odds of approval of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/spot-ethereum-etf-delay-is-a-good-thing/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">spot Ether exchange-traded fund</a> (ETF) in the United States</p>

<p>Portfolio manager Cosmo Jiang said in an interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>We’d been pretty heavy in Bitcoin until the start of the year, and really like each month we’ve decreased that Bitcoin position meaningfully.</p></blockquote>
<p>The price of Bitcoin climbed by more than 60% in the first quarter of the year, a rise that has been largely attributed to the launch of the spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US. The premier cryptocurrency reached a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-price-nears-all-time-high-5-key-factors/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">new all-time high of $73,798</a> in March, albeit it is currently 5% below this price.</p>

<title>Tornado Cash Legal Saga: Pro-Crypto Groups Support Developer With Amicus Briefs</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/tornado-cash-pro-crypto-groups-support-with-amicus/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/tornado-cash-pro-crypto-groups-support-with-amicus/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章介绍了三个加密货币倡导团体支持Tornado Cash开发者Roman Storm的情况。其中，Blockchain Association反对美国政府指控Tornado Cash运作为未经许可的货币传输业务的罪名；DeFi Education Fund质疑美国政府对于Roman Storm涉嫌违反国际经济紧急权力法案的指控；Coin Center表示，Tornado Cash开发者不应对其服务的使用负责，将其比作为犯罪分子逃避执法机构的汽车。 <div>
<p>In a rapidly developing case, three cryptocurrency advocacy groups have filed amicus briefs in support of Tornado Cash developer Roman Storm, who has been indicted for his role in the creation and operation of the prominent crypto mixer platform. Storm, who has since been apprehended by US authorities, had earlier<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/tornado-cash-co-founder-seeks-to-dismiss-charges/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> filed for a motion</a> to dismiss the charges against him, describing them as “fatally flawed.” </p>
<p>The US citizen, who is one of the three Tornado Cash developers, faces three charges from the US Department of Justice (DOJ) alongside Russian counterpart Roman Semenov who is currently on the loose. Meanwhile, Alexey Pertsev, the last Tornado Cash co-founder, is also <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/tornado-cash-founder-charged-for-allegedly-aiding-1-2-billion-in-laundered-funds/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">undergoing trial</a> in the Netherlands for similar reasons, with a court ruling expected on May 14.
</p>

<h2><strong>Blockchain Association, Others Back Storm’s Dismissal Case</strong></h2>
<p>In solidarity with Tornado Cash developers, the Blockchain Association, Coin Center, and DeFi Education Fund each submitted an individual amicus brief on April 5, supporting Roman’s Storm motion to dismiss charges levied by the DOJ. </p>
<p>All three advocacy groups generally criticized the indictment by the US government, however, with a separate focus on different charges. For instance, the Blockchain Association <a href="https://theblockchainassociation.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Storm-Amicus-BA-As-Filed.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">argued</a> against the charge of conspiracy to operate as an unlicensed money-transmitting business.</p>
<p>The Washington-based pro-crypto group stated that in accordance with the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN),  Tornado Cash did not qualify as a money transmitter as the platform’s operations do not involve independent control over the movement of users&#8217; assets. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the DeFi Education Fund <a href="https://www.defieducationfund.org/_files/ugd/84ba66_063f9d1fd563466cadfa3f5434f918e9.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">slammed</a> the DOJ’s charge of Roman Storm conspiring to violate the International Economic Emergency Powers Act (IEEPA). </p>
<p>The crypto advocacy group questioned the US government’s novel interpretation of the IEEPA in this case,  which would make developers criminally liable for the use of their products or software by sanctioned entities. The DeFi Education Fund believes that such an application of the IEEPA is illegal and could intimidate software developers across all spaces.
</p>

<h2><strong>Tornado Cash Developers Not Liable For Service Usage: Coin Center</strong></h2>
<p>Finally, Coin Center <a href="https://www.coincenter.org/app/uploads/2024/04/Coin-Center-Amicus-Brief-filed.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">countered</a> the DOJ’s charge of a conspiracy to commit money laundering stating that Roman Storm and his co-developers created Tornado Cash as a simple “freely available privacy tool” and are not responding for its uses either by a “criminal or law-abiding citizen.”</p>
<p>The crypto support group drew similarity to the use of cars by criminals in evading law enforcement agencies and these machines are simply still classified as a general means of transportation. In addition, Coin Center also highlighted efforts by the defendants to block access of known persons to the Tornado Cash service following complaints. </p>

<title>Red Flag For eToro? Philippines Investigates Possible Securities Violation</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/red-flag-for-etoro-philippines-investigates/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/red-flag-for-etoro-philippines-investigates/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。菲律宾证券交易委员会（SEC）警告菲律宾投资者使用未注册的在线投资平台的危险。eToro成为最新目标，未在菲律宾注册，也没有根据菲律宾证券法规获取必要的许可证。SEC发布了一份声明，警告公众在这类未注册在线投资平台和其代表中投资前要谨慎。文章还提到了菲律宾政府在规范在线投资领域的趋势，包括对加密货币交易所Binance的警告以及在2024年3月封锁未经许可的加密货币交易所网站的行动。这表明监管机构对在线投资平台崛起可能带来的潜在风险越来越担忧。 <div>
<p>Philippine investors are being warned by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) about the dangers of using unregistered online investment platforms. The latest target is eToro, a popular multinational online crypto trading platform with over 33 million users worldwide.</p>

<h2><strong>eToro Not Registered In The Philippines</strong></h2>
<p>According to the SEC, eToro is not registered as a corporation in the Philippines and critically lacks the necessary licenses required under the country&#8217;s Securities Regulation Code.</p>
<p>This code outlines the legal requirements for companies selling securities, operating as broker-dealers, or running exchanges for trading securities within the country.</p>
<p>The unregistered status of eToro raises red flags for the Philippine regulator. Unregistered platforms are not subject to the same level of regulatory oversight as licensed ones.</p>
<p>This lack of oversight could potentially expose Filipino investors to greater risks, including fraud, manipulation, and difficulty recovering invested funds.</p>
<p>The SEC issued an advisory in March, publicly announced on April 4th, stating that<a href="https://www.etoro.com/crypto/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> eToro</a> is not authorized to sell or offer securities to the public in the Philippines.</p>
<p>The advisory highlights concerns that Filipinos can create user accounts on eToro for the purpose of investing in unregistered investment products.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-292532" height="589" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/a_9d1a18.png?resize=965%2C589" width="965" /></p>

<p>The SEC advisory warns the public &#8220;to exercise caution before investing in these kinds of unregistered online investment platforms and their representatives.&#8221;</p>
<p>The advisory further emphasizes the potential legal consequences for those promoting eToro&#8217;s services in the Philippines without a license. Penalties include hefty fines of up to $88,300 and imprisonment for up to 21 years.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/fQ6PP0T8/" width="2475" /></p>

<h2><strong>eToro&#8217;s Response And Wider Regulatory Trend</strong></h2>
<p>Despite the SEC&#8217;s advisory, eToro&#8217;s website currently lists the Philippines as a supported country.</p>
<p>This crackdown on eToro is part of a wider trend in the Philippines aimed at regulating the online investment landscape.</p>
<p>In November 2023, the SEC issued a similar advisory against cryptocurrency exchange Binance, citing similar concerns about unauthorized securities offerings.</p>
<p>This was followed by the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) blocking access to unlicensed crypto exchange websites in March 2024.</p>

<p>The Philippine government&#8217;s actions highlight a growing concern among regulators worldwide regarding the potential risks associated with the rise of online investment platforms.</p>
<p>While these platforms offer increased accessibility and potentially lower barriers to entry for investors, the lack of proper oversight can pose significant risks.</p>
<p>The Philippines&#8217; case against eToro serves as a cautionary tale for both investors and online investment platforms. Investors are urged to conduct thorough research and ensure platforms they use are properly licensed and regulated within their jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Online investment platforms, on the other hand, need to be mindful of international regulations and ensure they comply with the legal requirements of the countries where they operate.</p>

<title>Shiba Inu Large Transactions Spike Over 1,000% – Are Whales Ready To Drive The Price To $0.00008?</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-large-transactions-spike-over-1000/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-large-transactions-spike-over-1000/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />Shiba Inu（SHIB）在过去一周中价格波动较大，其中一些大型投资者（鲸鱼）在价格下跌时购入了大量SHIB。新的鲸鱼账户在一天内从加密货币交易所Coinbase和Binance购入了价值约490万美元的1840亿SHIB。尽管SHIB价格走势偏向熊市，但新钱包持有者和其他多头鲸鱼的买入表明他们认为价格将恢复并上涨。据一位加密分析师Captain Faibik称，Shiba Inu价格图表上出现了新的技术模式，可能使其在4月第二到第三周间上涨至0.00058至0.00062美元。 <div>
<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB) has seen its price going through <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-brink-of-crashing/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">a decline</a> this week amidst <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-indicator-signaled-downturn-advance/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">wider corrections from most</a> cryptocurrencies. The past seven days <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-dips-below-0-00003-again-can-bulls-reverse-the-bullish-momentum/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">have been rough for SHIB hodlers</a>, as the meme coin fell to as low as 0.00002584 earlier in the week, representing a price decline of over 15% from $0.00003069. However, it would seem the price decline has created an opportunity for some large investors, known as whales, to buy SHIB at a discount. </p>

<p>According to on-chain data, some new SHIB whale accounts amassed 184 billion SHIB, worth approximately $4.9 million in the middle of the week from crypto exchanges Coinbase and Binance.</p>
<h2><b>New Whales Loading Up SHIB During The Dip</b></h2>
<p>Shiba Inu has constantly seen an increase in the number of whale wallets holding SHIB throughout its history. The recent accumulation by three new wallets was noted on social media by on-chain transaction tracker &#8220;The Data Nerd&#8221; during the week. The shared screenshots show two of the new wallets each acquired $2 million worth of SHIB tokens from Coinbase. The last wallet accumulated $1 million worth of SHIB from Binance, all within the space of 24 hours. </p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Wow <img alt="😳" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f633.png" style="height: 1em;" />
That&#8217;s amazing
Anyway do you know where you can see instant prepared cards without KYC in 200+ countries and 20+ providers. <a href="https://twitter.com/PayPaw_Cards?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">@PayPaw_Cards</a> is at your service.</p>

<p></p>
<p>An inspection of these wallets shows they are still holding these tokens. Interestingly, a 2% price surge for SHIB in the past 24 hours has seen these wallets already making profits. </p>
<h2><b>Can Whales Push Shiba Inu To $0.00008?</b></h2>
<p>Whales <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-whales-shib/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">often drive price action</a> and sentiment in the crypto market. There&#8217;s no denying that Shiba Inu is largely undergoing a bearish price action after <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-price-soars-10-in-reaction-to-explosive-2367-shib-burn-surge/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">weeks of bullish action</a> in February and March. Current <a href="https://app.intotheblock.com/coin/SHIB/deep-dive?group=financials&amp;chart=bullsAndBears" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">data from IntoTheBlock</a> shows SHIB whales are now <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/shiba-inu-fires-up-with-4000-burn-price-rebound-coming/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">tipped to the bearish side</a> of things with 123 bear whales as opposed to 117 bull whales in a seven-day average. </p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/pqHQXhSj/" width="2475" /></p>

<p>This tug of momentum has seen SHIB trading between the $0.00002392 support and 0.00003308 resistance during this timeframe. Bounced two times on support and rejected two times at resistance, as <a href="https://x.com/army_shiba/status/1775082632205771043" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">noted by crypto</a> analyst SHIB Knight.</p>

<p>However, the recent buy by the new wallets and other bull whales suggests some of them think the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-takes-social-activity-spikes/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">current dip is temporary</a> and that the price will recover and head back up.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.00002736 and is down by 23% from $0.00003592, its highest point so far in this bull run. <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-to-rally-100-0-000062/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">According to</a> crypto analyst Captain Faibik, a new technical pattern has emerged on the Shiba Inu price chart that could send it surging and reaching between $0.00058 to $0.00062 in the second to third week of April. </p>
<p>A full reverse into bullish momentum could see Shiba Inu pushing past this price level into $0.00008 and beyond, especially as bullish activity returns among a majority of the whales. </p>

<title>Optimism Continues Downward Spiral – Brace For Impact</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/optimism-continues-downward-spiral-brace-for-impact/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/optimism-continues-downward-spiral-brace-for-impact/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。OP代币价格突破了上升趋势后创下了新的历史高位，但随后持续下跌。 技术指标显示价格处于持续下降趋势，目前低于100天移动平均线和趋势线。MACD和买卖力量指标都显示了强劲的向下动能。支撑水平已被突破，如果价格继续下跌，则可能突破之前的支撑水平。然而，如果价格无法跌破$2.61的支撑水平，可能会出现新的上升趋势。 <div>
<p>OP, the native token of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/optimism-announces-third-round-of-token-airdrop/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Optimism</a>, broke out of an uptrend after setting a new all-time high of $4.87. The price has continued to drop since then, and currently points to a continuous downward drop. </p>
<p>Analysis of the crypto asset&#8217;s trend indicates that the price is on a downtrend which is currently trading below the 100-day Moving Average (MA) and the trend line. However, at the time of writing, Optimism was trading at around $2.9 and was up by about 1.22%.</p>
<p>As a result of this change in trend, two major resistance levels were formed at $4.87 and $4.04, and a support level of $2.95. But currently, the price has broken past this support level.</p>
<h2>Technical Indicators Point Toward A Continuous Downtrend For Optimism</h2>
<p>When analyzing <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/top-3-crypto-tokens-predicted-to-explode-in-q4-2023-ethereum-optimism-bitcoin-minetrix/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">OP&#8217;s price</a> movement using the daily candlestick timeframe, we can see that after a drop from its all-time high, the token was unable to bounce back. This has led to the price trading below both the trendline and the 100-day moving average as can be seen in the below image. </p>
<p><img alt="Optimism" class="size-medium wp-image-292454 aligncenter" height="420" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/WhatsApp-Image-2024-04-06-at-6.25.35-AM-2.jpeg?w=357&#038;resize=357%2C420" width="357" /></p>
<p>Based on this recent change in trend and shift in momentum, Optimism could be poised for a continuous downward move, especially in the context of the fact that the general <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/render-token-tms-network-and-optimism-stand-tall-during-market-downturn/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">crypto market is experiencing a drop</a>.</p>
<p>A further look at the price using the MACD indicator in the daily timeframe shows that the MACD line and the signal line have crossed, trending below the zero line. Meanwhile, the MACD histogram is also trending below the zero line. This MACD formation indicates a strong downward momentum.</p>
<p><img alt="Optimism" class="size-medium wp-image-292456 aligncenter" height="372" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/WhatsApp-Image-2024-04-06-at-6.25.35-AM.jpeg?w=640&#038;resize=640%2C372" width="640" /></p>
<p>A final look at the chart with the Bull power vs. Bear power indicator from the daily timeframe reveals from the histogram that sellers have completely taken over the market. Consequently, buyers have gradually lost momentum to push the price upward.</p>
<h2>How Low Can OP Go?</h2>
<p>If the price of Optimism continues to rally in the downward direction, there could be a price break out below its previous support level of $2.61. Also, it could be possible that the price could move even further toward achieving a new support level.</p>
<p>However, with the history of the exponential growth associated with <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/optimism-op-and-immutable-x-imx-show-strength-amidst-market-downturn-rebel-satoshi-rblz-continues-to-rally/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">OP</a>, If the price fails to break or move below its previous support level of $2.61, a new upward trend could begin therefore propelling the price up to retest its previous resistance levels.</p>

<title>Dogecoin, PEPE, And WIF Lead The Charge As Meme Coin Demand Reach 2021 Levels</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-pepe-wif-meme-coin/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-pepe-wif-meme-coin/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章介绍了最近关于狗狗币、PEPE和WIF等模因币需求的增长。模因币市场价值达到560亿美元，今年几乎翻了三倍，领跑者包括狗狗币、PEPE和SHIB。由于低手续费生态系统的盛行，Solana已经多次超越以太坊交易量。尽管认为模因币缺乏实际用途，但它们仍然备受关注且能吸引新的加密货币用户。 <div>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/3-meme-coins-1000-return/">Meme coins</a> such as Dogecoin, PEPE, and WIF have continued to enjoy greater acceptance, which is evident in recent data showing that the demand for them has clocked a new high. This also undoubtedly strengthens predictions that this category of crypto tokens will be one of the leading narratives in this <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bull-market-glassnode/">market cycle</a>.</p>
<h2>Dogecoin, PEPE, And WIF Lead Demand For Meme Coins</h2>
<p>Market intelligence platform <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/500-million-worth-of-eth-leave-exchanges-last-week/">IntoTheBlock</a> recently <a href="https://intotheblock-5494544.hs-sites.com/q1-2024-on-chain?ecid=ACsprvv5ayYczXaQBlG6zaGGR-Q4Y5AkTkpr9cyUfuXfZbe-0C5S01HVDUbcyXLTNcn9NlpciBKV&amp;utm_campaign=Newsletter&amp;utm_source=hs_email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=301330579&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-837G7htC52qN5S5wK309Xf9ZVD_MoX4jJP11ibFBiTuONsa8JG1d2ezGZHnsie98zhsgPE6Fg541aNYFOzm4Bhxl1r_3yZ7tlzgfkhhfBzINRmm-s" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">revealed</a> that the demand for meme coins hit its highest in the first quarter of this year since 2021. Furthermore, the increased demand has led to the launch of newer meme coins, pushing the market cap of this crypto category to its highest in two years. </p>

<p>Their market currently stands at over $56 billion, meaning their aggregate value has nearly tripled this year. As expected, OG meme coins like <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-whale-dumps-substantial-holdings-on-the-market-heres-how-much/">Dogecoin (DOGE)</a>, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/dogecoin-shiba-inu-pepe-explode/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Pepe (PEPE)</a>, and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-dogecoin-shib-excitement/">Shiba Inu (SHIB)</a> have led the way. Dogecoin has seen its price double in 2024, while PEPE and SHIB have recorded a 5x and 2.5x gain, respectively.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, newcomer <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogwifhat-wif-meme-coin-las-vegas-sphere/">Dogwifhat (WIF)</a> has also earned a spot at the table, with a 20x yearly return and rising to become the third-largest meme coin by market cap. WIF’s growth has been mainly credited to its “rampant community,” which includes <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/over-2-6m-stolen-in-phishing-scam-involving-top-crypto-trader/">well-known crypto influencer Ansem</a>. </p>
<p><img alt="Dogecoin, WIF, PEPE" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-292420 aligncenter" height="294" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-06-at-09.10.56.png?w=640&#038;resize=640%2C294" width="640" /></p>
<p>IntoTheBlock further revealed that meme coins have thrived in lower-fee ecosystems, with Solana recording multiple days since the beginning of the year when it surpassed Ethereum in trading volume. Thanks to this meme coin frenzy, Solana has also seen increased network activity, with Bitcoinist <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-existential-moment-co-founder-speaks-out/">reporting</a> that Solana is currently facing unprecedented levels of congestion. </p>
<h2>Meme Coins Are Here To Stay</h2>
<p>IntoTheBlock noted that meme coins were able to achieve this record despite interest rates remaining high and no “stimmy checks” being sent out. The platform further speculated on what could be the reason for the increased demand for crypto tokens, which have been <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-ceo-dogecoin-details/">largely criticized</a> for lacking any real-life utility. </p>

<p>Irrespective of the reason, it has become clear that meme coins are here to stay, seeing as they have become one of the main subjects in the crypto space over the last few months. <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-scalability-leap-vitalik-buterin-solution/">Ethereum’s founder, Vitalik Buterin</a>, also recently published an article in which he admitted this fact and declared that it was best to determine how these crypto tokens could gain utility. </p>
<p>Despite their supposed lack of utility, the buzz around meme coins could be good for the crypto space in terms of their ability to onboard a new wave of crypto users. <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-when-dogecoin-does-this/#:~:text=Crypto%20expert%20Scott%20Melker%2C">Crypto expert Scott Melker</a> recently <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-when-dogecoin-does-this/#:~:text=Dogecoin&#039;s%20Role%20In%20Attracting%20Mainstream%20Demand%20For%20Crypto&amp;text=His%20belief%20is%20based%20on,(non%2Dfungible%20tokens).&amp;text=He%20alluded%20to%20how%20these,sign%20up%20and%20buy%20DOGE.">highlighted</a> how the hype around DOGE ushered in mainstream demand for crypto tokens in the 2021 bull run, and the same thing could happen in this market cycle. </p>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />Uniswap，去中心化交易所的先驱，已经超过2万亿美元的历史交易量。这一里程碑标志着平台自2018年11月推出以来的快速增长轨迹。Uniswap具有多链兼容性，支持以太坊、Polygon和Avalanche等各种区块链上的交易，促进了其广泛采用。平台的周交易量约为220亿美元，是最接近竞争对手PancakeSwap的两倍。Uniswap Labs积极参与社区，并在平台交易量突破阈值时提供200美元的奖励，展示了其与用户群体互动的承诺。未来，Uniswap需要应对用户体验、安全性和潜在监管干预等挑战，以保持其领先地位的关键将取决于它如何应对这些挑战。 <div>
<p>Uniswap, the pioneering decentralized exchange (DEX), has cemented its position as the leader in the crypto trading sphere by surpassing a staggering $2 trillion in all-time trading volume. This achievement, reached on April 5th, signifies a major milestone for the platform, highlighting its remarkable growth trajectory since its launch in November 2018.</p>

<p>Data compiled by Zach Wong, Uniswap&#8217;s strategy and operations lead, reveals the DEX&#8217;s impressive trading volume figures. The $2 trillion mark was achieved on April 5th, with a significant contribution coming from transactions across various blockchains supported by Uniswap, including Ethereum, Polygon, and Avalanche. This multi-chain compatibility is believed to be a key driver of Uniswap&#8217;s widespread adoption.</p>

<p></p>
<h2>Uniswap: 42 Months To Hit 1st Trillion</h2>
<p>Uniswap&#8217;s journey to this milestone has been remarkable. It took 42 months to reach the first trillion in trading volume in May 2022. However, the subsequent growth has been exponential, showcasing accelerating user activity and solidifying Uniswap&#8217;s dominance in the DEX market.</p>
<p>Data from a <a href="https://dune.com/hagaetc/dex-metrics" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Dune Analytics</a> dashboard maintained by Uniswap co-founder Fredrik Haga indicates Uniswap&#8217;s weekly trading volume at nearly $22 billion, more than double its closest competitor, PancakeSwap.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-292437" height="402" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/a_dce3af.png?resize=1024%2C402" width="1024" /></p>

<p>This achievement wasn&#8217;t met with silence. Anticipating the milestone, Uniswap Labs actively engaged the community. They announced the impending $2 trillion mark on April 4th and even incentivized participation by offering a $200 USD Coin (USDC) reward to the first person who captured a video clip showcasing the moment Uniswap&#8217;s trading volume crossed the threshold.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/ywl8HrqY/" width="2475" /></p>

<h2>Opportunities And Challenges Ahead</h2>
<p>The success of <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Uniswap</a> can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, its focus on innovation has been instrumental. The platform leverages smart contracts to facilitate automated digital asset exchanges on the Ethereum blockchain, offering a permissionless and transparent trading experience.</p>
<p>Secondly, Uniswap&#8217;s multi-chain compatibility expands its reach, catering to users across various blockchain ecosystems. Finally, fostering a strong community seems to be another key ingredient. The $2 trillion milestone celebration reward exemplifies Uniswap&#8217;s commitment to engaging its user base.</p>

<p>However, the future of DEXs like Uniswap holds both opportunities and challenges. While DEXs offer advantages like decentralization and censorship resistance, they can also face hurdles related to user experience, security, and potential regulatory interventions. How Uniswap navigates these challenges and adapts its platform will be crucial in maintaining its leading position.</p>

<title>Crypto Investigator Accuses US Law Enforcement Of ‘Harassment’</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-sleuth-accuses-authorities-of-harassment/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-sleuth-accuses-authorities-of-harassment/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。文章揭示了区块链侦探ZachXBT在美国的某个执法机构询求帮助的经历，称其被IRS刑事调查单位的特工“边缘骚扰”。ZachXBT拒绝帮助电子犯罪受害者，但对被盯上的复杂（简）项目的持有者提出拒绝，这引起了关注。文章指出，IRS特工曾经在真实地址上找到过他，使用个人电子邮件联络，还寄信，而ZachXBT则拒绝在其隐私遭到侵犯时提供帮助。 <div>
<p>Scams and hacks have been some of the most significant issues affecting the crypto industry over the past few years. As a result, the space has seen the birth of several blockchain investigators striving to ensure the digital asset space is safe for everyone to go about their business with ease and confidence.</p>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/coinspot-nightmare-2-million-wallet-loss/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">ZachXBT</a>, one of these popular on-chain sleuths on the X platform, has come forward with an interesting revelation about his recent encounters with a certain law enforcement agency in the United States. The investigator disclosed that he has been “borderline harassed” by this agency in the last few months.</p>
<h2>Authorities Seek Help From On-Chain Sleuth </h2>
<p>On Friday, April 5, ZachXBT revealed &#8211;  via a <a href="https://x.com/zachxbt/status/1776282328572072137" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post on X</a> &#8211; that he has been repeatedly harassed by agents of the Criminal Investigation (CI) unit of the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The on-chain detective accused these individuals of a “blatant disregard for professionalism” in the process of asking for his assistance on blockchain investigations on multiple occasions.</p>

<p>ZachXBT said in his post:</p>
<blockquote><p>They have shown up irl (in real life) to old addresses, contacted personal emails using private data, and have sent mail when I have public contact methods readily available.</p></blockquote>
<p>In one of the shared images, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/hackers-stole-60-million-from-alphapo/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">ZachXBT showed</a> an email from an IRS-CI special agent asking for the crypto investigator’s assistance on new digital asset cases. The IRS-CI special agent went on to praise the blockchain sleuth for doing some “really impressive work” to ensure the safety of the crypto space.</p>
<p><img alt="ZachXBT" class="aligncenter wp-image-292404 size-large" height="660" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GKafXNdWIAAA61s.jpeg?resize=710%2C660" width="710" /></p>

<p>Furthermore, ZachXBT reiterated his commitment to helping victims of scams by providing the necessary documentation to law enforcement agencies. However, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/zachxbt-slapped-with-defamation-lawsuit/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">on-chain investigator</a> mentioned his unwillingness to do so once his boundaries and privacy were breached.</p>
<h2>ZachXBT Refuses To Help In Crypto-Related Crimes</h2>
<p>It appears that a “blatant disregard for any professionalism” is not the only reason ZachXBT would decline to offer his expertise in blockchain crime cases. Recently, the crypto detective refused to help holders of Complex (SIMPLE), a meme coin project that was shut down a few days after its launch on the Base network.</p>
<p>ZachXBT explained in a <a href="https://x.com/zachxbt/status/1775948548804141508" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post on X</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I simply dislike spending long periods helping people who willingly choose to gamble on vaporware meme coins vs. actual victims.</p></blockquote>

<p>According to a <a href="https://x.com/ComplexBase/status/1775932201185480986" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">statement</a> on April 4, the meme coin’s developers shut down the Complex project due to recent instances of harassment, citing its impact on the mental well-being of their members. As of press time, the SIMPLE coin has lost almost all of its value, with a market cap of less than $80,000.</p>

<title>US Jury Finds Do Kwon, Terraform Labs Liable For Fraud In SEC Trial</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/us-jury-deems-do-kwon-terraform-liable-for-fraud/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/us-jury-deems-do-kwon-terraform-liable-for-fraud/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。根据彭博社报道，美国陪审团认定 Terraform Labs 和其联合创始人 Do Kwon 对 2022 年 Terra 生态系统崩溃承担民事欺诈责任。 美国证券交易委员会（SEC）赢得对 Terraform Labs 和 Do Kwon 的责任诉讼，指控二者策划了数十亿美元的加密货币诈骗。此外，黑山最高法院推翻了对 Do Kwon 引渡至韩国的命令。这展示了在 Terra 项目崩溃事件中正在进行的复杂法律斗争。 <div>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-05/do-kwon-and-terraform-labs-found-liable-for-fraud-in-sec-trial" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Friday report</a> by Bloomberg, a  United States jury found Terraform Labs and its co-founder Do Kwon liable for civil fraud over the crash of the Terra ecosystem in 2022. This development comes as Do Kwon continues to battle criminal cases in the US and South Korea over the sudden collapse of the popular crypto project, which resulted in a $40 billion loss of investor assets.
</p>

<h2>SEC Wins Liability Suit Against Terraform Labs</h2>
<p>In February 2023, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sec-sue-terraform-labs/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">filed a lawsuit</a> against Terraform Labs and Do Kwon for orchestrating a multi-billion dollar crypto scam involving the sale of multiple digital assets, especially LUNA and the algorithmic stablecoin Terra USD (UST).</p>
<p>Based on Bloomberg&#8217;s latest report, a seven-man jury in New York has now deemed the defendants liable for fraud in this government case, thus providing the SEC with a boost in its ongoing crackdown on the digital asset industry.</p>
<p>While the trial lasted for two weeks, the jury deliberations on Friday revealed that Do Kwon and Terraform Lab purported that Chai, a prominent South Korean payment processing platform, was a user of the Terra blockchain network. Furthermore, the jury also concluded that the defendants deceived investors on the stability of the UST stablecoin, whose de-peg from the US Dollar was a critical event in the Terra ecosystem collapse. </p>
<p>Commenting on this development, the SEC’s enforcement director, Gurbir Grewal, reiterated the agency’s desire for a cryptocurrency legal, and regulatory framework. </p>
<p>Grewal said:</p>
<blockquote><p>As the hard work of our team shows, we will continue to use the tools at our disposal to protect the investing public, but it is high time for the crypto markets to come into compliance.</p></blockquote>
<p>Following the conclusions of the New York Jury, the SEC has now won claims of liability against Kwon and Terraform. Thereafter, the securities watchdog is now seeking a court order on civil penalties against the defendants and the recovery of ill-gotten gains and payment of prejudgment interests.
</p>

<h2>Montenegrin Apex Court Reverses Do Kwon’s Extradition Order</h2>
<p>In other news, the Supreme Court of Montenegro has overturned the extradition order of Do Kwon to South Korea by a lower court. This development came <a href="http://Montenegro’s Apex Court Postpones Do Kwon’s Extradition Indefinitely" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">following a petition</a> by the Supreme State Prosecutor’s Office of the Balkan nation which highlighted a breach of authority and procedural violations in the rejection of an appeal from Kwon’s legal team by an appellate court.</p>
<p>Following deliberations, the Montenegrin Apex Court has now ruled in favor of the Prosecutor’s Office and ordered a reevaluation of the extradition requests of the US and South Korea for the popular crypto figure. </p>
<p>Do Kwon was arrested in March 2023 by local Montenegrin authorities for traveling with falsified documents. Since then, the “highly wanted” Terraform co-founder has been the subject of an extradition contest between both countries who are pressing criminal charges over the crash of the Terra blockchain project.</p>

<title>BlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF Broadens Reach, Securing 5 New Wall Street Banking Giants As APs</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-broadens-reach/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-broadens-reach/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。最近，比特币在传统金融机构和资产管理者中的吸引力不断增加，特别是BlackRock、Grayscale和Fidelity等行业领导者提供的比特币ETF产品取得了显著成功。BlackRock新增了五个授权参与方，包括Citadel、花旗集团、UBS和ABN AMRO，以支持iShares比特币信托基金（IBIT）ETF。此举显示了华尔街对比特币相关金融产品的兴趣和接受程度，同时墨索里银行、花旗集团、瑞士银行和Citadel等金融巨头纷纷加入ETF市场。SEC最近批准的十只现货ETFs持续吸引投资者兴趣，而GBTC则出现巨额净流出。IBIT ETF表现出色，吸引了约1.44亿美元的净流入。BTC的价格固定在67,700美元，尽管比特币ETF市场取得了成功，但在过去七天内价格下跌了2%。 <div>
<p>In recent times, the increasing appeal of Bitcoin (BTC) among asset managers and traditional finance (TradFi) institutions has gained significant attention, particularly with the notable success of Bitcoin ETF products offered by industry leaders like BlackRock, Grayscale, and Fidelity. </p>
<p>This success has prompted more Wall Street banking institutions to eagerly enter the newly approved ETF market as authorized participants (AP).</p>
<h2>Major Institutions Join BlackRock</h2>
<p>As per recently disclosed <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1980994/000143774924011116/bit20240314_posam.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">notes</a>, BlackRock has expanded the list of authorized participants for its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) ETF. </p>
<p>BlackRock&#8217;s addition of five new participants, including <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/goldman-sachs-maintains-crypto-skepticism/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Goldman Sachs</a>, Citadel, Citigroup, UBS, and clearing house ABN AMRO, brings the total number of authorized participants to nine. This move comes as the fund attracts substantial investments from individuals and institutions. </p>

<p>It is worth noting that Jane Street Capital, JPMorgan, Macquarie, and Virtu Americas were already on the authorized participant list.</p>
<p>According to BlackRock&#8217;s filing, the authorized participants will exclusively transact in cash to create and redeem <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etf-issuer-vaneck-dives-stablecoin-market/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">ETF shares</a>. They will not directly or indirectly handle Bitcoin as part of the creation or redemption process. </p>
<p>Authorized Participants play a critical role in the ETF ecosystem. They have agreements with ETF issuers that give them the right to create and redeem ETF shares in response to market demand. These participants may act on their behalf or that of other <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/morgan-stanley-bitcoin-etfs-2-weeks-insider/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">market participants </a>and are not compensated by ETF issuers. </p>
<p>By dynamically adjusting the number of ETF shares outstanding, authorized participants aim to increase efficiency and reduce costs for ETF investors.</p>
<h2>Wall Street Giants Embrace Bitcoin ETF Market</h2>
<p>Adding high-profile Wall Street institutions such as Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, UBS, and Citadel to the Authorized Participants underscores the growing interest and acceptance of Bitcoin-related financial products. </p>
<p>Bloomberg ETF expert Eric Balchunas <a href="https://x.com/EricBalchunas/status/1776229982559223971" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">suggests </a>that these banking giants either have a newfound interest in the sector or are now comfortable publicly associating with it. </p>
<p>According to Balchunas, their participation was not previously explicitly mentioned in ETF filings. However, these ETFs&#8217; remarkable growth and success have likely influenced their decision to participate openly.</p>
<p>Regarding market flows, the ten Spot ETFs recently approved by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have <a href="https://x.com/WuBlockchain/status/1776259143961288816" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">shown </a>steady investor interest. On April 4, these ETFs recorded a notable net inflow of $213 million, marking the third consecutive day of positive flows.</p>
<img alt="BlackRock" class="size-large wp-image-292320" height="396" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GKaKFShbMAAFKqX.jpeg?w=980&#038;resize=980%2C396" width="980" />
<p>However, Grayscale&#8217;s GBTC experienced a substantial net outflow of $79.3 million within a single day. The historical net <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-beats-okx-and-kraken-holdings/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">outflow </a>for GBTC has now reached $15.31 billion. </p>
<p>On the other hand, BlackRock&#8217;s IBIT ETF emerged as the top performer, witnessing a significant net inflow of approximately $144 million on the same day. This brings IBIT&#8217;s total historical net inflow to $14.4 billion.</p>

<p>BTC trades at $67,700, experiencing sideways price action over the past 24 hours and a 2% price decline over the past seven days despite the Bitcoin ETF market’s success. </p>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。<br />文章讨论了知名交易员彼得·布兰特对以太坊(ETH)的批评，将其称为“垃圾币”并指出其存储价值和层2解决方案等方面的问题。布兰特的评论引发了社区内对ETH前景的不同观点，包括JP摩根全球市场策略团队对以太坊不被归类为证券的观点。社区对布兰特的批评产生了不同的反应，有人支持他的观点，也有人反对，认为以太坊具有比比特币更广泛的功能。<br /> <div>
<p>Recently, renowned trader Peter Brandt <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterLBrandt/status/1775973571896176785?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">voiced</a> criticism directed squarely at Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest crypto by market capitalization, denouncing it as a &#8220;junk coin&#8221; in a blunt assessment.</p>
<h2>Ethereum Faces Criticism</h2>
<p>Celebrated for his insights into financial markets, Peter Brandt spared no punches as he castigated Ethereum, arguing that it lacks the essential characteristics required for long-term success.</p>

<p>His remarks underscored ETH&#8217;s perceived weaknesses as a store of value and its struggles with layer-2 solutions and high gas fees, factors he believes contribute to its inferiority compared to Bitcoin.</p>
<p>To support his assertions, Brandt posted an Ethereum/Bitcoin price chart and his criticism of ETH, showing the asset&#8217;s consistent decline relative to Bitcoin in the past year. </p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I get tired of saying it, but <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ETH&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">$ETH</a> is a junk coin despite mindless devotion of Etheridiots.

<p>While Brandt was dishing out his critique on ETH, other voices presented contrasting perspectives on Ethereum&#8217;s prospects.</p>
<p>In a notable defense of the asset, JP Morgan&#8217;s Global Markets Strategy team recently unveiled reasons Ethereum may not be classified as a security, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/jp-morgan-reason-ethereum-not-security/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">highlighting shifts in the network&#8217;s staking ecosystem</a> towards greater decentralization.</p>
<p>This transition, evidenced by the decline in Lido&#8217;s share of staked ETH, is seen as a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/spot-ethereum-etf-delay-is-a-good-thing/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">positive development</a> that could assuage regulatory concerns and &#8220;bolster&#8221; Ethereum&#8217;s case against a security designation.</p>
<p>JP Morgan&#8217;s analysis draws attention to the pivotal &#8220;Hinman documents,&#8221; which have shaped the SEC&#8217;s approach to digital tokens.</p>
<p>These documents emphasize the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-roadmap-buterin-reveals-plans-the-purge/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">importance of network decentralization</a> in determining whether tokens qualify as securities, suggesting that tokens on sufficiently decentralized networks may be exempt.</p>

<h2>Community Reaction To Brandt&#8217;s Critique</h2>
<p>Interestingly, Brandt&#8217;s criticism of ETH sparked a diverse range of reactions within the community. While some stood behind Brandt&#8217;s assessment, others vehemently opposed it and came to Ethereum&#8217;s defense. Among those supporting Brandt&#8217;s critique was Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream.</p>
<p>Back weighed in, highlighting Ethereum&#8217;s vulnerability to significant hacks, scams, and rug-pulls, which have amounted to over $1 billion per quarter. He underscored the growing complexity of Ethereum&#8217;s scripting, emphasizing how <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-surging-ahead-of-ethereum-in-this-metric/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">increased complexity</a> often leads to security vulnerabilities.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">don&#8217;t forget the &gt; $1bi per quarterl hacks, &#8220;hacks&#8221; and rug-pulls on it&#8217;s seemingly unsecurable script, which is just getting worse over time, because complexity kills; and the eths in charge just continue adding complexity&#8230;</p>
<p>— Adam Back (@adam3us) <a href="https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/1776213571837235339?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">April 5, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, another X user named Collin offered a contrasting perspective. Collin <a href="https://x.com/ColinTCrypto/status/1776054450366427540?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">pointed out</a> Brandt&#8217;s criticism seemed &#8220;biased&#8221; and failed to &#8220;acknowledge ETH&#8217;s <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-co-founder-delivers-key-remarks-on-layer-3/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">unique capabilities</a> beyond Bitcoin.&#8221;</p>

<p>He argued that Ethereum&#8217;s programmability sets it apart, allowing for features and functionalities that Bitcoin cannot replicate. Collin added:</p>
<blockquote><p>And yes, ETH’s fees are high. But Ethereum is doing *more* than bitcoin is doing per block. Also, BTC’s fees have been crazy high in the past ($50+ per transaction), and they *will* go up again (by intentional design) in the future. So, if high fees are your complaint, you may want to take a good hard look at Bitcoin’s future security roadmap. High fees are baked in. Big time. You should continue your research on this, Peter.</p></blockquote>

<title>Cardano War Chest Growing: Why Is ADA Dropping?</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-war-chest-growing-why-is-ada-dropping/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-war-chest-growing-why-is-ada-dropping/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章指出，Cardano的资金库正在迅速增长，目前持有超过1.48亿ADA价值超过8.43亿美元。这将有助于支持ADA价格。Cardano资金库的增长对于发展是利好的，特别是在Basho阶段，旨在改善性能。虽然ADA价格受到卖方的压力，但分析师指出，技术图表显示积极信号。密切关注可能的合作伙伴关系，包括美国各州对Cardano开发者开发透明区块链投票平台的讨论。 <div>
<p>On-chain data on April 5 <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://cexplorer.io/pot" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">shows</a> that the Cardano Treasury is rapidly growing even as ADA prices struggle to shake off determined sellers. Currently, the treasury holds over 1.48 billion ADA worth over $843 million at spot rates. </p>
<p>If adoption projections are anything to go by, the figure could exponentially increase in the coming months, possibly propping up ADA prices.  </p>
<h2>Cardano Treasury Rising: Bullish For Development</h2>
<p>The Cardano Treasury exists by <a href="https://docs.cardano.org/explore-cardano/monetary-policy/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">design</a>. It serves as a war chest to fund ongoing development. </p>
<img alt="Cardano treasury growing | Source: Cexplorer" class="size-full wp-image-292279" height="433" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot629.png?resize=1024%2C433" width="1024" />
<p>A fixed amount of ADA is set aside per epoch—that is when a block of transactions is confirmed—and sent to the treasury. Every epoch is completed roughly after five days.</p>
<p>Besides ADA accumulation from reserves, the treasury reserves a portion of funds from transaction fees. The more Cardano finds adoption and hosts decentralized applications (dapps) like decentralized exchanges (DEXes), the more the treasury goes.</p>

<p>With ADA from every epoch and transaction fees, Cardano gets sufficient funds to continue development. This arrangement is critical considering that Input-Output Global (IOG) is actively pushing new updates to make the network more performant and reliable.</p>
<p>Currently, in the Basho stage, the objective is to improve performance, allowing the network to host intensive dapps and compete with Ethereum and Solana. Already, Cardano is finding favor, especially from governments. </p>
<p>Apart from liaising with the government of Ethiopia to enhance education by leveraging the blockchain, agencies in the United States and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-is-europes-2nd-most-beloved-crypto/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Europe</a> are also looking at Cardano.</p>
<h2>Will Rumored Partnership Drive ADA Higher?</h2>
<p>Rumors suggest that various states in the United States have approached Cardano developers about developing a transparent blockchain voting platform. Though discussions are said to be underway, key details remain out of public reach. </p>
<p>Even so, there are blockchains of choice other than Cardano. Options like Solana or Ethereum can be solid alternatives. One of the world&#8217;s largest asset managers, BlackRock, issued a tokenized fund on Ethereum, seeding it with $100 million. </p>
<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/x/2BmMJsOL/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Cardano price trending downward on the daily chart | Source: ADAUSDT on Binance, TradingView" class="size-full" height="904" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/2BmMJsOL/" width="1787" /></a>
<p>Whether the community will accept partnership deals as bullish remains to be seen. Presently, ADA is under pressure, dropping 30% from March highs. Despite attempts for higher highs on April 4, sellers flew back today, wiping out gains.</p>

<p>Any breakout below $0.55 might accelerate the dump towards $0.45, wiping out Q1 2024 gains.</p>
<img alt="ADA prices bullish | Analyst on X" class="size-full wp-image-292280" height="576" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GKFIorvW8AEOWpy.jpg?resize=1024%2C576" width="1024" />
<p>Even with the bearish outlook, some analysts are <a href="https://twitter.com/TrendRidersTR/status/1774780502186074437" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">bullish</a>. After a period of sluggishness, the 2-week chart is flashing green, mirroring the green wave seen at the beginning of the 2020 bull run. </p>

<title>Dogecoin MVRV Ratio Turns Negative – Here’s What It Means For DOGE’s Price</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-mvrv-ratio-negative/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-mvrv-ratio-negative/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的<br />从3月31日以来，狗狗币价格下跌了21％，导致MVRV比率变负。虽然这可能引发投资者情绪恶化和卖压增加，但对于长期投资者来说，这可能是一次巨大的买入机会。过去的行为表明，MVRV比率转负后往往会引发价格反弹。当前的市场走势显示DOGE交易在一个紧密区间之中，可能会在短期内下跌至$0.125，或者上涨重新测试$0.22水平。 <div>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-bullish-fractal-returns/">Dogecoin</a> has been <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-price-crashing-down/">stuck in a price correction</a> since March 31, falling by 21% from $0.2214. This has seen DOGE falling across a number of metrics, including the MVRV ratio. The MVRV ratio <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-top-yet-legendary-mvrv-ratio-says/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">recently turned negative</a>, a condition that indicates many holders are currently at a loss. This might sound bad, but it could actually be a massive buy opportunity for long-term investors of the meme cryptocurrency. </p>
<h2>Dogecoin MVRV Ratio Turns Negative: Why Does This Matter?</h2>
<p>Data has shown DOGE falling to the negative side of its MVRV ratio. According to price data provided by Santiment, an on-chain analytics company, DOGE&#8217;s MVRV ratio fell quickly to a low of 15.36% on April 4. </p>


<p>The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-mvrv-suggests-rally-may-have-more-room-grow/">MVRV ratio </a>compares an asset&#8217;s market capitalization to its realized capitalization, giving insight into investor sentiment and the potential for price rallies. For DOGE, it divides Dogecoin&#8217;s current market cap by the realized value of all the coins in the market. At the time of writing, Dogecoin has a market cap of $24.9 billion. Although still the largest of all meme coins, Dogecoin&#8217;s market cap has fallen by almost 20% in the past seven days.</p>
<p>When the ratio turns negative, it often means investor sentiment has soured, and selling pressure is prevailing. However, it also indicates DOGE is trading at a discount relative to historical investment costs. For long-term investors, this can present a chance to buy DOGE at a price below its average realized price. On the other hand, very high positive DOGE MVRV ratios have often led to significant price pullbacks.</p>
<p>In the past, these periods of negative MVRV were followed by significant price rallies. Consequently, past action has seen DOGE go on a price recovery shortly after falling from the -5% to -15% range. The last time DOGE fell to -15% on the MVRV ratio was during a 31% price drop, which lasted from March 14 to March 20. During this period, the meme currency reached a value of $0.1251. However, the meme coin reversed course just shortly after and went on a 78% price surge over seven days to reach $0.2262 on March 28.</p>
<h2>What’s Next For DOGE?</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, DOGE is trading at $0.1738. <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-mirrors-2021-12/">Recent price action </a>has seen the meme coin navigating a tight zone and a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-major-roadblock/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">massive selling spree from whales</a>. DOGE is now trading just above a support zone just above $0.17. A break of this price level to the downside could mean DOGE falling to as low as $0.125 again in the short term. </p>

<p>On the other hand, the end of the current market consolidation could <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/time-to-get-into-dogecoin/">reignite interest in DOGE </a>and buying volume. As a result, the price could easily retest the $0.22 level.</p>

<title>Sony Bank Leverages Polygon Blockchain For Stablecoin Pilot Program</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/sony-bank-leverages-polygon-blockchain-stablecoin/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/sony-bank-leverages-polygon-blockchain-stablecoin/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。索尼银行宣布进军稳定币领域，与SettleMint合作在Polygon区块链上进行试点发行稳定币。该举措表明了索尼银行战略性专注于利用区块链和数字资产来增加金融服务。同时，Polygon区块链的稳定币市值已超过15.11亿美元，MATIC代币交易量和市值均呈正增长趋势。索尼的区块链技术和Web3应用发展计划也得到了支持。 <div>
<p>According to local media <a href="https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUB02D980S4A400C2000000/?n_cid=SNSTW005" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reports</a> in Japan, Sony Bank announced its foray into the stablecoin world, launching a trial to issue its fiat-linked digital currency. In collaboration with blockchain company SettleMint, one of the most notable aspects of the pilot program is that the trial will take place on the Polygon blockchain.</p>
<h2>Sony Bank&#8217;s Strategic Move</h2>
<p>Sony Bank&#8217;s move to explore stablecoin issuance highlights the company&#8217;s strategic focus on leveraging <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/jp-morgan-reason-ethereum-not-security/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">blockchain technology</a> and digital assets to increase its financial services offerings. </p>
<p>By pegging the stablecoin to traditional fiat currencies such as the Japanese yen, Sony Bank aims to reduce <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-existential-moment-co-founder-speaks-out/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">transaction fees</a> and facilitate instant payments and remittances for individuals and businesses.</p>

<p>Jun Watanabe, president and representative director of Sony Network and founder of the Web3 platform Astar Network, <a href="https://x.com/WatanabeSota/status/1776048966054154365" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">expressed </a>the company&#8217;s ambitious plans, stating: </p>
<blockquote><p>Sony Bank plans to launch a stablecoin, and Sony plans to launch a blockchain with us. It is getting ready. </p></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, Watanabe <a href="https://x.com/WatanabeSota/status/1776067605490811067" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">emphasized </a>the potential of leveraging existing assets and services, rather than starting from scratch, as the most effective means of bringing billions of users into the Web3 ecosystem. </p>
<p>This latest development aligns with Sony&#8217;s ongoing efforts to embrace blockchain technology and Web3 applications. Last year, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sony-invests-in-startale-labs-for-web3-adoption/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoinist </a>reported that Sony Network Communications partnered with Japanese Web3 technology company Startale Labs to support the advancement of Startale&#8217;s services and product development. </p>
<p>The partnership focused on developing all-in-one solutions for Web3 development and prioritizing integrating real-world assets into the decentralized ecosystem.</p>
<p>While Polygon has refrained from making detailed statements about the partnership as of this writing, the project&#8217;s reposting of the collaboration announcement on social media site X (formerly Twitter) reaffirms its support for the initiative.</p>
<h2>Polygon&#8217;s Stablecoin Market Cap Surpasses $1.5 Billion</h2>
<p>As of the latest <a href="https://defillama.com/stablecoins/Polygon" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">data </a>from DefiLlama, the Polygon blockchain has established a stablecoin market capitalization of $1.511 billion. Over the past week, however, there has been a slight decline of 1.44% in the market capitalization. </p>
<p>On the other hand, Tether&#8217;s USDT stablecoin continues to dominate the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/2024-crypto-boom-coinledger-study-unveils-portfolio/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">stablecoin market</a> with a commanding 52.16% market share.</p>
<p>Token Terminal <a href="https://tokenterminal.com/terminal/projects/polygon" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">data </a>also reveals additional metrics highlighting Polygon&#8217;s performance. The fully diluted market capitalization, representing the maximum potential value of the tokens in circulation, stands at $9.04 billion, reflecting a 13.0% decrease over the past 30 days. </p>
<img alt="Polygon " class="size-large wp-image-292291" height="361" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot_95.jpg?w=642&#038;resize=642%2C361" width="642" />
<p>Meanwhile, the circulating market capitalization, which considers the active circulation tokens, is valued at $8.93 billion, showing the same 13.0% decrease.</p>

<p>On the trading front, Polygon&#8217;s native token MATIC has seen a positive trend in token trading volume over the past 30 days. The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bullish-accumulation-addresses-buying-big/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">trading volume</a> during this period amounted to $19.66 billion, marking a notable increase of 13.1%.</p>
<img alt="Polygon " class="size-large" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/ldYEbfA7/" width="1815" />
<p>MATIC is experiencing a lack of bullish momentum, coinciding with the overall market&#8217;s price correction. The cryptocurrency trades at $0.8824, representing a 3.5% price decline in the past 24 hours. </p>
<p>Notably, MATIC stands among the few largest cryptocurrencies that have witnessed year-to-date negative figures, with a 22.8% price decline over this period, according to CoinGecko <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/polygon" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">data</a>.</p>

<title>Shiba Inu On The Brink Of Crashing As Multiple On-Chain Metrics Turn Red</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-brink-of-crashing/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-brink-of-crashing/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。Shiba Inu的网络增长下降，许多持有者正在抛售他们的代币。大宗交易活动也在减少，而鲸鱼持有者似乎不再积累更多代币。尽管如此，买盘量不平衡的信号是积极的，暗示着一波购买订单可能会推动价格回升。一些分析师仍然认为SHIB在本市场周期中将成为领涨者。 <div>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-bitcoin-dogecoin/">Shiba Inu (SHIB)</a> is at risk of further price declines based on several on-chain metrics, signaling a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/why-is-shiba-inu-price-down-today/">bearish sentiment</a> in the ecosystem. This could no doubt present a setback for the meme coin, which is showing <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-turns-bullish-crypto/">signs of recovery</a> following a significant price correction. </p>
<h2>Shiba Inu Network Growth Is On The Decline</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://app.intotheblock.com/coin/SHIB" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">data</a> from the market intelligence platform <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-difficulty-drops-miners-expand-halving/">IntoTheBlock</a>, Shiba Inu’s net network growth has declined by 0.48%. This metric measures the total number of addresses holding the SHIB token, and a decline shows that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-whale-transactions-2/#:~:text=Shiba%20Inu%20is%20home%20to,move%20large%20amounts%20of%20coins.">some addresses</a> have offloaded their tokens in the past week. </p>

<p>The ‘In The Money’ metric also signals a bearish sentiment in the SHIB ecosystem, with a 0.20% decline in the past week. This metric measures how many SHIB holders are in profit, and right now, it seems that most of them are at a loss with their SHIB holdings. However, this metric could quickly turn bullish again as <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-surge-crypto-shib/#:~:text=Shiba%20Inu%20To%20See%20A%20300%25%20Gain%20Before%20Year%2Dend&amp;text=Looking%20at%20SHIB&#039;s%20chart%2C%20the,invest%20in%20the%20crypto%20token.">SHIB moves to the upside</a>.</p>
<p>The number of large transactions on the network is another metric highlighting the bearish sentiment in the SHIB ecosystem. Data from IntoTheBlock shows that whale activity on the network has declined by over 10% this past week. In this context, a large transaction refers to one of over $100,000, meaning that <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-whales-shib/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">whales’ activity</a> on the network has cooled off. </p>
<p>The decline in this metric is concerning, considering that Shiba Inu whales <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-whale-transactions-2/#:~:text=Shiba%20Inu%20is%20home%20to,move%20large%20amounts%20of%20coins.">reportedly</a> hold 73% of the token’s circulating supply and play a major role in SHIB’s price discovery. Meanwhile, the cool-off in whale activity on the network is also evident in the ‘Concentration’ metric, which is neither bullish nor bearish at the moment, according to IntoTheBlock’s data.</p>
<p>The Concentration metric measures daily changes in the position of whales, meaning that SHIB whales are currently opting against accumulating more of the meme coin in their portfolio. </p>
<h2>The Silver Lining</h2>
<p>Data from IntoTheBlock shows that the ‘Bid-Ask Volume Imbalance’ is currently bullish, suggesting that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-bitcoin-dogecoin/">SHIB investors</a> are again accumulating the meme coin. This is a positive development as the buy orders can help trigger a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/122000-surge-shiba-inu-price/">surge in SHIB’s price</a>. Moreover, the other on-chain signals could again turn bullish following an increase in <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/expect-shiba-inu-in-april/">SHIB’s value</a>. </p>

<p>It is also worth noting that the overall outlook for the SHIB token remains bullish. Several crypto analysts <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-surge-crypto-shib/#:~:text=Shiba%20Inu%20To%20See%20A%20300%25%20Gain%20Before%20Year%2Dend&amp;text=Looking%20at%20SHIB&#039;s%20chart%2C%20the,invest%20in%20the%20crypto%20token.">predict</a> that the meme coin will be among the leading gainers in this market cycle. Crypto analysts like Altcoin Sherpa have even <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-flip-dogecoin-shib/">predicted</a> that SHIB could eventually replace Dogecoin (DOGE) as the most valuable meme coin. </p>
<p>At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at around $0.00002667, up in the last 24 hours according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/shiba-inu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">data</a> from CoinMarketCap. </p>

<title>Australian Asset Manager To Launch Bitcoin ETF On Cboe In Q2</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/australian-asset-manager-to-launch-bitcoin-etf-on-cboe-in-q2/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/australian-asset-manager-to-launch-bitcoin-etf-on-cboe-in-q2/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />澳大利亚资产管理公司Monochrome近日宣布与Cboe Australia合作，在2024年第二季度申请上市比特币交易所交易基金（ETF）。此举旨在加深该公司在亚太地区的影响力。Monochrome首次计划将其比特币ETF列入澳大利亚证券交易所（ASX），但由于ASX的批准流程更为漫长，他们选择了与Cboe Australia合作。该ETF旨在通过“被经验支持的敞口”提供对比特币的投资，采取被动买入和持有的策略。这些信息表明，受到美国SPOT比特币ETF的成功影响，比特币ETF将受到更加优待。<br /> <div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Australian asset manager Monochrome recently announced the application with Cboe Australia to list a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) in Q2 2024.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The “strategic move” of its flagship product to Cboe aims to deepen the firm&#8217;s reach around the Asia-Pacific region.</p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">A Change of Plans: From ASX To Cboe</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In July 2023, the Australian asset manager firm Monochrome <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/monochrome-vasco-first-spot-bitcoin-etf-australia/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">re-filed</a> for its Monochrome Bitcoin ETF (IBTC) amid growing interest in the products. Around the same time, its counterparts in the US were submitting their applications to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The re-filing came after the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) regulatory framework was updated to allow crypto-asset exchange-traded products.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Today, Monochrome <a href="https://www.monochrome.au/news/articles/monochrome-announces-strategic-move-to-cboe-australia-for-flagship-bitcoin-etf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> its “strategic move” to Cboe Australia for its flagship product, IBTC. The Australian arm is one of Cboe Global Markets’ five global listing exchanges.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It’s worth noting that Australia’s application process differs from that of the US. Australian firms should get approval from the national regulator first before applying to be listed on an Exchange.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Monochrome had first planned to list its Bitcoin ETF on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). ASX typically holds much higher trading volumes than Cboe Australia in the country.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">However, ASX’s process to approve Bitcoin ETF is seemingly longer and more complicated. As <a href="https://www.investordaily.com.au/markets/54772-investment-managers-jostle-to-deliver-first-asx-listed-bitcoin-etf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reported</a> by local outlets, VanEck has been attempting to bring a spot BTC ETF to ASX since 2021.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Arian Neiron, chief executive and managing director of VanEck Asia-Pacific, said, &#8220;approval for an ASX-listed bitcoin ETF is not imminent.” Neiron considers that many regulatory and exchange issues must be addressed “before we see a bitcoin ETF on ASX.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Brisbane-based firm commented on its selection of Cboe as their <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/coinbase-stock-dips-5-as-jpmorgan-takes-bearish/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">listing venue</a>.  Monochrome emphasized “key factors” aligning the exchange and the firm goals. The firm CEO, Jeff Yew, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We are proud to work with Cboe Australia to bring Monochrome&#8217;s new bitcoin ETF to market, expanding the investment universe for Australian Investors. As leaders in digital assets globally, their established track record and commitment to innovation and safe market accessibility aligns with Monochrome’s strategic objectives.</p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin ETFs To Receive A More Favorable Welcome</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Monochrome’s flagship investment product aims to allow “exposure backed by experience.” According to its <a href="https://www.monochrome.au/products/monochrome-bitcoin-etf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, IBTC’s regulated exposure will offer “passive investment” to the flagship cryptocurrency.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The fund will have a “passive buy and hold” approach. This strategy won’t involve trading, derivatives, or short-term price speculation. Moreover, the firm affirms that it works closely with external businesses and technical expert advisors.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">If approved, IBTC would be the first of its kind in the country. The fund is proposed for launch in Q2 2024, but the date remains subject to regulatory approvals. Similarly, the fund’s quotation will be conditioned by the market operator and regulatory approval.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/will-hong-kongs-bitcoin-etfs-outshine-us-peers/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">successful launch</a> of Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US has broadened adoption and interest in crypto-based investment products. Asset management firms are waiting for regulatory institutions worldwide to approve their applications or update their regulatory framework.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Notably, The Independent Reserve Cryptocurrency Index (IRCI) Australia 2024 revealed that 25% of Australians see Bitcoin more favorably after the approval and success of ETFs in the US. The annual study “examines Australian attitudes towards cryptocurrency, as well as their level of awareness, adoption, trust and confidence in the growing market.”</p>

<p><img alt="BTC, bitcoin " class="size-large wp-image-292303 aligncenter" height="552" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Captura-de-Pantalla-2024-04-05-a-las-9.50.35-a.-m.png?w=820&#038;resize=820%2C552" width="820" /></p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">According to the study, many of the interviewed people had a “more favorable perception of Bitcoin.” The change in perspective includes the older generation, as Australians 55 and older are “warming up” to the flagship cryptocurrency and crypto investments.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Volume 6.2x Less Than 2021 Peak Despite Comparable Prices: Data</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-volume-6-2x-2021-peak-despite-prices-data/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-volume-6-2x-2021-peak-despite-prices-data/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。文章指出比特币的总交易量远低于2021年牛市高峰时期的水平。目前，比特币的总转账量仅达到了1180亿美元的高点，远低于2021年牛市高峰时的7400亿美元。可能原因是新的比特币交易所交易基金（ETFs）带来了新的需求，但这些新投资者无法通过链上操作反映在转账量上。比特币价格最近恢复到69000美元以上，但已经回落至66600美元左右。 <div>
<p>On-chain data shows the Bitcoin transfer volume remains significantly lower than that observed at comparable prices during the 2021 bull run peak.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Total Transfer Volume Has So Far Hit A High Of Just $118 Billion</h2>
<p>As pointed out by CryptoQuant author Axel Adler Jr in a <a href="https://twitter.com/AxelAdlerJr/status/1776157526095987027/photo/1" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, the total transfer volume of this bull run hasn&#8217;t been able to reach anywhere near the peak of the previous one.</p>
<p>The &#8220;<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/by-the-numbers-how-volume-bitcoin-settled-lifetime/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">total transfer volume</a>&#8221; here refers to the total amount of Bitcoin that&#8217;s becoming involved in transactions on the network every day. The metric is measured in terms of the US Dollar (USD).</p>

<p>Below is the chart shared by the analyst that shows the trend in this indicator over the last couple of cycles:</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Total Transfer Volume" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="1290" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GKYt2tCWgAAH7D_?format=jpg&amp;name=large" width="2048" /></p>

<p>From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that the Bitcoin total transfer volume has been going up over the last few months. This is normal behavior for rallies, as the network tends to become more active during such periods due to an influx of new users and repositioning from some of the existing holders.</p>
<p>The opposite is usually the case in <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-halving-could-lead-to-major-bear-market/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">bear markets</a>, as extended drawdowns and long stretches of boring consolidation all result in the general investors steering clear of the cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>As is apparent in the chart, the indicator&#8217;s value had also naturally been rising during the 2017 and 2021 bull runs. At the height of the latter rally around November 2021, the BTC total transfer volume had set a high of around $740 billion. This means that, at that point, the blockchain was processing the movement of capital worth $740 billion per day. This peak is still the all-time high (ATH) for the metric.</p>
<p>In its latest rally, BTC has recently managed to set a brand new price ATH, and it&#8217;s still trading not far from these highs. Despite this, though, the peak in the total transfer volume observed so far is just $118 billion. This is only around 16% of the ATH value registered at the height of the 2021 bull run, while the price levels witnessed recently have been comparable to back then. What this implies is that the demand for trading on the network is much less currently than back then.</p>
<p>As the chart shows, when the 2021 bull run first surpassed the ATH set in the 2017 bull run, its volume attained similar levels as during the previous peak. Why, then, is the current bull run different in this pattern?</p>
<p>A potential factor could be the presence of the Bitcoin <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/who-will-go-first-morgan-stanley-salty-as-ubs-joins-the-bitcoin-etf-race/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs)</a> this time around. The spot ETFs, which found approval back in January, buy and hold BTC, and allow their users to gain indirect exposure to the cryptocurrency in a mode that&#8217;s familiar to traditional investors.</p>

<p>The spot ETFs have brought significant demand into the asset, but these new investors are different from the usual holders of the cryptocurrency who actively participate in the network.</p>
<p>The fresh demand through the spot ETFs is all &#8220;off-chain,&#8221; so to speak, as the ones holding their coins are the funds themselves, meaning that these new investors can&#8217;t exactly make on-chain manipulations that would end up reflecting on the transfer volume.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>Bitcoin had recovered back above the $69,000 level yesterday, but it would appear that the asset has already lost these gains as it&#8217;s now trading around $66,600 again.</p>

<title>Crypto Analyst Says Bitcoin Will Continue To Rise, ‘2024 Is A Bullish Year’</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-continue-to-rise-2024/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-continue-to-rise-2024/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />Bitcoin自达到新的高点$73,750后一直在横盘交易，引发担忧BTC的牛市势头可能是短暂的。然而，文章指出了BTC价格将持续上涨至年底的原因。分析师表示2024年是BTC的牛市年，主要因素包括大选年股市表现良好和可能的降息导致投资者有更多资金投资风险资产。另一位分析师预测BTC的顶点将在2025年达到，强调今年价格上涨不可避免，价格波动不意味着牛市结束。截至目前，Bitcoin价格约为$67,600，24小时内上涨3%。 <div>
<p>Bitcoin has continued to trade sideways since hitting a new <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-breaks-through-69000-setting-new-record/">all-time high (ATH)</a> of $73,750. That has raised concerns that BTC&#8217;s bullish momentum <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bull-market-glassnode/">in this bull run</a> may be shortlived. However, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/analyst-foresees-ethereum-will-make-millionaires/">crypto analyst Lark Davis</a> has outlined reasons why BTC&#8217;s price will keep soaring till the remainder of the year. </p>
<h2>Why 2024 Is A Bullish Year For Bitcoin</h2>
<p>In a video <a href="https://x.com/TheCryptoLark/status/1775939103185379536" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">posted</a> on his X (formerly Twitter) platform, Davis revealed that two other events, besides the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-whales-buying-spree/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Bitcoin Halving</a>, will push the bull market even further and cause BTC&#8217;S price to keep rising. For the first, he highlighted that the stock market performs positively 83% of the time in an election year. </p>

<p>While recognizing that this factor usually pertains to stocks, he noted that BTC has become part of Wall Street (with the Spot Bitcoin ETFs and institutional interest). He further claimed that BTC is moving in line with traditional markets. Therefore, Bitcoin’s price, like the stock market, could continue to react positively ahead of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/2024-us-elections-ignite-crypto-generosity/">US election</a> in November. </p>
<p>The second event he mentioned is a potential cut in interest rates based on <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/goldman-sachs-remains-bullish-on-bitcoin/">Goldman Sach’s prediction</a>. The investment bank predicted that there will be three rate reductions this year, with the first likely to come in June. This means that investors will have more capital to invest in risk assets like Bitcoin and other crypto assets. </p>
<p>An injection of more liquidity into the crypto market could potentially spark a remarkable surge in BTC&#8217;s price. This is evident in how much the flagship crypto’s price skyrocketed following the launch of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etf-frenzy-waning-investors-shifting-focus/">Spot Bitcoin ETFs</a>, which ushered in new money from <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/institutional-buyers-of-bitcoin/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">institutional investors</a>. </p>
<h2>BTC&#8217;s Bullish Momentum To Extend To 2025</h2>
<p>Crypto analyst PlanB, in his <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-100000-in-2024/#:~:text=Bitcoin%20To%20%24100%2C000%20Is%20%E2%80%9CInevitable%E2%80%9D&amp;text=He%20noted%20that%20the%20Bitcoin,average%20price%20level%20for%20Bitcoin.&amp;text=However%2C%20he%20added%20that%20this,year%20but%20sometime%20in%202025." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">recent analysis</a>, also showed why fears of a short-lived bull season may be unfounded. According to the analyst, the BTC top will not come until sometime in 2025. Interestingly, he predicted that <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-reach-1-million/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Bitcoin could rise to $1 million</a> at the peak of the bull market. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, PlanB stated that <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-100000-cardano-dead/#:~:text=Why%20Cardano%20Is%20Dead,non%2Dexistent%E2%80%9D%20on%20it." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Bitcoin rising to $100,000</a> and even higher this year is “inevitable,” which aligns with Davis’ prediction that 2024 will be a bullish year for BTC. The analyst also tried to allay fears about Bitcoin’s price action, remarking that sharp price corrections <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crash-10-69000/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">are normal</a> even in a bull market and don’t mean the bull cycle is over. </p>
<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $67,600, up over 3% in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap.  </p>

<title>Crackdown On Crypto: New Wave Of Operation Choke Point 2.0 Is Underway</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/crackdown-crypto-new-wave-choke-point-2-0/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。美国银行似乎正在采取协调的行动，试图与涉及数字货币的企业切断联系。John Paller因与加密相关的账户而被Wells Fargo关闭，引发了行业内的连锁反应。Gabor Gurbacs和Caitlin Long也报道了类似的情况，指出银行业似乎在采取针对加密企业的行动。Custodia Bank也在与美联储争夺主账户的法律斗争中遭遇挫折，这被认为是对加密行业整体融入传统金融系统抱有希望的挫败。 <div>
<p>Prominent figures within the crypto community are raising alarms over what appears to be a new wave coordinated effort by US banks to systematically dissociate from businesses dealing in digital currencies. Operation Choke Point 2.0 which began last year, is a concerted government effort involving the Biden White House, several agencies, the Federal Reserve and influential members of Congress that aims to restrict crypto&#8217;s fiat access, thus potentially suffocating the industry.</p>
<h2>Operation Choke Point 2.0 Underway Again</h2>
<p>The recent outcry was ignited by John Paller, the founder and Executive Steward of ETHDenver and Opolis, who shared his personal ordeal with Wells Fargo on X (formerly Twitter). Paller detailed how, after &#8220;26 YEARS of patronage,&#8221; Wells Fargo abruptly terminated all of his accounts, including personal, business, and non-profit without providing a clear explanation.</p>
<p>Paller&#8217;s relationship with the bank, which involved millions in fees over the years, was severed in a manner that left him questioning the motives behind the bank&#8217;s decision. He said, &#8220;I suspect that it’s because my name was all over the Opolis accounts that were also closed last year due to crypto affiliation although we were told it was some other BS reason.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">After 26 YEARS of patronage, and paying millions in fees to them over that time, <a href="https://twitter.com/WellsFargo?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">@WellsFargo</a> debanked me without explanation.

<p></p>
<p>Gabor Gurbacs, founder of PointsVille and advisor to Tether and VanEck, <a href="https://twitter.com/gaborgurbacs/status/1776053334148817337" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">corroborated</a> Paller&#8217;s assertions, confirming an industry-wide phenomenon of &#8220;quietly de-platforming businesses that have anything to do with crypto, even services.&#8221; Gurbacs added, “Operation chokepoint 2.0. is back.” This statement points to a broader, systemic issue within the banking industry, which seems to be acting in a concerted manner against the cryptocurrency sector.</p>

<p>The situation took on further gravity with Caitlin Long, CEO of Custodia Bank, entering the conversation. Long, a veteran in the blockchain space and founder of a bank that aims to bridge cryptocurrencies with traditional banking, <a href="https://twitter.com/CaitlinLong_/status/1774134449506033845" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reported</a> an uptick in inquiries from crypto companies displaced by their banks.</p>
<p>&#8220;John—sorry to hear. Custodia has seen a marked uptick in inquiries in the past ~2 weeks from #crypto companies urgently seeking to replace bank accounts closed by their banks,&#8221; she said, suggesting an orchestrated effort against the industry.</p>
<p>Long&#8217;s insights underline a disturbing trend of financial exclusion that is not only immediate in its impact but also suggestive of a larger, perhaps politically motivated, campaign against crypto enterprises. Yesterday, Long reiterated via X:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>CONFIRMED. There is *definitely* a witch hunt underway to debank fintech &amp; crypto companies in the US. It&#8217;s very political. It&#8217;s illegal, wrong &amp; may violate the FDIC&#8217;s 2019 Operation Choke Point lawsuit settlement. Debanking should be an election issue in November.”</strong></p></blockquote>
Custodia Bank Fights For The Crypto Industry
<p>Adding to the controversy is Custodia Bank&#8217;s own legal battle for banking equality. The bank&#8217;s quest for a Federal Reserve master account — a pivotal asset for any banking institution seeking autonomy from intermediaries — <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/custodia-bank-loses-claim-to-a-fed-master-account/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">was recently thwarted</a>. A federal judge in Wyoming ruled against Custodia, asserting that the Federal Reserve is not compelled to grant access to its master account system to every eligible depository institution.</p>

<p>This decision was met with criticism from various quarters, including <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/us-sec-rejects-skybridges-bitcoin-etf/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">SkyBridge</a>’s Anthony Scaramucci and former Senator Pat Toomey, who perceived it as a setback for the crypto industry&#8217;s broader ambitions for integration within the traditional financial system.</p>
<p>Scaramucci, via X, <a href="https://twitter.com/Scaramucci/status/1775893165301780608" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">criticized</a> the Kansas City Federal Reserve&#8217;s rejection of Custodia&#8217;s application as &#8220;arbitrarily and capriciously&#8221; motivated by a distaste for crypto. &#8220;Judge [&#8230;]did a complete 180 on the prior decision. Raises major questions about legality of Fed and potential political pressure from <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-deaton-sen-warren-cover-up-sbf/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Sen E. Warren</a> acolytes.</p>
<p>Similarly, Toomey expressed his dissatisfaction with the legal outcome, telling FOX Business, &#8220;it was contradictory and inconsistent with his decision in June when he denied the Fed’s request to dismiss the case. There’s no logic here at all, and I hope Custodia decides to appeal.&#8221;</p>
<p>At press time, Bitcoin traded at $66,771.</p>

<title>CEO Firestorm: Ripple Leader Lambasts Crypto News Site For ‘Embarrassing’ Content</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章讨论了Ripple（XRP代币背后的公司）宣布进军稳定币领域引发了加密货币世界的轩然大波。Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse批评了Coindesk的文章，称其为行业的一个耻辱。该文章质疑Ripple的未来和XRP的命运，但也指出了Ripple推出的稳定币计划以及其在与美国证监会的法律斗争中的应对策略。此外，提到了XRP在加密货币市场中的重要地位，并强调了其继续与美国运通等机构合作的意义。 <div>
<p>A firestorm erupted in the cryptocurrency world this week after Ripple, the company behind the XRP token, announced its foray into stablecoins. The move sparked a public spat with Coindesk, a prominent cryptocurrency news outlet, raising questions about Ripple&#8217;s future and the fate of XRP.</p>

<h2><strong>Ripple Boss Slams CoinDesk Article</strong></h2>
<p>Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse took to the X social media platform to criticize a Coindesk article portraying their stablecoin venture as a sign of desperation. He called the article &#8220;embarrassing for the industry,&#8221; suggesting it undermines professionalism within the cryptocurrency space.</p>
<p>Garlinghouse added in his X post:</p>
<blockquote>
&#8220;Childish antics masquerading under what should be a credible brand that leads coverage of the crypto industry.&#8221;
</blockquote>
<p>The Coindesk article, authored by Daniel Kuhn, deputy managing editor for Consensus Magazine, suggests Ripple&#8217;s embrace of stablecoins signifies the potential demise of XRP.</p>
<p>Kuhn argues that Ripple, facing a legal battle with the US Securities and Exchange Commission over XRP&#8217;s classification as a security, might be seeking new revenue streams.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>It&#8217;s embarrassing for the industry. But as <a href="https://twitter.com/Kirjakulov?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">@Kirjakulov</a> points out &#8211; these are the kinds of people (a &#8216;deputy editor&#8217;) holding the whole industry back.</p>

<p></p>
<h2><strong>The Ripple Stablecoin: At A Glance</strong></h2>
<p>With complete backing from US dollar deposits, US government short-term bonds, and comparable cash equivalents, the planned Ripple stablecoin seeks to satisfy the growing market for dependable and safe digital assets.</p>
<p>With the intention of eventually expanding to other platforms, Ripple intends to initially make the stablecoin available on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) and Ethereum (ETH) blockchains, leveraging its vast experience in creating financial solutions for institutions across the globe.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/Qz4HNi4Z/" width="1835" /></p>

<strong>Ripple Still Pushing Forward</strong>
<p>In its article, Coindesk raises doubts about Ripple&#8217;s core product, On-Demand Liquidity, which aims to facilitate faster and cheaper cross-border payments for financial institutions.</p>
<p>The article claims ODL has failed to gain significant traction, with &#8220;legitimate&#8221; financial institutions wary of XRP&#8217;s volatility. It also highlights the dissolution of partnerships with Santander and MoneyGram, casting a shadow over Ripple&#8217;s ability to secure future collaborations.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">So&#8230;. I have read Coindesk&#8217;s article&#8230;. It paints a rather bleak picture of Ripple and XRP, suggesting Ripple is scrambling for relevance with its new stablecoin venture. But let&#8217;s dive into the claims and add some much-needed context:</p>

<p></p>
<p>Artur Kirjakulov, co-founder of XPMarket.com, emphasized Ripple&#8217;s resilience in the face of challenges:</p>
<blockquote>
&#8220;Ripple isn&#8217;t giving up. They&#8217;re constantly exploring new opportunities.&#8221;
</blockquote>

<strong>Legal Woes, New Strategies: Can Ripple Weather The Storm?</strong>
<p>The clash between Ripple and Coindesk underscores the complex dynamics within the cryptocurrency industry. While Ripple navigates the legal battle with the SEC, the company&#8217;s decision to enter the stablecoin market raises questions about the future of XRP.</p>
<p>XRP proponents were quick to defend the company. They pointed to Ripple&#8217;s ongoing partnership with American Express, a major financial institution, as evidence of their continued relevance.</p>

<title>Shiba Inu Burn Rate Breaks Down 28% With Only 5 Transactions As Price Turns Red</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。Shiba Inu的销毁率在一周的良好动能之后出现负面转变，可能与这段时间内价格下跌有关。从数据显示，销毁率下降了28%，在一天内仅有5个交易中发生。价格下跌可能导致投资者观望，而SHIB价格在过去一周下跌了约12%。然而，有预测认为SHIB可能会上涨超过2,000%。 <div>
<p class="p2">The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-burn-rate-17000/">Shiba Inu burn rate</a> has turned negative after a rather good week of momentum. This downturn in the burn rate is a deviation from the established trend this week and could have something to do with the decline in the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-flip-dogecoin-shib/">SHIB price</a> during this time.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Shiba Inu Burn Rate Drops 28%</h2>
<p class="p2">The burn rate saw a significant decline between Thursday and Friday after the number of burn transactions fell. Over the 24-hour period, there was a total of 14.37 <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/why-is-shiba-inu-price-down-today/">SHIB</a> burned, which translates to a 28.05% decline from the prior day’s figures, according to <a href="https://www.shibburn.com/btx/0xafefcce1fd34cbc3883ec982d8e3edcf3f9f8ffb77462c472fb86181eb7d1402#google_vignette" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">data</a> from the Shiba Inu burn tracking website, Shibburn.</p>

<p class="p2">These burns only happened across a total of five transactions for the whole day, with a single wallet carrying out the majority of the burns across two transactions. The “0xa9d1e” wallet first burned a little over 7.83 million <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-whale-transactions-2/">SHIB</a> tokens. And then, in the next transaction, the same wallet burned another 5.244 million <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-whale-transactions-2/">SHIB tokens</a>.</p>
<p class="p2">Three other burn transactions were also recorded during this time period but their figures were much lower, all coming in below a million. The highest of the trio sent around 922,679 tokens to the burn address, another sent 192,110 tokens to the burn address, and the lowest was a transaction carrying 185,839 tokens.</p>
<p class="p2"><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-burn-rate-99-crash/">SHIB’s burn rate decline</a> is in stark contrast to the trends that were recorded earlier in the week, with burn rate surging over 100% on a daily basis. However, there is still an upside on the weekly chart as the burn tracker shows 240.688 million tokens have been burned in the last week, a 9.66% increase from the previous week.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p></p>
<h2 class="p2">SHIB Downtrend Could Be The Reason For The Decline</h2>
<p class="p2">One factor that could be driving the decline in the Shiba Inu burn rate could be the drop in price. Usually, when prices of a crypto asset are down, it often leads to decreased participation for investors as they wait out the bear trend. Given that the SHIB price has dropped around 12% in the last week, it is no surprise that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-flip-dogecoin-shib/">SHIB</a> investors are choosing to sit on their hands.</p>

<p class="p2">The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/why-is-shiba-inu-price-down-today/">Shiba Inu price is now sitting below $0.000027,</a> which was an important support level for the coin. However, bears have been able to turn this price point into resistance, which makes it the level to beat for the meme coin going forward.</p>
<p class="p2">Nevertheless, bullish sentiment continues to prevail as crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa sees a future where the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-flip-dogecoin-shib/">SHIB price grows enough that its market cap eventually flips that of its biggest rival, Dogecoin</a>. The crypto analyst predicts that SHIB could rise more than 2,000% from its current price level, which could put it as high as $0.0004.</p>

<title>Shiba Inu Takes Center Stage As Social Activity Spikes, Price Uptick Imminent?</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-takes-social-activity-spikes/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。Shiba Inu作为一种受欢迎的模因币，展示出了社会活动的激增，显示其作为加密货币行业领先币之一的地位。Shiba Inu社交活动上升，社区呈现出更强大的活跃度。据LunarCrush称，SHIB显示出看涨趋势，有4个积极指标。此外，Shiba Inu已成为受欢迎的模因币，在社交媒体上拥有庞大的粉丝群体和社区支持。最近，SHIB在欧盟成为第二受欢迎的数字资产，显示其在市场上的地位。 <div>
<p>Popular meme coin <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-founder-shiba-inu/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Shiba Inu (SHIB)</a> is exhibiting significant adoption as the crypto asset is witnessing a surge in social activity, demonstrating its stance as one of the leading coins in the cryptocurrency industry.</p>
<h2>Shiba Inu Social Activity On The Rise</h2>
<p>The development was<a href="https://x.com/Shibtoken/status/1775977537388130536" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> reported</a> by Shiba Inu&#8217;s team on the X (formerly Twitter) noting that SHIB social activity is buzzing. This simply suggests that the meme coin is experiencing an increase in interest from community members and investors.</p>

<p>According to the team, the SHIB community also recognized as <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-latest-developments-2/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">SHIBArmy</a> is stronger than it has ever been due to the recent uptick in social activity. Thus, they urged the community to continue spreading the word and let the world witness the SHIBArmy&#8217;s overwhelming strength.</p>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shib-magazine/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Shiba Inu&#8217;s team</a> post came in light of leading social intelligence platform LunarCrush&#8217;s post regarding SHIB signaling bullish trends. LunarCrush has identified four distinct positive indicators that suggest SHIB could be rallying anytime soon. These include increasing social activity, rising price action, accelerating market volume, and a very strong LunarCrush AltRankTM of 2.</p>
<p>It is important to note that Shiba Inu has become a very popular meme coin with a devoted fan base and community support. Remarkably, based on social engagement, the digital asset has continuously been rated as one of the best cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>SHIB has gained a lot of awareness and appeal among crypto aficionados thanks to its distinctive branding and active social media presence. With millions of interactions on social media platforms such as X, Discord, and Reddit, it is among the most well-liked cryptocurrency assets on these sites.</p>
<p>In mid-December last year, almost 24,000 postings on SHIB were made on these websites and other cryptocurrency-related social media networks. Additionally, SHIB generated a lot of buzz on social media, garnering more than 85 million mentions. As a result of the social increase, SHIB briefly surged to a three-month high of $0.00001094. </p>
<p>Given the previous impact on the crypto asset&#8217;s price, there is speculation that a price uptick could be imminent. Investors and analysts will continue to closely monitor Shiba Inu&#8217;s performance as the cryptocurrency market develops and reacts to a range of external factors.</p>
<h2>SHIB&#8217;s Interest Goes Beyond Social Media</h2>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/why-is-shiba-inu-price-down-today/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">SHIB</a>&#8216;s interest has grown beyond the social media landspace over time. Recently, it became the second most sought-after digital asset in the European Union, solidifying its position in the market. </p>

<p>Shiba Inu secured the second position by surpassing well-known coins like Dogecoin (DOGE), Cardano (ADA), and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-holds-support-at-3250-as-etf-calculated-delay-may-mean-bigger-success/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ethereum (ETH)</a>. The rankings were established after thoroughly examining Google Trends data over the previous year to identify the cryptocurrency each European country wants to invest in based on searches.</p>
<p>This significant milestone suggests widespread recognition among European investors who are thinking about embracing the token. It also exhibits a steady surge in interest, which reflects the confidence of its global community.</p>

<title>JP Morgan Unveils Reason Ethereum May Not Be A Security</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/jp-morgan-reason-ethereum-not-security/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/jp-morgan-reason-ethereum-not-security/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。JP摩根的全球市场策略团队揭示了以太坊网络的关键发展，这可能会影响其在证券法下的分类。报告指出，以太坊网络中LIIDO的占比持续下降，这有助于缓解对以太坊集中化的担忧。以太坊社区对降低LIIDO的占比反应积极，认为这是向更加去中心化和健康的以太坊质押生态系统迈进的一步。此外，以太坊的技术升级和预期的Petra升级也被认为对以太坊的可扩展性和效率有益。<br /> <div>
<p>In a recent analysis, JP Morgan’s Global Markets Strategy team has shed light on key developments within the Ethereum network that could significantly influence its classification under securities law. The <a href="https://twitter.com/zerohedge/status/1776080929057841224" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">report</a> comes at a critical juncture for ETH, as the Swiss-based foundation is <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-in-the-hot-seat-sec-security-label-looms/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">under investigation</a> by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>
<h2>Why Ethereum Is Not A Security</h2>
<p>JP Morgan highlights the continued decrease in Lido&#8217;s share of staked ETH, which has fallen from about one-third a year ago to roughly a quarter currently. This shift towards a more decentralized staking ecosystem could alleviate regulatory concerns regarding centralization within the Ethereum network.</p>
<p>“Positive for the ethereum network, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-foundation-insider-lido-system-threat/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">share of Lido</a> in staked ETH has decreased further from around one third a year ago to around a quarter at the moment. This should reduce concerns about concentration in the Ethereum network, thus raising the chance that Ethereum will avoid being designated as security in the future,” the report states.</p>

<p>The analysts also reference the so-called &#8220;Hinman documents,&#8221; released last June, which have played a pivotal role in shaping the SEC’s stance on digital tokens. According to these documents, the degree of network decentralization is crucial, as tokens on a sufficiently decentralized network may not be classified as securities.</p>
<p>It read:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>In particular SEC officials had acknowledged in the past that tokens on a sufficiently decentralized network are no longer securities because there is no “controlling group” in the Howey test.</strong></p></blockquote>
Community Perspectives On Decentralization
<p>The Ethereum community has reacted positively to these developments. Anthony Sassano, founder of The Daily Gwei and co-founder of EthHub, <a href="https://twitter.com/sassal0x/status/1775703292884156829" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">commented</a> on the decreasing dominance of Lido, attributing it to increased competition in the staking space. This, according to Sassano, is a step towards a more decentralized and healthy ETH staking ecosystem.</p>
<p>“I&#8217;ve been saying for a long time that the best way to stop Lido from growing and reducing its market share is to increase competition in the staking space which we have now done! The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-staking-momentum-falling-whats-going-on/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ethereum staking</a> ecosystem has never been healthier,” Sassano remarked.</p>

<p>However, opinions on the current crop of restaking projects remain mixed, with some users questioning if restaking projects “are better.” In response, Sassano argued, &#8220;The debate is only able to be had once we have a vibrant free market of Ethereum staking projects &#8211; not a handful that dominate most of the market share.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seraphim, head of growth at Ethena Labs, <a href="https://twitter.com/MacroMate8/status/1775786110448230627" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">offered</a> a pragmatic take on the situation, suggesting that offering better yields is a more effective strategy than criticism, stating: “Turns out providing more yield is better business strategy than whining like Rocketpool trolls Happy for LRT projects even tho I am Lido-biased. This accelerates the space into something new and exciting.”</p>
More Positives For Ethereum
<p>JP Morgan also highlighted the significance of the Dencun upgrade in their report, which is a major technological advancement since the previous Shanghai upgrade. By introducing blobs and cryptographic schemes such as the KZG commitment scheme, the Dencun upgrade has &#8220;significantly reduced the transaction costs on Ethereum layer 2,&#8221; according to the report.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the anticipated Petra upgrade is expected to introduce Verkle trees, facilitating efficient data storage and further bolstering Ethereum&#8217;s scalability and efficiency. The report optimistically notes, &#8220;Petra&#8230; would introduce features like Verkle trees for efficient data storage which aim at simplifying block verification by pruning historical blocks older than one year, thus conserving storage and bandwidth.&#8221;</p>
<p>At press time, ETH traded at $3,275.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章介绍了不丹在比特币挖掘领域的大胆尝试。面对新冠疫情对旅游业的打击，不丹将比特币挖掘视为潜在的收入来源，与Bitdeer Technologies Group合作进行扩大规模。然而，可能面临的挑战包括对环境的影响和比特币价格波动对挖矿回报的影响。文章强调了不丹的决定在加密货币挖掘领域的重要性，但也指出了长期可持续性和盈利性的不确定性。 <div>
<p>Nestled in the Himalayas, Bhutan, known for its focus on Gross National Happiness, is making a bold wager in the world of cryptocurrency. The country is rapidly <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-04/bhutan-to-upgrade-bitcoin-btc-mining-in-himalayas-as-halving-looms?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=bd&amp;cmpId=google" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">expanding its Bitcoin mining capabilities</a> in anticipation of the upcoming halving, an event programmed into Bitcoin&#8217;s code that cuts the number of new coins awarded to miners in half.</p>
<p>This strategic move comes after Bhutan&#8217;s economy, heavily reliant on tourism, was hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. With foreign exchange reserves dwindling and unemployment rising, the government is looking to Bitcoin mining as a potential source of revenue.</p>

<p><a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Bhutan-puts-Bitcoin-mining-plan-in-motion-to-power-up-economy" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Bhutan&#8217;s foray into cryptocurrency</a> mining began in 2023. Now, the kingdom is partnering with Bitdeer Technologies Group, a Nasdaq-listed company, to significantly boost its mining capacity. By 2025, this collaboration aims to triple Bhutan&#8217;s current capabilities, bringing its total mining power to a staggering 600 megawatts – a 500-megawatt increase.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Halving Spurs Mining Expansion</h2>
<p>The driving force behind this expansion is the upcoming <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-analyst-sees-100k-before-halving/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin halving</a>, expected in April 2024. This quadrennial event directly impacts miners&#8217; profitability. By reducing the number of new Bitcoins awarded per block mined, the halving essentially cuts miners&#8217; potential income in half. Bhutan&#8217;s strategy is to counteract this decrease by significantly increasing its mining volume.</p>
<p>This approach mirrors a global trend. Data from Coin Metrics reveals a staggering 60% surge in global Bitcoin mining energy consumption this year, possibly reflecting miners worldwide seeking to hedge against the halving&#8217;s impact.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZFqHtfxn/" width="2475" /></p>

<h2>Challenges For Bhutan&#8217;s Bitcoin Gamble</h2>
<p>However, Bhutan&#8217;s path isn&#8217;t without challenges. While the country boasts a clean energy advantage, relying heavily on hydropower for mining, the environmental implications of such a large-scale operation remain to be thoroughly evaluated. Experts caution that the energy demands of this endeavor could strain Bhutan&#8217;s hydropower capacity, potentially impacting the supply available to the population.</p>




<p>Additionally, the success of Bhutan&#8217;s gamble hinges heavily on the price of Bitcoin. If the price fails to rise significantly after the halving to compensate for the reduced rewards, miners, including those in Bhutan, could face financial difficulties. The cryptocurrency market is notoriously volatile, and a price slump could significantly impact Bhutan&#8217;s return on investment.</p>

<p>Bhutan&#8217;s decision to enter the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">crypto</a> mining arena marks a significant shift for the nation. While the potential economic benefits are undeniable, the long-term sustainability and profitability of this venture remain to be seen.</p>
<p>The coming months will be crucial as the world observes how this unique experiment in the lofty heights of the Himalayas unfolds. Bhutan&#8217;s gamble could pave the way for other developing nations to explore cryptocurrency mining as a revenue stream, but questions regarding environmental impact and market dependence will need to be addressed for this strategy to be truly sustainable.</p>

<title>Solana Faces ‘Existential Moment’: Co-Founder Speaks Out</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/solana-existential-moment-co-founder-speaks-out/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/solana-existential-moment-co-founder-speaks-out/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。Solana网络遭遇前所未有的拥堵，导致交易失败率创纪录。75%的非投票交易失败是由“bot spam”引起的，而不是真实用户交易。该问题被认为是Solana的“存在时刻”，需要解决拥堵问题和抑制垃圾信息。Solana社区和开发者展现出积极的态度，努力改善网络基础设施，确保网络在面对前所未有的挑战时的成功。 <div>
<p>The Solana network has been experiencing unprecedented levels of congestion, leading to a record failure rate of transactions. According to data from Dune Analytics, on April 4, more than three-quarters of all &#8220;non-vote&#8221; transactions on Solana failed.</p>
<p>This surge in failed transactions coincides with a significant increase in network activity, driven largely by the recent craze over memecoins on the platform, which saw Solana&#8217;s transaction volume and unique user count skyrocket.</p>
<p>The issue has sparked considerable debate within the Solana community, with users voicing their frustrations over failed transactions and a deteriorating user experience on social media platforms.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The Solana network currently has a non-vote transaction failure rate of 76.8%, according to <a href="https://twitter.com/scarn_eth?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">@scarn_eth</a> Dune data.

<p></p>
<p>In the midst of this crisis, Mert Mumtaz, CEO of Helius and a vocal supporter of Solana, took to X to <a href="https://twitter.com/0xMert_/status/1771700602629730795" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">address</a> the growing concerns. Mumtaz argued that the reported 75% transaction failure rate is a misrepresentation of the network&#8217;s health, stating that the vast majority of these failures are attributable to &#8220;bot spam&#8221; rather than genuine user transactions being thwarted.</p>

<p>He provided a detailed explanation, drawing parallels to web2 operations to elucidate the nature of these &#8220;failed&#8221; transactions. According to Mumtaz, many of the failed transactions are instances where the smart contract on the blockchain deems a request invalid due to various reasons, such as lack of permissions or changes in market conditions, rather than issues with the blockchain itself.</p>
<p>Mumtaz&#8217;s explanation aimed to clarify the distinction between different types of transaction failures, emphasizing that the primary concern is with transactions that do not reach the blockchain due to capacity constraints on block leaders. He contended that the real issue is not with Solana&#8217;s throughput but with the excessive volume of spam transactions.</p>
<p>&#8220;The chart [referring to failed transactions] importantly doesn&#8217;t accurately capture the user experience since the overwhelming number of issues are before the txns even make it to the block,&#8221; Mumtaz explained. He reassured the community that measures are being taken to address these challenges, including improvements in transaction handling and introducing better incentives to deter spam activities.</p>
<h2>An &#8220;Existential Moment&#8221; For Solana</h2>
<p>Echoing the sentiment of urgency and concern, Ryan Rzepecki, founder of Spectra Cities, remarked on the situation as being an &#8220;existential moment&#8221; for Solana, likening its severity to the repercussions of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-collapse-alameda-usdt/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">FTX collapse</a>. Rzepecki <a href="https://twitter.com/ryrzny/status/1775937228885139700" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">remarked</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>The entire Solana thesis comes down to whether different applications can share the same chain and if composability is more important than sovereignty. For this to work, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/memecoin-mania-data-massive-influx-traders-dogecoin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">memecoin trading</a> can’t disrupt payments, governance, depin, and all the other activities. This is an existential moment as big as the FTX collapse.</strong></p></blockquote>

<p>Rzepecki concluded with a note of optimism, expressing confidence in the Solana community&#8217;s ability to resolve these issues, despite acknowledging the growing discontent among users and ecosystem partners. “To be clear, I am very confident these are solvable problems. But Solana is losing the confidence of users and major ecosystem partners every day things operate like this.”</p>
<p>Solana&#8217;s co-founder, Anatoly Yakovenko responded to this, providing a nuanced perspective on the challenges at hand. &#8220;The fun part is that every <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/can-solana-exist-without-layer-2s/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">scaling challenge</a> is an existential one,&#8221; Yakovenko remarked, acknowledging the gravity of the situation.</p>
<p>He further <a href="https://twitter.com/aeyakovenko/status/1776068458742223143" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">elaborated</a> on the complexities of addressing congestion issues, contrasting them with total system failures. &#8220;Dealing with congestion bugs sucks so much more than total liveness failure. The latter is one and done, bug is identified and patched and chain continues. The former has to go through the full release and test pipeline. Shipping fast is impossible.”</p>
<p>The response by Yakovenko and the Solana developer community reflects a blend of realism and optimism. The community&#8217;s resolve to address the underlying issues and improve the network&#8217;s infrastructure is palpable, underscoring a collective effort to ensure Solana&#8217;s longevity and success in the face of unprecedented challenges.</p>
<p>At press time, SOL traded at $175.86.</p>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。2024年被证明是普通投资者赚钱的一年，CoinLedger的数据显示，加密投资组合增长明显，未实现的加密收益反映了市场的弹性。比特币和以太坊是投资者持有最多的加密货币，同时也取得了最大的增长。从CryptoQuant的数据中可以看出，比特币交易所储备已经降至自2021年初以来创下的最低水平。最近一个月中超过90,700个比特币已经从主要交易所中提取。这种趋势表明投资者正在向长期资产持有策略过渡。 <div>
<p>2024 has proven to be a lucrative year for the average investor, according to recent <a href="https://coinledger.io/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">data</a> unveiled by CoinLedger. The platform&#8217;s data reveals a notable surge in the average crypto portfolio, with gains totaling $2,804 thus far.</p>
<p>This notable increase starkly contrasts with the modest average realized gains of<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-market-resurgence-new-data-shows-average/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> less than $1,000 observed throughout 2023</a>.</p>

<h2>Unrealized Crypto Gains Reflect Market Resilience</h2>
<p>Despite enduring losses exceeding $7,000 on average during 2022, according to Coinledger, investors witnessed a notable resurgence in 2024. The growth in unrealized gains underscores the resilience of the crypto market.</p>
<p>Against these notable developments, CoinLedger CEO David Kemmerer expressed optimism regarding the industry&#8217;s trajectory. He emphasized the &#8220;thriving&#8221; nature of the crypto market, attributing the resurgence to the renewed prominence of cryptocurrencies like <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-monthly-volume-surpasses-yearly-why-bullish/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin</a> and Ethereum.</p>
<p>CoinLedger&#8217;s insights are drawn from its extensive user base, comprising over 500,000 crypto investors globally. Most users hail from the United States, supplemented by contributions from Australia, Canada, and various other nations. CoinLedger&#8217;s data provides a snapshot of the market&#8217;s performance.</p>
<img alt="Bitcoin (BTC) price chart on TradingView amid crypto news" height="1496" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/Ea841QeJ/" width="2770" />
<h2>Key Trends And Observations</h2>
<p>Examining the top performers within CoinLedger&#8217;s user base reveals Bitcoin and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-average-fees-has-hit-a-new-2023-low-data/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ethereum</a> as the standout assets, registering the most substantial gains in raw US dollar value, while Solana (SOL), Cardano (ADA), and Polygon (MATIC) round out the top five.</p>
<p>For context, Bitcoin and Ethereum have surged roughly over 50% since the year started. SOL, ADA, and MATIC, on the other end, have only seen roughly over 30% so far this year</p>
<p>Interestingly, despite regulatory challenges and legal scrutiny faced by Binance&#8217;s BNB coin, it remains a significant player, securing the sixth position in gains.</p>
<p>Furthermore, insights into investor behavior reveal Bitcoin&#8217;s enduring popularity as the most-held crypto among CoinLedger users. This trend aligns with the latest <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/asset/btc/chart/exchange-flows/exchange-reserve?exchange=all_exchange&amp;window=DAY&amp;sma=0&amp;ema=0&amp;priceScale=log&amp;metricScale=linear&amp;chartStyle=line" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">findings</a> from CryptoQuant, indicating that Bitcoin exchange reserves have now plummeted to their lowest levels on record since early 2021.</p>
<img alt="Bitcoin exchange reserves plummet" class="size-medium wp-image-292058" height="370" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Screenshot-2024-04-04-at-18.49.25.png?w=640&#038;resize=640%2C370" width="640" />
<p>Data from CryptoQuant underscores this shift, revealing that over the past month, more than 90,700 bitcoins have been withdrawn from major <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-exchange-kucoin-sees-massive-outflows-after-doj-lawsuit-report/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">crypto exchanges</a>.</p>
<p>This notable trend signals a reduction in the available supply of Bitcoin on these platforms, suggesting a strategic move by investors toward long-term asset-holding strategies.</p>

<p>This pattern of behavior from investors towards Bitcoin outflows from exchanges to cold storage solutions is likely influenced by various factors, including the steady ascent in the digital asset&#8217;s valuation and significant events such as the anticipation surrounding the forthcoming Bitcoin halving event and the approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the US.</p>

<title>Community Outcry: SushiSwap Team Accused Of Plotting To Kill DAO And Seize Treasury</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/sushiswap-team-accused-of-plotting-to-kill-dao/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/sushiswap-team-accused-of-plotting-to-kill-dao/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的<br />文章讨论了SushiSwap面临的争议，其中提出了关于改变治理结构的提议引发了社区成员和前员工的反对意见。提议将资产转移至名为“Sushi Labs”的新实体，并将未来的空投重定向到新实体而非DAO。前成员指责公司实施实质性的“敌意接管”，表示对当前的治理结构不满，并强调了社区参与的重要性。当前有93%的参与者投票反对争议性治理提议。 <div>
<p>The decentralized exchange (DEX) and automated market maker (AMM) protocol <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sushiswap-forks-uniswap-v3-and-deploys-on-13-networks-will-more-dexes-follow/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">SushiSwap</a> has been at the center of a significant controversy as users and a former associate express their opposition to proposed governance changes. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://mirror.xyz/%F0%9F%8D%A3%F0%9F%91%A8%E2%80%8D%F0%9F%8D%B3.eth/7lW1niphhpmwURtR2Q7vI6955UhO1Bdv7R2EnwOqDbA" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">controversial proposal</a> aims to transfer assets from the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)-controlled treasury to a new entity called &#8220;Sushi Labs,&#8221; while redirecting all future airdrops to the new body instead of the DAO. These developments have raised concerns about community involvement and transparency within SushiSwap.</p>
<h2>SushiSwap Faces Backlash Over Proposed Changes</h2>
<p>The proposed governance changes put forward by the exchange request a grant of 25 million Sushi tokens to be awarded to Sushi Labs, including assets from various sources such as the Arbitrum (ARB) airdrop, business development, partner grants, Kanpai 2.0, Sushi 2.0, rewards, stablecoins, and &#8220;Sushi House&#8221; funds. </p>
<p>Sushi Labs would become the sole beneficiary of future airdrops awarded to Sushi by protocols and partners. However, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shibburn-shiba-inu-ecosystem-rigged/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">discrepancies </a>have been noted regarding the wallet holdings mentioned in the proposal, which has led to further scrutiny.</p>

<p>The Sushi DAO had previously approved a ballot window to establish a baseline legal entity structure. However, as the project&#8217;s needs evolve, the proposal&#8217;s proponents argue that updating the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/memecoin-mania-data-massive-influx-traders-dogecoin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">organizational structure</a> is critical. </p>
<p>They emphasize the importance of competent legal guidance to represent Sushi&#8217;s global presence effectively. The proposal also aims to empower Sushi Labs with full operational responsibility for core product development, seeking to streamline decision-making processes.</p>
<p>Faced with these developments, Naïm Boubziz, a former member of SushiSwap, has accused the company of carrying out a real “hostile takeover.” </p>
<h2>Decentralized Governance Under Scrutiny</h2>
<p>In a series of damning social media <a href="https://x.com/BrutalTrade/status/1775591081620439221?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">posts</a>, Naïm Boubziz has unleashed scathing criticism against SushiSwap&#8217;s head chef, Jared Grey. Boubziz accuses Jared of plotting to &#8220;kill the community&#8221; and the DAO while aiming to seize 100% of the treasury. Expressing disappointment, Boubziz claims to have issued warnings for months, but his concerns were ignored under “false pretenses.”</p>
<p>Boubziz further alleges that snapshots were deleted without a proper reaction and accuses the community of turning a blind eye to the truth. Highlighting the claim of a &#8220;hostile takeover&#8221; previously made by Jared, Boubziz asserts that their actions were meant to prevent the very scenario that is currently unfolding. </p>
<p>Boubziz also argues that the current governance structure employed by SushiSwap <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-will-btc-prices-follow-rampant-gold/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">requires updates</a> and stresses the importance of community involvement. However, Boubziz further noted: </p>
<blockquote><p>… deep down you know exactly what is happening and what happened. The facts speak for themselves. It&#8217;s over for Sushiswap.</p></blockquote>
<p>These explosive accusations place SushiSwap at a critical crossroads as the governance proposal controversy deepens. The rift between those advocating for community involvement and supporters of the proposed changes has intensified, raising concerns about the project&#8217;s future. </p>

<p>So far, about 93% of participants have voted &#8220;no&#8221; in the ongoing signal vote on a controversial governance proposal for SushiSwap. Despite the overwhelming <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/why-is-shiba-inu-price-down-today/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">opposition</a>, a second vote is scheduled for April 9th to determine whether the proposal will be implemented.</p>
<img alt="SushiSwap" class="size-large" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/MEm9abc1/" width="1815" />
<p>The exchange&#8217;s native token, SUSHI, is presently trading at $1.59, reflecting a continued downtrend over the past month with a decline of 12%.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Bullish Signal: “Accumulation Addresses” Continue Buying Big</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bullish-accumulation-addresses-buying-big/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bullish-accumulation-addresses-buying-big/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。本文报道了比特币在链数据显示，所谓的“积累地址”本月一直在大量购买加密货币。这些积累地址是持有者持有加密货币的用户，他们最近观察到资金流入。自年初以来，比特币流入积累地址的趋势一直很高，这表明这些投资者最近一直在购买。这些投资者的购买对加密货币市场产生积极影响，比特币价格也已经回升超过68100美元。 <div>
<p>Bitcoin on-chain data shows the so-called &#8220;accumulation addresses&#8221; have been buying large amounts of the cryptocurrency this month.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Accumulation Addresses Have Seen Large Inflows Recently</h2>
<p>As analyst Ali pointed out in a new <a href="https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1775797142000427338" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Bitcoin accumulation addresses have been observing inflows recently. The &#8220;accumulation addresses&#8221; here refer to the wallets of the cryptocurrency&#8217;s perennial HODLers.</p>
<p>Certain conditions must be satisfied for an address to be included in this cohort. Perhaps the most characteristic is that the wallet must not record outgoing transfers.</p>



<p>This means that accumulation addresses are those who have only bought tokens (that is, received only incoming transfers) and never participated in any <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/spot-bitcoin-etf-noobs-panic-selling/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">selling</a>.</p>
<p>Addresses are also only considered to be part of this group once they have received at least two inflow transactions and hold greater than 10 BTC in their balance.</p>
<p>Exchange and miner-associated wallets are excluded from this class of investors, as the supply held by these entities represents the sell-side of the market (as investors deposit to exchanges for selling, while miners themselves are a constant source of selling pressure in the market).</p>
<p>The supply held by the accumulation addresses is considered to be locked tightly in the hands of these HODLers, so the available supply effectively goes down when these investors buy more.</p>
<p>Wallets that last received an inflow more than seven years ago are also excluded from this group since addresses so inactive are generally considered lost due to being forgotten or having their keys misplaced. Such wallets would naturally not count as &#8220;HODLers,&#8221; at least not voluntary ones.</p>
<p>Now, here is the CryptoQuant chart shared by Ali that shows the trend in the Bitcoin inflows going towards these accumulation addresses since the start of the year:</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Inflows To Accumulation Addresses" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="2580" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GKTlylCWYAA8Zmx?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096" width="4096" /></p>

<p>As the above graph shows, the Bitcoin inflows to accumulation addresses have been high this month, suggesting that these investors have been continuously buying recently.</p>
<p>On the first date of the month, the metric even hit a value of 21,400 BTC. At the current exchange rate of the cryptocurrency, this stack is worth more than $1.4 billion.</p>

<p>This is a significant amount and is not too far from the 25,300 BTC all-time high (ATH) that the indicator achieved just a month and a half ago.</p>
<p>Naturally, this latest buying from these investors would be a positive sign for the cryptocurrency. As if responding to it, BTC appears to have found its footing again, as it has made some recovery over the past day.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>Following the jump of over 3% today, Bitcoin has recovered above the $68,100 level.</p>

<title>Ripple To Emerge As Tether Rival With Upcoming USD-Pegged Stablecoin Launch</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-emerge-tether-upcoming-stablecoin-launch/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-emerge-tether-upcoming-stablecoin-launch/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。Payment company Ripple宣布推出美元挂钩数字货币，进军稳定币市场，以与Tether和Circle竞争。市场变化促使Ripple推出稳定币，以解决竞争对手的稳定性问题。Ripple计划的稳定币将1比1地以美元储备支持，定期提供资产负债报告。尽管面临激烈竞争，Ripple表示信心，并打算通过稳定币和跨境交易产品区分自己。此举符合其全球跨境支付愿景，但仍面临推广难题。 <div>
<p>Payment company firm Ripple has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/04/crypto-firm-ripple-to-launch-us-dollar-stablecoin.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> its foray into the stablecoin market with an imminent launch of its own US dollar-pegged digital currency. This development positions Ripple to compete directly with established stablecoin giants like Tether and Circle, which dominate the $150 billion market.</p>
<p>Ripple&#8217;s entry into the stablecoin arena signifies a strategic expansion of its offerings, aiming to tap into the growing demand for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-clo-counters-gurbir-grewal-criticisms/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">stable digital assets</a>.</p>

<h2>Ripple Stablecoin Market Entry Strategy</h2>
<p>Ripple&#8217;s decision to introduce its stablecoin comes amid a shifting landscape in the market, marked by recent volatility and concerns about the stability of existing offerings.</p>
<p>According to the blockchain firm CEO Brad Garlinghouse, the company opted to launch a stablecoin in the market during the previous year, prompted by the &#8220;depegging&#8221; incidents experienced by competitors such as Tether&#8217;s USDT token and Circle&#8217;s USDC.</p>
<p>Particularly In 2022, USDT faced a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/here-are-facts-on-chain-data-reveals-tethers-depeg/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">temporary loss of its $1 peg</a> due to market turbulence stemming from the collapse of terraUSD, a failed &#8220;algorithmic&#8221; stablecoin. Similarly, in 2023, USDC encountered a brief <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/usdc-circle-3-3b-stuck-at-svb/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">drop below $1</a> following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, a tech-oriented lending institution.</p>
<p>Notably, the new stablecoin Ripple is set to launch and is said to be backed 1-to-1 by a reserve of assets, including US dollar deposits, government bonds, and cash equivalents.</p>
<p>In an interview with CNBC, the blockchain firm emphasized its &#8220;<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bigger-argument-in-ripple-vs-us-sec-case/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">dedication to transparency</a>&#8221; by committing to provide monthly &#8220;attestation reports&#8221; on its reserves.</p>
<h2>Navigating Competitive Terrain</h2>
<p>While Ripple is about to face stiff competition from established players like Tether and Circle, the company remains determined. Brad Garlinghouse expressed confidence in <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-2-major-technical-advances-xrp-ledger/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">the company&#8217;s ability</a> to carve out a niche in the stablecoin market, citing the company&#8217;s regulatory compliance and global licensing. Garlinghouse stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>This market will look different, certainly based on size</p></blockquote>
<p>According to the report, Ripple aims to leverage its<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-ruling-judge-torres-could-be-thrown-out/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> regulatory credentials</a> to distinguish itself from competitors, positioning its stablecoin as a &#8220;reliable and compliant alternative.&#8221;</p>
<p>The company&#8217;s stablecoin initiative also aligns with its broader vision of facilitating cross-border transactions through its &#8220;On-Demand Liquidity product,&#8221; which utilizes the &#8220;XRP token as a bridge currency.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is worth noting that despite its ambitious plans, Ripple faces challenges in gaining widespread adoption. Particularly, the company has <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-clo-coinbase-vs-sec-is-far-from-over/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">encountered obstacles</a> in promoting XRP for cross-border payments, with some partners opting out due to concerns about market readiness and cost implications.</p>



<p>However, Ripple remains optimistic about the prospects for its imminent stablecoin, citing growing demand from the XRP community and the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem.</p>

<title>Binance Executive’s Tax Evasion Case In Nigeria Postponed, Hearing Set For April 19</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/binance-executive-case-in-nigeria-postponed/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/binance-executive-case-in-nigeria-postponed/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是负面的。<br />一名币安高管因涉嫌逃税罪名被扣留在尼日利亚，并于裁决日延期至4月19日。该高管被指控未缴纳增值税和企业所得税，以及帮助客户透过币安平台逃税。在法庭上，审判官决定因高管首次了解指控而延期审理。币安发表声明表示该高管没有决策权，并呼吁不应追究其责任。币安的交易平台币BNB显示了一定的上涨趋势。 <div>
<p>In a recent development, a Binance executive detained in Nigeria on tax evasion charges has had his case adjourned until April 19, following his first appearance in court. </p>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-executive-sues-nigerian-government/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Tigran Gambaryan</a>, the head of financial crime compliance at Binance, was accused alongside the company of various charges, including non-payment of value-added tax and corporate income tax and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/nigeria-detains-binances-crypto-crime-investigator/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">alleged complicity</a> in aiding customers to evade taxes through the Binance platform. </p>
<h2>Delay In Binance Executive&#8217;s Case</h2>
<p>According to a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-04/binance-executive-s-nigerian-court-case-adjourned-until-april-19" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, during the proceedings, Justice Emeka Nwite decided to adjourn Gambaryan&#8217;s case for a longer period after learning that he was seeing the charges for the first time on Thursday. </p>
<p>The prosecution explained that they could not serve the charges earlier, alleging that Gambaryan was in the custody of a different federal agency, the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). The charges were finally served in court.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, another Binance executive, Nadeem Anjarwalla, who held UK and Kenyan citizenship,<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-houdini-binance-exec-escapes-from-nigerian-custody-amid-tax-evasion-charges-report/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> fled Nigeria last month</a> after being seized alongside Gambaryan. </p>
<p>The two executives had traveled to Nigeria in late February at the authorities&#8217; invitation to meet with officials after the government restricted access to cryptocurrency channels as part of a broader effort to combat currency speculation. </p>
<h2>High-Stakes Court Hearing</h2>
<p>The popularity of cryptocurrencies among Nigerians has surged due to the devaluation of the naira, prompting the government to crack down on platforms offering <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-suspends-all-operations-in-nigeria/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">digital tokens</a>. </p>
<p>In February, Central Bank Governor Olayemi Cardoso <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/nigeria-fines-binance-10-billion/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">alleged </a>that Binance had facilitated $26 billion in untraceable transactions shortly before the arrest of the two Binance executives. </p>
<p>In response to the case, Binance <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-denies-decision-making-detained-executive/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">stated</a><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-denies-decision-making-detained-executive/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> </a>on Wednesday, before the hearing, that Gambaryan had no decision-making power within the company and urged that he not be held accountable. At the same time, discussions between Binance and Nigerian government officials were ongoing.</p>
<p>During the court hearing, arguments revolved around whether Binance could be served charges through its employee, Gambaryan. Mark Mordi, Gambaryan&#8217;s counsel, argued that due process had not been followed and highlighted his client&#8217;s explicit statement that he was not authorized to receive charges on behalf of the company.</p>
<p>Gambaryan&#8217;s legal defense further claimed, &#8220;The world is looking at us, let&#8217;s not treat this matter as a trivial matter.” </p>

<p>As the case unfolds, it reminds us of the increased scrutiny that cryptocurrency exchanges have faced in recent months, highlighting the need for clear <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-establishes-first-ever-board-of-directors/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">regulatory frameworks</a> and adherence to due process to address concerns related to allegations of tax evasion and financial crimes.</p>
<p>For now, Gambaryan remains in the custody of Nigeria&#8217;s Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, awaiting further developments in the case and its outcome, as imprisonment could be one possible outcome. </p>
<img alt="Binance " class="size-large" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/bXygueM2/" width="1815" />
<p>As of this writing, the exchange&#8217;s native token, BNB, is currently trading at $593, showing a notable uptrend of 6.5% in the last 24 hours. </p>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。摩根士丹利和瑞士银行UBS已经加入了一个竞争，以其平台上添加加密货币产品。根据消息来源，摩根士丹利将于两周内批准比特币ETF。同时，UBS也计划在下周将BTC ETF纳入其平台。摩根士丹利希望成为第一家提供BTC ETF的经纪公司，并且UBS的动作似乎已经将全球银行业的态度转变成一场竞赛。摩根士丹利可能会在UBS之前宣布在其平台上添加比特币ETF。报道称，银行平台正在等待其中一个先行行动，因为这将给其他银行提供“掩护”。 <div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Institutional interest and adoption significantly increased after Spot Bitcoin ETFs (exchange-traded funds) were approved in the US. As a result, Morgan Stanley and UBS have entered a race to add crypto products to their platforms.</p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Morgan Stanley Meets Competition</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/morgan-stanley-bitcoin-etfs-2-weeks-insider/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">reported</a> by Bitcoinist, the news was broken by crypto commentator Andrew from Arch Public on March 26. The information revealed that the financial giant Morgan Stanley approved Bitcoin ETFs on its platforms.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Several sources inside the banking titan confirmed that the approval would come in two weeks. Moreover, the crypto commentator affirmed that his sources included insiders from Bitcoin ETF firms and legal individuals adjacent to both.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A Tuesday <a href="https://twitter.com/AP_Abacus/status/1775164475730968813" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">update</a> on the situation revealed that another financial titan, the multinational investment bank UBS, joined the race to offer spot Bitcoin ETFs. The news was first shared on Scott Melker’s show.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">According to the X post, UBS was set to include BTC ETFs on its platform next week, when the US bank will supposedly add them, to be “widely available.”</p>

<p>&mdash; Andrew (@AP_Abacus) <a href="https://twitter.com/AP_Abacus/status/1775527946343653779?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">April 3, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Sources told the crypto commentator that Morgan Staley executives are not pleased with UBS’s move. The executives are allegedly “salty” about the news as they want to be “the first wirehouse to approve the Bitcoin ETFs fully.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Morgan Stanley’s hopes to become the first brokerage house to offer BTC ETFs are not surprising. The US financial institution holds over $1.5 trillion in clients’ assets and has <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/morgan-stanley-deepens-crypto-exposure-through-grayscale-bitcoin-trust/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">embraced</a> the flagship cryptocurrency for years.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In 2021, Morgan Stanley became the first major US bank to offer BTC exposure to its clients. The success of the Bitcoin ETFs has attracted different traditional financial institutions to these products, including big players like banks and digital asset firms worldwide.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Spot Bitcoin ETF’s New Race</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">UBS’s move has seemingly turned the global banking industry’s view of approval into a race. As Andrew commented on Wednesday on X, “interesting that global banks are talking about $BTC ETFs as a race.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">According to the post, Morgan Stanley could make another effort to end on top of its competition. Sources told Andrew that the US bank could announce Bitcoin ETFs on its platform before UBS.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Bloomberg ETF expert Eric Balchunas <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1775538520515359225" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">weighed</a> in. “Solid sources” informed Balchunas that neither bank has added the BTC ETFs to their platforms. Seemingly, the products are “still in holding pattern.”</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Correct. Unsolicited is already in effect</p>
<p>&mdash; Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1775540747258990884?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">April 3, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Andrew added that UBS’s BTC ETFs are technically already on the platform. According to the commentator, they “already approved in PWM (&gt;$10MM)” but must be marked as “unsolicited.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the ETF expert commented on the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-spot-etf-race-grayscale/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">race approach</a> of the financial institutions. He suggested that “in a compliance game of chicken,” baking platforms are waiting for one of them to go first as it would give the others “cover.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Balchunas considers it will probably be an all-at-once type of movement, although “when” remains uncertain.</p>

<title>Shiba Inu Beats Out Bitcoin, Dogecoin As Major Exchange Reveals Most Traded Crypto</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-bitcoin-dogecoin/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-bitcoin-dogecoin/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。在印度最大的加密货币交易所WazirX发布的报告中，Shiba Inu在三月份成为了最受交易欢迎的加密货币，超越了比特币和狗狗币。报告显示，追随者数量不断增长的Shiba Inu已经在多个交易所上市，并且继续得到广泛认可。除了印度市场外，Shiba Inu还在澳大利亚的Bitcoin.com上线。这显示了投资者越来越倾向于投资于梗币，而不是具有实用性的项目。这种持续的采纳对Shiba Inu来说是一个好消息，因为它带来了更多的交易量和交易所上市。<br /> <div>
<p class="p2"><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-whale-transactions-2/">Shiba Inu continues to defy expectations</a> years after it first launch with its continuously growing community. The interest in the dog-themed coin has caused its trading volume to rise across exchanges, and in some cases, becoming the top traded coin. This is the case of Indian crypto exchange WazirX, which just released its report for the most traded cryptocurrencies on the platform.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Shiba Inu Comes Out Ahead Of Bitcoin And Dogecoin</h2>
<p class="p2">The Indian crypto which is the largest in the country took to X (formerly Twitter) to share the results of the most traded cryptocurrencies on the platform for the month of March 2024. While there were the regulars on the list like <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-eyes-the-gold-throne-market-guru-says/">Bitcoin</a>, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-flip-dogecoin-shib/">Shiba Inu outperformed every single one</a>.</p>

<p class="p2">Shiba Inu emerged as the most traded coin on the WazirX crypto exchange, followed by <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-eyes-the-gold-throne-market-guru-says/">Bitcoin</a> in second place. However, unlike usual reports that would see <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-insider-earth-shattering-reveal-tomorrow/">Ethereum</a> feature heavily in reports like this, it was nowhere to be found as it did not even make the top 5 most traded coins.</p>
<p class="p2">Instead, meme coins dominated the list, leaving Bitcoin as the odd man out. In third place was <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-pepe-whales-sold/">Pepe (PEPE),</a> which had garnered a lot of support after rising 500% in a month. Then next was <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/floki-12m-users-using-the-memecoin-via-binance-pay/">Floki (FLOKI)</a>, another meme coin that did incredibly well in the month of March. Last but not least was <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-doge-price-can-reach-1/">Dogecoin</a> in fifth place, proving that despite all of the competition from the shiny new meme coins, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-doge-price-can-reach-1/">Dogecoin</a> has been able to stand its ground as the largest meme coin in the market.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p></p>
<p class="p2">The report shed light on how crypto investors, especially in India, are viewing the market right now. With meme coins dominating the majority of volumes, it suggests that investors are looking to these coins for more gains compared to established projects with utility, such as <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-insider-earth-shattering-reveal-tomorrow/">Ethereum</a>.</p>
<h2 class="p2">SHIB Spreads Its Wings Far And Wide</h2>
<p class="p2">The continued adoption of Shiba Inu has seen <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-turns-bullish-crypto/">the meme coin</a> score even more exchange listings through the bear market and into the bull market. One of the most recent instances of Shiba Inu being listed on exchanges is Bitcoin.com.</p>

<p class="p2">On March 25, the Australian arm of the exchange <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-exchange-listing/">announced that it would be officially listing SHIB for trading</a> on the platform. This further spreads Shiba Inu to new investors in Australia, which is one of the fastest-growing cryptocurrency markets in the world.</p>
<p class="p2">Shiba Inu is currently listed on all major such as Binance, Coinbase, and Bitstamp. Most minor exchanges are not left out as listing <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-whale-transactions-2/">SHIB</a> can often be a good avenue for generating revenue for an exchange through fees. This is because of the high level of trading that happens with the meme coin and the higher the volume, the more money the exchanges make.</p>

<title>Coinbase Bolsters International Expansion Efforts With Restricted Dealer License In Canada</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/coinbase-dealer-license-in-canada/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/coinbase-dealer-license-in-canada/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章介绍了美国加密货币交易所Coinbase在加拿大获得注册许可的消息。Coinbase进军国际市场，尤其是因美国证券交易委员会对加密行业的打击。加拿大证券管理机构批准Coinbase在安大略省注册，使其能够操作并符合加拿大监管要求。文章还提到了竞争对手币安退出加拿大市场，并强调Coinbase对加拿大市场的乐观态度。Coinbase还在欧洲等地获得单独批准，展示了其在全球扩张的成功策略。 <div>
<p>US-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has obtained a registration license in Canada, signaling its intention to expand internationally amid<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/breaking-coinbase-sec-case-reaches-critical-point/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> increasing regulatory scrutiny</a> in the US market, led by the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s (SEC) ongoing crackdown on the industry. </p>
<p>The company announced that it has been registered as a restricted dealer in Ontario under the Canadian Securities Administrators (CSA) oversight, a collective body of provincial and territorial securities regulators in Canada. </p>
<p>This regulatory victory gives Coinbase the legal authority to conduct <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/usdc-coinbasehistory-repeat-bitcoin-rally/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">crypto asset transactions</a> while meeting the requirements set forth by Canadian regulators.</p>
<h2>Binance Out, Coinbase In </h2>
<p>According to a CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/04/coinbase-secures-restricted-dealer-license-in-canada.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, Canada implemented new guidelines for cryptocurrency exchanges last year, introducing limits on investments from certain investors and requiring crypto firms to register. </p>
<p>These policy changes prompted <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-establishes-first-ever-board-of-directors/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Binance</a>, the world&#8217;s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, to exit the Canadian market, citing an untenable operating environment. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, rival exchange <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/kraken-unveil-secret-europe-dutch-approval-unlocked/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Kraken </a>initiated the process of becoming a registered dealer in Canada by filing a pre-registration undertaking (PRU) with the Ontario Securities Commission.</p>

<p>According to the report, Coinbase filed its Pre-Registration Undertaking (PRU), a formal application made by the exchange to Canadian regulators, in March 2023 and officially launched its services in Canada in August of that year. </p>
<p>The company proudly claims to be Canada&#8217;s first international cryptocurrency exchange to receive restricted dealer registration. Lucas Matheson, Coinbase&#8217;s country director for Canada, emphasized the following: </p>
<blockquote><p>It’s something we’ve been working on for almost three years here in Canada, and more specifically with the Ontario Securities Commission over the last 12 months. We’ve been working diligently with our regulators over the past year on building a compliant platform in Canada to bring to Canadians</p></blockquote>
<p>Matheson highlighted Canada&#8217;s comparatively accommodating regulatory environment, especially in comparison to the challenging landscape faced by Coinbase and the broader crypto industry in the United States. </p>
<p>Notably, Canada launched the world&#8217;s first spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), the Purpose Bitcoin ETF, three years before the US. In addition, Matheson expressed optimism about the market opportunity in Canada, citing the country&#8217;s &#8220;highly educated&#8221; and &#8220;tech-savvy&#8221; population, which the Coinbase director said has a deep understanding of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-coinbase-futures-listing/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">digital economy</a>.</p>
<h2>Regulatory Success</h2>
<p>By registering in Canada, the exchange aims to enable Canadian customers to participate in the digital economy by leveraging its reputation, regulatory compliance, and prior regulatory approvals. </p>
<p>As part of its global expansion <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/paradigm-industry-titans-rallying-behind-coinbase/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">strategy</a>, Coinbase has established a technology hub in Canada and currently employs nearly 200 local professionals.</p>

<p>Coinbase&#8217;s license acquisition in Canada represents another success in its ongoing efforts to navigate regulatory landscapes worldwide. In pursuit of its &#8220;Go Broad, Go Deep&#8221; strategy announced in 2022, Coinbase has been actively pursuing local licenses in various international markets. </p>
<p>The company has received individual approvals in several European countries, including Ireland, France, Spain, Italy, and the Netherlands. Ireland serves as the primary regulatory base within the European Union.</p>
<p>Ultimately, as Coinbase continues to expand its global presence, Matheson believes that the company&#8217;s track record of working closely with regulators before launching its services positions it favorably. </p>
<img alt="Coinbase" class="size-large" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/irVLvFbN/" width="1815" />
<p>Coinbase&#8217;s stock, traded under the ticker name <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/coinbase-bond-bounces-back-on-bitcoin-rally/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">COIN</a>, is currently valued at $258, experiencing a notable surge of 6.8% following the news of its regulatory triumph in Canada.</p>

<title>Holy Satoshi! El Salvador Graduates Its 1st Batch Of Bitcoin Students</title>

<div> <b><br /><br />摘要：</b><br />这些信息是积极的。文章介绍了萨尔瓦多推出的比特币教育项目，首批学生成功毕业。该项目由非营利组织Mi Primer Bitcoin于2022年启动，得到了政府的支持。教育课程使用开源材料，如GitHub上的财务识字手册。虽然毕业典礼标志着重要的成就，但萨尔瓦多在比特币采用方面仍面临挑战，如商家接受比特币的低比例和城乡数字鸿沟的问题。这一实验的成功将取决于解决这些问题的能力。 <div>
<p>El Salvador&#8217;s world-first experiment in Bitcoin education reached a milestone on April 2nd, 2024, with the graduation of the first batch from the &#8220;Bitcoin Diploma&#8221; program.</p>

<p>Launched in 2022 by the non-profit Mi Primer Bitcoin, the program aims to equip Salvadorans with the knowledge and skills to navigate the world of Bitcoin and potentially leverage it for their future.</p>
<h2><strong>Bitcoin Diploma Graduation Ceremony</strong></h2>
<p>El Salvador&#8217;s 2021 decision to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender was a groundbreaking move. The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-goes-to-school-in-el-salvador/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">&#8220;Bitcoin Diploma&#8221; program</a> reflects the country&#8217;s commitment to educating its citizens about this new financial tool.</p>

<p></p>
<p>The program boasts government support from the Ministry of Education and has developed a comprehensive curriculum with open-source materials like its financial literacy workbook available on GitHub. This workbook&#8217;s reach extends beyond El Salvador&#8217;s borders, with The Node Network program utilizing it in 18 countries.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/04/03/el-salvador-welcomes-the-bitcoin-week-pilgrimage/?sh=e708dd69501a" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">graduation ceremony</a> in San Bartolo saw 120 students put their newfound knowledge to the test. Verifiers, comprised of developers, engineers, and finance professionals, assessed their skills in tasks like creating a backup wallet and using the Bitcoin Lightning Network for transactions.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/YeWUSN0O/" width="2475" /></p>

<p>While the graduation signifies a significant achievement, El Salvador&#8217;s Bitcoin adoption journey faces hurdles. Despite the educational push, Bitcoin usage for everyday purchases remains low.</p>
<p>Only an estimated 20% of merchants currently accept Bitcoin, with tourist hotspots like Bitcoin Beach leading the way in adoption. This uneven distribution raises concerns about the program&#8217;s effectiveness in reaching the broader population, particularly those in rural areas.</p>

<p></p>
<h2><strong>Navigating El Salvador&#8217;s Bitcoin Experiment</strong></h2>
<p>El Salvador&#8217;s foray into Bitcoin education is a bold experiment with the potential to influence other nations. The program&#8217;s emphasis on practical skills and global reach through The Node Network are positive indicators.</p>
<p>The celebratory graduation ceremony further highlights the government&#8217;s commitment to fostering a Bitcoin-positive environment.</p>
<p>However, the program&#8217;s long-term success hinges on addressing the low merchant adoption rate. Incentivizing businesses to accept Bitcoin and bridging the digital divide in rural areas are crucial steps.</p>

<p>The future career prospects for these Bitcoin Diploma graduates also remain unclear. Creating a job market that values their newfound skills will be essential to ensure the program empowers them economically.</p>
<p>El Salvador&#8217;s Bitcoin education program is a work in progress. The graduation ceremony marks a significant first step, but the real test lies in integrating Bitcoin into the everyday lives of Salvadorans.</p>
<p>The coming years will reveal whether El Salvador&#8217;s gamble on Bitcoin education pays off, potentially paving the way for other countries to follow suit.</p>

<title>Dogecoin Bullish Fractal Returns. Here’s What It Means For DOGE Price</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-bullish-fractal-returns/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-bullish-fractal-returns/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。狗狗币在最近的价格行动中遇到了困难，价格已经下降了20%，无法保持在0.2美元的支撑水平上。分析师Ali Martinez指出，狗狗币的价格走势与2018年至2021年的模式相似，并形成了一个可能推动其进入大规模抛物线牛市的bullish fractal。尽管DOGE在过去一周的价格行动中表现良好，但市场仍在整固中，DOGE可能达到12美元的价格水平，这意味着其市值将进入万亿美元阈值。 <div>
<p>Dogecoin has clearly had a hard time keeping up its gains, as shown by recent price action. Dogecoin&#8217;s price has already dropped by 20% <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-price-breaks-new-3-year-high-here-are-factors-that-could-drive-the-price-to-1/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">from its $0.223 price</a> on the last day of March as <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-major-roadblock/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">bulls have failed</a> to keep it above the support level at $0.2. </p>
<p>Crypto analyst Ali Martinez has reiterated his stance on the future outlook of the meme cryptocurrency. According to him, DOGE&#8217;s recent price action has largely mirrored the 2018-2021 pattern. Particularly, the crypto cemented a break out from a descending pattern and has now formed a bullish fractal that could push it into a massive parabolic bull run. </p>
<h2>Dogecoin Bulls Losing Steam After Bull Run</h2>
<p>The majority of cryptocurrencies <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-struggle-67k/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">have turned red</a> in their price action in the past seven days as they&#8217;ve bled some of their gains in March. Memecoins, particularly Dogecoin, hasn&#8217;t been left out of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/fear-grips-xrp-market-as-liquidations-top-6-million-details/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">the consolidation</a>, registering a 10.75% downturn in the past seven days. Interestingly, most of this outflow has come in the last two days as the meme coin has decreased by around 7.7%, which is in line with the correction observed in Bitcoin. </p>

<p>DOGE has only had a few years of price action to look at historical performance, but the analyst has pointed out on social media a recurring trend in its movement. According to the DOGE chart shared by Martinez, DOGE went on a consolidation phase from 2018 to 2021, in which it formed a series of lower highs and a relatively straight price bottom. A final breakout of the upper trendline saw the meme coin spiking by epic proportions to reach its current all-time high of $0.7316. </p>
<p>Current price action shows a similar formation since reaching this all-time high in 2021. Notably, the meme coin has formed a series of lower highs and a relatively straight price bottom. The recent bull market has seen it breaking out of the upper trendline. Although it has done fairly well since breaking out, the only step left is an <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-price-600-rally-in-april-crypto-analyst/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">extended price surge</a> past $0.73. </p>
<h2>DOGE To $12</h2>
<p>Despite the wider market consolidation, the market is still <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-enters-new-trend-set-to-drive-price-to-0-3-analyst/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">largely in bullish sentiment</a> and DOGE has now <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/doge/doge-price-prediction-dogecoin-0-1750/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">formed a bullish fractal</a> on the weekly timeframe, giving validity to the recent analysis by Martinez. </p>

<p>Martinez noted in his analysis a repeat of this price surge could see DOGE reaching the $12 price level. This would mean a 6660% increase from the current price level.</p>
<p>While the current DOGE rally does share some similarities with the 2021 pump, there are also key differences in market conditions, one of which is the market cap. At the time of writing, DOGE is trading at $0.1792 with a market cap of $25.7 billion. A $12 price would mean DOGE&#8217;s market cap entering the trillion-dollar threshold. </p>

<title>Memecoin Mania: Data Shows Massive Influx Of Traders Into Dogecoin &amp; Co.</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。最近的链上数据表明，像狗狗币（DOGE）和Shiba Inu（SHIB）这样的memecoin上个月吸引了大量新交易者。新投资者的涌入导致了这些资产的总持有者数目达到了新高，以及交易次数激增。然而，最近这些资产的交易活动已经减缓，表明新用户对这些网络的兴趣正在减弱。这可能会对价格产生影响，而交易次数的激增可能导致这些资产的大幅波动。目前DOGE的价格约为0.18美元，过去7天下跌超过13%。总市值为560亿美元，为本周期创下新高。 <div>
<p>On-chain data suggests that memecoins like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) observed a large influx of fresh traders last month.</p>
<h2>Memecoin Traders &amp; Transactions Both Spiked High Last Month</h2>
<p>In a new <a href="https://twitter.com/intotheblock/status/1775537404545265904" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock discusses the recent trend in the number of traders on the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-founder-buterin-whatmemecoins-could-be/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">memecoin</a> side of the cryptocurrency sector.</p>
<p>According to IntoTheBlock, the number of investors holding their coins since less than 30 days ago (those who bought within the past month) hit a record high last month for this class of assets as a whole.</p>

<p>The chart on the left below shows the trend in this metric and how it breaks down for the various memecoins in the market.</p>
<p><img alt="Dogecoin &amp; Memecoin Traders" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="273" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GKP5OO6WsAA8q2X?format=jpg&amp;name=medium" width="940" /></p>

<p>The chart shows that the number of traders for these coins had shot up to very high levels last month. Dogecoin, the largest asset by market cap, unsurprisingly contributed to the highest rise. &#8220;This indicates a massive inflow of new traders buying memecoins,&#8221; says the analytics firm.</p>
<p>The trader count, however, has cooled off notably since this peak. However, this doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that the new traders who came in have already sold, but rather that some of these investors who purchased may have matured past the 30-day cutoff.</p>
<p>That said, the indicator trend suggests that the influx of new traders coming into the market is no longer of the same intensity as last month. This change is especially drastic in the case of Dogecoin.</p>
<p>The chart on the right side displays the data for the total number of transactions these memecoins handle. As expected, the transaction count also blew up when the record-high influx of new traders was taking place.</p>
<p>New investors mean the onset of new activity for the various networks and, hence, a spike in the total number of moves taking place. Once again, Dogecoin saw the largest spike out of these assets.</p>
<p>Just like the influx of new users has slowed down, though, the transaction activity for memecoins has also hit the brakes recently. This would suggest that users are not interested in making many trades on these networks at the moment.</p>
<p>Historically, the prices have been the most likely to show <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-open-interest-overheat-brace-volatility/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">volatility</a> when there has been high trading interest, so the transaction count may be one to watch as a spike in it could lead to big moves for these assets (the direction of any such moves, though, could go either way).</p>

<p>In another post, IntoTheBlock has also pointed out that the total market cap of the memecoins (that is, the combined valuation of the circulating supplies of these assets at the current spot prices) has registered a new high for the cycle at $56 billion.</p>

<h2>DOGE Price</h2>
<p>When writing, Dogecoin is trading at around $0.18, down over 13% in the last seven days.</p>

<title>Here’s How On Crypto Trader Turned $100 To $8.3 Million On An Ethereum L2 Network</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-100-8-3-million-ethereum/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-100-8-3-million-ethereum/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章介绍了一位加密交易员凭借投资KEYCAT代币在短短六天内赚取830万美元的故事。Larp von Trier从0.1 ETH起步，投资了1.3亿美元的KEYCAT代币，并通过两个钱包获利175万美元。虽然有争议，但这显示了他的交易技巧。此外，还提到了另一位交易员将1800美元投资转化为1100万美元的故事。这表明了交易热情和风险所带来的机会。 <div>
<p>The crypto space is filled with stories of individuals who have become <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/billionaire-with-shiba-inu/">millionaires and billionaires</a> by <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-trader-6-7-million-ethereum/">trading crypto tokens</a>. This time, another individual has been revealed to have made $8.3 million in just six days. </p>
<h2>How This Trader Made $8.3 Million</h2>
<p>On-chain analytics platform Lookonchain revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/lookonchain/status/1775051782735163655?s=20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> that pseudonymous crypto trader Larp von Trier turned 0.1 ETH ($353) into $8.3 million on<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/coinbase-base-opens-doors-featuring-100-dapps/"> layer-2 network Base</a>. He is said to have made a 23,770x profit by investing in $KEYCAT, a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-meme-coins-myro-wif/">meme coin on Base</a>, while it was still trading at a market cap of $2,200. </p>

<p>Von Trier used the $353 to buy $1.3 billion worth of $KEYCAT tokens (13.16% of the token’s total supply) and then sold 344.7 million $KEYCAT for 497 ETH ($1.75 million) through two of his wallets. The trader still holds 971.2 million $KEYCAT (9.71% of the token’s total supply) in six other wallets. These tokens are said to be currently worth about $6.64 million. </p>
<p>This trade looks to have been a breakthrough moment for Von Trier as Lookonchain further revealed that the pseudonymous crypto trader hadn’t had much luck investing in <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/floki-12m-users-using-the-memecoin-via-binance-pay/">meme coins</a> before now. Before buying $KEYCAT, Von Trier had purchased two other Base meme coins, $NORMIE and $NORMILIO, losing $820 and $9,700 from both trades. </p>
<p>Revelations about Von Trier’s profitable trade have drawn mixed feelings from members of the crypto community. Some <a href="https://x.com/MaarsComics/status/1775112612595769646?s=20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">allege</a> that it must be some sort of insider trading, while others <a href="https://x.com/L3O_NGO/status/1775053171259539956?s=20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">complimented</a> his trading skills, considering what it takes to have invested such an amount in a meme coin with such a market cap. </p>
<h2>Just Another Day In Crypto</h2>
<p>Bitcoinist also <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-meme-coin-trader/#:~:text=How%20%241%2C800%20Turned%20Into%20%2411,tokens%20now%20worth%20%2410.9%20million.">recently reported</a> about a meme coin trader who turned $1,800 into $11 million by investing in <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/wif-dogecoin-shiba-inu-parabolic/">Dogwifhat (WIF)</a> while it was still trading below $0.2. Unlike Von Trier, this trader tried to paperhand his holdings but could not offload his WIF tokens, leading him to opt against selling and instead holding. </p>

<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-dogecoin-shib-excitement/">Meme coins</a> continue to provide a means for crypto traders to make such an enormous amount of money within a short time. This is mainly because meme coins are more volatile than the traditional crypto tokens in the market and could quickly go from one to a hundred within the twinkle of an eye. </p>
<p>At the moment, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-network-forces-binance-to-halt-withdrawals/">Solana and Base</a> look to be the two primary chains where meme coin trading is at its peak. Base, in particular, has seen a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/coinbase-newly-launched-layer-2-network-records/">jump in its transaction volume</a> due to this meme coin frenzy. </p>

<title>Bitcoin Bulls Undeterred: Will BTC Prices Follow Rampant Gold?</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-will-btc-prices-follow-rampant-gold/</link>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章指出，尽管比特币价格最近跌至历史高位的12%，但一位分析师仍然看好比特币。分析师认为，2021年当前牛市可能比2021年更强大，得益于技术指标和香港市场动态。美国SEC批准的多个比特币ETF也推动了机构资金流入。此外，金价上涨对比特币也是一种正面影响，而香港可能审批更多的比特币ETF申请，加速市场上涨。 <div>
<p>Despite a recent 12% drop from its all-time high, one analyst remains bullish on Bitcoin. Taking to X, the trader <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/el_crypto_prof/status/1775567339796189211" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">points</a> to a confluence of bullish technical indicators and potential tailwinds, especially developments in Hong Kong.</p>
<h2>Analyst: This Crypto Bull Run is Stronger Than 2021</h2>
<p>When writing, Bitcoin remains under pressure. However, this cool-off follows a sharp expansion that not only saw the coin more than double but also break above all-time highs recorded in 2021. Then, Bitcoin broke history when it soared to roughly $70,000, driven primarily by retailers.</p>
<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/x/cSLx9No8/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Bitcoin price trending upward in the daily chart | Source: BTCUSDT on Binance, TradingView" class="size-full" height="904" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/cSLx9No8/" width="1787" /></a>
<p>The push higher, to an all-time high of $73,800, is at the back of institutions. In January 2024, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved multiple spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Since then, billions have been funneled to these products, issued by BlackRock and Fidelity.</p>

<p>Based on these supportive fundamentals, the analyst thinks the current bull run will likely be stronger than that of 2021. So far, the trader added, numerous bullish signals have been printed by key technical indicators like the Average Directional Index (ADX) and Directional Indicators (DI). </p>
<p>Though prices remain flat, the formation in the daily chart suggests that market participants are upbeat about Bitcoin and crypto in general. </p>
<img alt="BTC bull signals | Source: Analyst on X" class="size-full wp-image-291977" height="523" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GKQTuL1XAAAcGye.jpg?resize=1024%2C523" width="1024" />
<p>Beyond candlestick arrangement, developments around gold are a net positive to Bitcoin. Gold recently broke higher, soaring to as high as $2,300 this week as uncertainty on the United States monetary policy fan demand for the yellow metal. </p>
<p>Even though Bitcoin has been outperforming gold over the years, the analyst notes that as gold reaches record highs, Bitcoin, often referred to as &#8220;digital gold,&#8221; could follow suit.</p>
<h2>Hong Kong Spot Bitcoin ETFs: A Game Changer?</h2>
<p>Events in <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/will-hong-kongs-bitcoin-etfs-outshine-us-peers/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Hong Kong</a> could accelerate the leg up. Following the steps of the United States SEC, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) of Hong Kong might approve multiple applications, allowing the issuing of spot Bitcoin ETF shares to investors of all cadres, including institutions. One applicant includes Harvest Fund Management, an asset manager in mainland China.</p>

<p>The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in Hong Kong could signal a major shift in their approach to BTC investment and regulation. It should be noted that mainland China continues to crack down on crypto. However, Hong Kong is taking a more welcoming approach. </p>

<title>Google Takes On Crypto Scammers With Legal Action</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/google-takes-on-crypto-scammers-legal-action/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/google-takes-on-crypto-scammers-legal-action/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。Google对一群涉嫌进行复杂加密货币诈骗的个人提起诉讼。法庭诉讼指控被告自2019年以来通过Google Play传播了逾87个假应用程序，欺骗了超过10万名全球用户。涉案人员被指控利用虚假应用程序诱骗受害者投资，并通过各种策略欺诈他们。Google宣布采取法律行动，寻求至少75,000美元的损害赔偿，以保护用户并遏制此类不法行为。 <div>
<p>Google has initiated legal proceedings against a cadre of individuals accused of executing a sophisticated crypto scam, as CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/04/google-sues-crypto-scammers-allegedly-uploading-fake-apps-android-app-store.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reports</a> exclusively today. The lawsuit, lodged on Thursday in the Southern District of New York, targets Yunfeng Sun, also known as Alphonse Sun, and Hongnam Cheung, known alternately as Zhang Hongnim or Stanford Fischer, alongside their associates. This legal action represents Google&#8217;s pioneering effort among technology companies to judicially confront the menace of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-crackdown-sec-doj-charge-hyperfund-founders/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">crypto fraud</a>, aiming to establish a precedent for user protection on digital platforms.</p>
<h2>Google Takes Action Against Crypto Fraudsters</h2>
<p>Allegedly operational since at least 2019, the defendants are accused of crafting and disseminating over 87 counterfeit applications through Google Play, hoodwinking upwards of 100,000 global users. The applications, feigning to be legitimate investment and crypto exchange platforms, served as conduits for a grand deceit, employing tactics including, but not limited to, deceptive text message campaigns via Google Voice, promotional endeavors on <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/eu-watchdog-cracks-down-on-crypto-ads/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">YouTube</a> and other media, as well as affiliate marketing strategies to ensnare victims.</p>

<p>Halimah DeLaine Prado, Google&#8217;s general counsel, in an exclusive interview with CNBC Crypto World, articulated the gravity of the situation, highlighting the over one billion dollars lost to cryptocurrency fraud and scams in the US alone during 2023. Prado emphasized the litigation not only as a defensive measure but also as a deterrent:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>This is a unique opportunity for us to use our resources to actually combat bad actors&#8230;to not only use our resources to protect users but to also serve as sort of a precedent to future bad actors that we don’t tolerate this behavior.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The scammers’ modus operandi involved masquerading the fraudulent apps as legitimate by displaying fictitious balances and returns on investments, coupled with strategies to initially permit minor withdrawals to build trust. Victims, lured under the guise of profitable investment opportunities, found themselves unable to recoup their investments or the promised returns, often being conned into further payments under the pretense of withdrawal fees or minimum balance requirements.</p>

<p>A particularly egregious example cited in the lawsuit was the TionRT app, purportedly a crypto exchange platform uploaded to Play in 2022 by an account linked to Sun. The scammers utilized various communication platforms to lure victims with the promise of financial gain, subsequently leaving them high and dry when withdrawal attempts were made.</p>
<p>Google&#8217;s response to the scam was multifaceted, involving not only the removal of the malicious apps upon discovery but also the deployment of a dedicated cybersecurity team to proactively identify and neutralize threats across its services.</p>
<p>The company’s lawsuit seeks damages exceeding $75,000, attributed to investigative expenditures and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/google-eyes-bitcoin-etfs-post-bitcoin-etf-approval/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">resources</a> allocated to maintaining platform safety and integrity. Additionally, Google is pursuing a permanent injunction to bar the defendants and their associates from creating Google accounts or accessing its services henceforth.</p>
<p>At press time, the leading cryptocurrency Bitcoin traded at $66,752.</p>

<title>OneCoin Scammer Gets 4 Years Jail Sentence — Justice Served?</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/onecoin-scammer-gets-4-years-jail-sentence/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/onecoin-scammer-gets-4-years-jail-sentence/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。文章讨论了OneCoin加密货币项目的前法律和合规主管Irina Dilkinska因参与数十亿美元骗局而被美国地区法官判刑。文章提到OneCoin最初是由Ruja Ignatova和Karl Sebastian Greenwood创建的诈骗计划，并指控Dilkinska在其中起着关键作用。文章还提到了其他与OneCoin有关的人员，如前律师Mark Scott和共同创始人Sebastian Greenwood的判决，以及“CryptoQueen” Ruja Ignatova仍然潜逃的情况。文章警告投资者要警惕加密货币骗局，并强调参与大规模加密货币欺诈活动将面临后果。 <div>
<p>OneCoin, the cryptocurrency project that morphed into a notorious pyramid scheme, continues to cast a long shadow. Yesterday, Irina Dilkinska, the former head of Legal and Compliance for OneCoin, was <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/head-legal-and-compliance-multibillion-dollar-cryptocurrency-pyramid-scheme-onecoin-0" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">sentenced to four years in prison</a> by US District Judge Edgardo Ramos for her role in the multi-billion dollar scam.</p>

<p>Dilkinska&#8217;s sentencing marks another step in the ongoing legal saga surrounding OneCoin. Launched in 2014 by Ruja Ignatova and Karl Sebastian Greenwood, OneCoin promised investors a revolutionary new cryptocurrency. However, authorities allege that the project was a fraudulent scheme from the outset, designed to enrich its founders at the expense of unsuspecting victims.</p>

<h2>OneCoin Scammer: A Big Catch</h2>
<p>&#8220;Rather than upholding the law and fulfilling her responsibility as head of legal, Ms. Dilkinska actively participated in the scheme,&#8221; said Damian Williams, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. &#8220;She facilitated money laundering and aided in the exploitation of millions.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to court documents, Dilkinska played a key role in the OneCoin operation. She allegedly drafted legal documents designed to create a <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/onecoins-legal-and-compliance-head-gets-four-years-in-prison/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">facade of legitimacy</a> and deflect suspicion from regulators. Prosecutors believe she knew, or should have known, that these documents were misleading and ultimately fraudulent.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/aIGCelAS/" width="2475" /></p>

<p>Dilkinska&#8217;s conviction comes on the heels of similar punishments for other OneCoin participants. Earlier this year, Mark Scott, a lawyer who allegedly helped establish fake investment funds to launder money from the scheme, received a 10-year prison sentence. OneCoin co-founder Sebastian Greenwood was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2022.</p>
<h2>OneCoin &#8220;Queen&#8221; Still At Large</h2>
<p>The most high-profile figure in the OneCoin saga, Ruja Ignatova, remains at large. Nicknamed &#8220;CryptoQueen&#8221; by some media outlets, Ignatova vanished from public view in 2017 and is currently on the FBI&#8217;s Ten Most Wanted Fugitives List. The agency is offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to her arrest.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-291886" height="480" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/a_9b3492.png?resize=675%2C480" width="675" /></p>
<p>While authorities have made significant progress in dismantling the OneCoin operation, the case serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of crypto scams. Experts warn that fraudsters are adept at exploiting the complexities and hype surrounding the cryptocurrency market to lure unsuspecting investors.</p>

<p>The OneCoin saga is far from over. Authorities are likely to continue their pursuit of Ignatova, and civil lawsuits from defrauded investors are expected to linger for years to come. However, the dismantling of the organization and the sentencing of key figures sends a clear message: there will be consequences for those who participate in large-scale cryptocurrency fraud.</p>

<title>Why Is Shiba Inu Price Down Today?</title>

<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/why-is-shiba-inu-price-down-today/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。文章指出了狗狗币价格下跌的根源，主要原因是比特币价格崩溃引发的市场恐慌。狗狗币在过去一周内下跌了14%，交易量也大幅下降。尽管市场面临负面影响，但有分析师认为狗狗币的价格可能会在未来上涨，尽管需要在现有低点停止下跌。 <div>
<p class="p2"><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-burn-rate-17000/">Shiba Inu is seeing some downside</a> today that has sent its price below its support level. This downside has its roots in a number of things, with some attributing directly to the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-eyes-the-gold-throne-market-guru-says/">Bitcoin price</a>. However, the outlook for the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-community-scams-2/">meme coin</a> may not be completely bleak as time moves forward.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Shiba Inu 14% On The Weekly Chart</h2>
<p class="p2">In the last week, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-flip-dogecoin-shib/">Shiba Inu price</a> has followed the likes of Bitcoin and Dogecoin as they lose the majority of their gains from the prior week. The daily drawdown itself has seen the meme coin drop around 2% to bring it back below $0.000027, a level which had served as significant support at the start of the week.</p>

<p class="p2">One of the major reasons behind the decline is the Bitcoin price crash which came as a result of rising outflows from <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/goldman-sachs-maintains-crypto-skepticism/">Spot Bitcoin ETFs</a>. This crash in the Bitcoin price naturally spread to the rest of the market, causing what can be described as a cascading effect on altcoins.</p>
<p class="p2">Since the crash began on Monday, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-whale-transactions-2/">Shiba Inu price</a> is down by over 14% and has continued to show weakness even now. At the same time, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-whale-transactions-2/">SHIB</a> has also seen a notable decline in its trading volume. According to data from CoinMarketCap, its daily trading volume fell 28% in the last day.</p>
<p class="p2">Usually, when trading volume is down, it means investors are no longer as interested in trading a coin and may have moved somewhere else or may even be waiting out the bear trend. This can adversely affect the cryptocurrency’s price, especially when holders begin panic selling, thinking the price will keep falling.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Not All Bad News For SHIB</h2>
<p class="p2">Despite the negative headwinds that continue to plague <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-community-scams-2/">the meme coin</a> at this time, it is not all bad news for Shiba Inu. This is because <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-turns-bullish-crypto/">crypto analysts believe that the drawdown is only temporary</a> and that the SHIB price is destined to soar in the future.</p>

<p class="p2">One such crypto analyst took to the TradingView website to <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/chart/SHIBUSDT/xd2KDv5D-SHIB-X-RIGHT-PRICE-FOR-2024/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">outline</a> their expectations for the meme coin. The analysis shows the multiple possible price points for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-whale-transactions-2/">SHIB as it starts to move up</a>. However, they explain that the coin would need to stop bleeding, and only when the selling stops would it be able to move up.</p>
<p class="p2">The crypto analyst also identifies a ‘Distribution Price’ for the coin, which they place at $0.00008488. But the coin still has a lot way to as the analyst explains that price will need to first drop to $0.00001249.</p>
<p class="p2">“A correct move should have been to come back to that level and finish the retest but it has left a trap for repeat cycle perhaps. Watch the area for $0.00001045,” the analyst said.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章介绍了K9 Finance在Shibarium区块链上改进DeFi景观的战略愿景，包括三个阶段的路线图。第一阶段是Hesper，用于测试和学习，强调适应性和基础发展。第二阶段是Boro，代表主网演进和对DeFi领域的影响。第三阶段是Caninae，旨在实现K9 Finance在Shibarium上的去中心化流动锁定产品的愿景。同时，还介绍了K9 Finance的治理模型和对Shibarium采用的努力。 <div>
<p>In the latest publication of Shiba Inu Magazine, the feature <a href="https://magazine.shib.io/article/660d0a4bf999e30001fce8d4" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">article</a> titled “Building the Future: K9 Finance&#8217;s Strategic Vision for a DeFi Revolution on Shibarium” by Yona Gushiken presents an in-depth analysis of K9 Finance’s strategic plan to enhance the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape on the Shibarium blockchain.</p>
<p>With a focus on innovation, community engagement, and the evolution of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shibarium-shiba-inu-perks-new-partner/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">liquid staking derivatives (LSDs)</a>, K9 Finance outlines a comprehensive three-phase roadmap that draws inspiration from the evolutionary journey of canines, reflecting a natural progression towards resilience, strength, and innovation.</p>
<h2>K9 Finance&#8217;s Roadmap To Boost Shiba Inu</h2>
<p>The roadmap begins with the introduction of “Hesper” in late Q2, a foundational stage named after the Hesperocyoninae, the ancient ancestors of modern dogs, symbolizing the project’s nascent steps in testing and learning within the blockchain ecosystem. This phase emphasizes adaptability and foundational development, critical for the project&#8217;s future scalability and functionality.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hesper is our homage to the resilience and versatility that is crucial in the early stages of development. It&#8217;s about laying a strong, adaptable foundation that is responsive to the community&#8217;s feedback and the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-defi-tvl-rockets-80-impact-on-sol-price/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">DeFi landscape</a>&#8216;s shifts,&#8221; explains Buzz, the K9 Finance DAO founder, shedding light on the project&#8217;s strategic beginnings.</p>

<p>Transitioning into Q3, K9 Finance plans to launch “Boro” on mainnet, a phase named after the Borophaginae, known for their formidable presence. This stage represents the project&#8217;s mainnet evolution, showcasing its robustness and potential to impact the Shiba Inu DeFi ecosystem significantly. Buzz comments on this phase, stating, &#8220;Boro signifies our readiness to confront and redefine the DeFi space with resilience and innovation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The roadmap culminates in Q4 with Caninae, reflecting the diversity and adaptability of contemporary canine species. This phase aims to fully realize K9 Finance&#8217;s vision for a decentralized liquid staking product on Shibarium, marking the pinnacle of its development efforts.</p>
<p>Buzz articulates the significance of this stage: &#8220;With Caninae, we not only finalize our product but also solidify our commitment to leading the charge in DeFi <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inus-shibarium-hits-new-record-amid-chaotic-market-movements/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">innovation on Shibarium</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p></p>
<p>Central to K9 Finance&#8217;s strategy is its governance model, which embodies the principles of democratic participation and transparency. The governance process starts in the forums of K9 Finance DAO, where community members discuss and refine proposals.</p>

<p>These proposals then proceed to the &#8220;Roundtable of Dogs&#8221;, a council that plays a critical role in shaping the project&#8217;s direction. The ultimate decision on proposals rests with the community, through Snapshot voting, ensuring every voice is heard and valued. Buzz emphasizes the importance of this process, stating, &#8220;Our governance model is the heartbeat of K9 Finance, ensuring that our trajectory is always aligned with the community’s vision.&#8221;</p>
Fostering Shibarium Adoption
<p>The feature article also delves into Buzz’s role as the Official Developer Advocate for Shibarium, illuminating his dedication to fostering a supportive ecosystem for developers. Drawing inspiration from figures like Ethereum&#8217;s <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-founder-shiba-inu/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Vitalik Buterin</a>, Buzz discusses the challenges and opportunities in advocating for Shibarium, emphasizing the importance of creating a robust support system for developers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Navigating the complexities of blockchain development requires a solid foundation of support and resources. As Shibarium&#8217;s advocate, my mission is to ensure developers have what they need to innovate and succeed,&#8221; Buzz shared, underlining his commitment to the community.</p>
<p>Buzz also provides insights into Shibarium’s unique strengths, including its technological capabilities and the vibrant Shib Army community, positioning it as a formidable contender in the blockchain space. &#8220;What sets Shibarium apart is not just its technology but the incredible community behind it. It&#8217;s a powerful combination that drives us toward innovation and excellence,&#8221; Buzz comments, capturing the essence of Shibarium’s appeal.</p>
<p>At press time, Shiba Inu traded at $0.00002691.</p>

<title>Ripple CLO Counters Gurbir Grewal Criticisms, Defends Crypto Industry’s Compliance</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-clo-counters-gurbir-grewal-criticisms/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-clo-counters-gurbir-grewal-criticisms/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。文章讨论了Ripple首席执行官反驳美国证券交易委员会(SEC)主任Gurbir Grewal对加密公司违规行为的指控。Grewal表示加密行业长期存在违规问题，并批评SEC在执法措施上越界。Ripple CLO指出Grewal忽略了SEC在某些案件中滥用权力的行为，同时呼吁对加密行业进行明确修改以带来法规的清晰性。 SEC的监管方式对机构和行业造成伤害，有必要纠正这种错误的加密战争。 SEC委员Peirce也批评了SEC对加密行业的监管立场，并特别关注了SAB 121的问题。 <div>
<p>In a fight for regulatory clarity, Ripple Chief Executive Officer (CLO) Stuart Alderoty has<a href="https://x.com/s_alderoty/status/1775658309355487693?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> fired back</a> at the United States Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s (SEC) Director Gurbir Grewal&#8217;s claims of non-compliance among crypto firms within the cryptocurrency industry.</p>
<h2>Ripple CLO Slams US SEC&#8217;s Directors Remarks</h2>
<p>During a two-day <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gurbir-remarks-sec-speaks-04032024" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SEC Speaks</a> event sponsored by the Practicing Law Institute held on Wednesday, Gurbir Grewal criticized the crypto industry highlighting the sector&#8217;s noncompliance over the years. </p>

<p>Grewal claims that the cryptocurrency sector has long struggled with non-compliance and has devised inventive strategies to elude the SEC&#8217;s jurisdiction. He also addressed allegations that the regulatory watchdog is picking winners and losers in the market and going beyond its authority in enforcement measures.</p>
<p>He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Over the past decade, we have confronted significant non-compliance and many, many creative attempts by market participants to avoid our jurisdiction, with some claiming that we are making it up as we go or regulating by enforcement, and others arguing that we are recklessly exceeding our authorities.</p></blockquote>
<p>Responding to the remarks, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-2-major-technical-advances-xrp-ledger/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ripple</a> CLO Stuart Alderoty noted that Grewal contended that the unit tasked with enforcing crypto laws operates honorably, but he disregards the DebtBox penalties for egregious misuse of authority in certain cases. These include the Ripple Judge&#8217;s admonishment for not having shown faithful allegiance to the law and the arbitrary and capricious decision in the Grayscale lawsuit.</p>
<p>Alderoty further asserted that the Director quoted a single part from the Ripple verdict, but he failed to mention that the SEC lost the case or abandoned most of its claims. Specifically in the case where the Court rejected the agency&#8217;s allegation that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-wont-make-you-rich/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">XRP</a> was by itself a security.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-clo-sec-crypto/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">CLO</a> also addressed Gurbir&#8217;s statement regarding the Howey test. Gurbir attests that the SEC has been protecting cryptocurrency investors for years by applying Howey and its offspring clearly and consistently. &#8220;We have applied it to the alleged facts in dozens of orders, complaints, and briefs,&#8221; he added. However, Alderoty believes that the guidance adopted by the agency, arbitrarily adds and removes elements from the Howey test.</p>
<p>As a result, this has created greater confusion in the words of the Commission&#8217;s former General Counsel. Thus, Alderoty has called for a lucid amendment to the crypto landscape.</p>
<h2>A Call For Clear Modification Toward The Crypto Sector</h2>
<p>The SEC&#8217;s regulatory approach over the years has previously harmed both the agency and the industry. According to Alderoty, the Commission needs to get off its soapbox and face these truths if it is sincere about repairing the institutional harm triggered by this misguided war on crypto over time.</p>

<p>While Gurbir has taken a swing at crypto, SEC&#8217;s Commissioner <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/hester-peirce-slams-regulators-approach-lrby-case/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Hester Peirce</a> has expressed her disapproval of the Commission&#8217;s regulatory stance toward the sector, concentrating in particular on Staff Accounting Bulletin 121 (SAB 121).</p>
<p>Drawing attention to the SAB 121, Peirce highlighted that it does not safeguard investors. Rather, it keeps seasoned banks and broker-dealers out of the cryptocurrency custodian market, due to its capital implications.</p>

<title>Move Over Gold, Bitcoin Eyes The Throne, According To Market Guru</title>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是中性的。文章讨论了比特币和黄金之间的存储财富的争论，分别从Peter Brandt和Eric Balchunas的观点进行了观点对比。Brandt支持比特币，并指出其长期增长潜力，而Balchunas强调金的吸引力，尤其是在市场波动时期。双方对比特币的波动性和监管环境提出了担忧，尽管比特币被视为对传统金融系统的一种对抗。然而，金作为传统的稳定储值资产，因其实物属性和供应限制而备受追捧。文章指出，投资者需要根据风险承受能力和投资目标来权衡选择比特币还是黄金。文章强调未来的不确定性，比特币能否脱颖而出，或者黄金能否保留其地位。 <div>
<p>The age-old debate over how best to store wealth reignites as Bitcoin and gold lock horns. Peter Brandt, a veteran financial trader, throws his weight behind Bitcoin, claiming it will dethrone gold as the long-term champion.</p>

<p>Brandt cites a chart showcasing the leading cryptocurrency&#8217;s meteoric rise against gold over the past 12 years, suggesting a clear trend. However, Eric Balchunas, a Bloomberg ETF analyst, presents a counterpoint. He highlights a recent influx of investor interest in gold, with trading volumes even surpassing a popular Bitcoin ETF (IBIT).</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">In a longer-term frame, Bitcoin is King over Gold and should remain on the throne for a very long time. Think of BTC as the ruler, Gold is the baron and Silver as the court-jester <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">$BTC</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GC_F&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">$GC_F</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SI_F&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">$SI_F</a> <a href="https://t.co/Uz9k3aoMg4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/Uz9k3aoMg4</a></p>

<p></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Vs. Gold: The Clash Of Viewpoints</h2>
<p>This clash of perspectives reflects the ongoing uncertainty surrounding Bitcoin&#8217;s future. Proponents like Brandt emphasize its potential for long-term growth, fueled by its innovative nature and finite supply. The crypto asset&#8217;s rise coincides with a growing distrust in traditional financial systems, with some viewing it as a hedge against inflation and economic instability.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Gold mounting comeback, <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24GLD&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">$GLD</a> seeing volume than <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24IBIT&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">$IBIT</a>, probably bc gold on nice run lately while btc struggles (altho btc still trouncing gold by 3x since spot launch).

<p>— Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1775268022506381683?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">April 2, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>However, Bitcoin&#8217;s detractors point to its volatility as a major drawback. The recent price correction, which saw<a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> Bitcoin</a> lose significant value in a short period, exemplifies this risk. Furthermore, Bitcoin&#8217;s regulatory landscape remains murky, with some governments wary of its decentralized nature. This uncertainty can deter institutional investors seeking stability.</p>
<p>Gold, on the other hand, boasts a long and illustrious history as a store of value. Its tangible nature and limited supply have made it a safe haven during times of economic turmoil. Recent geopolitical tensions have driven investors towards gold, seeking its traditional stability. Additionally, gold&#8217;s established role in the global financial system makes it a familiar and trusted asset class.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/qgQjZgY8/" width="2475" /></p>

<p>The recent surge in gold&#8217;s trading volume could be a temporary blip, as Balchunas suggests. Investors may be seeking refuge in gold after Bitcoin&#8217;s price tumble. However, it could also signal a more enduring shift in market sentiment. The long-term viability of<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-bank-of-america-now-offer-bitcoin-etfs/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> Bitcoin ETFs</a> like IBIT also remains to be seen. If these funds experience outflows, it could further dampen investor enthusiasm for Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the battle between Bitcoin and gold is a complex one, with strong arguments on both sides. Investors must weigh their risk tolerance and investment goals when deciding where to allocate their assets.</p>
<p>Those seeking high-growth potential with the ability to disrupt traditional finance might favor Bitcoin. However, they must be comfortable with significant price swings and a rapidly evolving regulatory landscape. Conversely, those prioritizing stability and a proven track record may find solace in gold.</p>
<p>The future remains unwritten. Whether Bitcoin emerges as the undisputed king, or gold retains its crown, the battle for financial supremacy promises to be a captivating one to watch.</p>

<title>KC Cattle Company Adopts Bitcoin As Primary Reserve Treasury Asset</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/kc-cattle-company-adopts-bitcoin/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/kc-cattle-company-adopts-bitcoin/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。肯萨斯城牛肉公司决定将比特币作为主要储备资产，以解决行业内不断侵蚀的购买力和成本上升的问题。他们计划很快接受比特币支付，并计划采用闪电网络以加快交易速度。公司认为比特币的开源支付和通信特性可以帮助他们摆脱资金没收问题。此外，他们坚定地选择比特币而非XRP，因为愿景技术无法复制。 <div>
<p>On Wednesday, the Kansas City Cattle Company, known for its premium Wagyu beef products, announced on X (formerly Twitter) its strategic decision to adopt Bitcoin as its primary <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/microstrategy-1-of-all-bitcoin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">reserve treasury asset</a>. This decision by the veteran-owned and operated enterprise, celebrated for its world-renowned gourmet uncured all-Wagyu beef hot dog, marks a significant pivot towards financial innovation, motivated by the urgent need to address the eroding purchasing power and rising costs in the industry.</p>
<p>“The Kansas City Cattle Company has now adopted Bitcoin as a primary reserve treasury asset. The debilitating loss in purchasing power combined with the increases in costs in our industry have made this one of our easiest decisions we&#8217;ve ever made. Fix the money. Fix the Food,&#8221; KC Cattle openly <a href="https://twitter.com/KCCattleCompany/status/1775549342998557089" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">declared</a>.</p>
<p>The announcement has quickly garnered attention from the Bitcoin community, prompting questions about the possibility of accepting BTC for purchases. To this, KC Cattle responded with a promising &#8220;Soon,&#8221; indicating imminent plans to integrate cryptocurrency into their transaction processes.</p>

<p>When asked about the potential adoption of Lightning Network for faster transactions, KC Cattle thanked the inquirer and reiterated their commitment to adopting the technology &#8220;soon,&#8221; signaling a forward-thinking approach to enhancing customer service through the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-lightning-network-failure-david-marcus/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Lightning Network</a>.</p>
<h2>Why Bitcoin?</h2>
<p>The decision to pivot towards Bitcoin was not made lightly. &#8220;In our case, it was a few years of research on both Bitcoin and what&#8217;s happening in the beef industry. It is our opinion that open sourced communication and open sourced payments will be necessary to escape confiscation of funds like what <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/paypal-158m-stablecoin-shaken-by-sec-subpoena/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">PayPal</a> did to us,&#8221; KC Cattle revealed when discussing the motivations behind their groundbreaking decision.</p>
<p>The &#8220;ah HA!&#8221; moment for KC Cattle came through a dual realization: the individual understanding of proof of work&#8217;s potential and the collective acknowledgment that to challenge the market&#8217;s heavyweights, innovative approaches were necessary. This insight is particularly poignant in an industry dominated by four major companies—Tyson, Cargill, National Beef, and JBS—which collectively control 85% of the US beef market.</p>

<p>KC Cattle&#8217;s recommendation for businesses looking to embrace Bitcoin underscores the importance of education and engagement with leading Bitcoin-focused platforms. &#8220;We recommend becoming a great student of what&#8217;s out there from Bitcoin only companies. Check out River, Unchained Com, Swan, Strike. They are all consistently competing on innovation and customer experience so fast for different parts of the Bitcoin standard business,&#8221; they advised.</p>
<p>Responding to a suggestion to consider XRP as well, KC Cattle Company differentiated their stance based on their commitment to Bitcoin&#8217;s foundational technology. &#8220;We have. The Proof of Work consensus protocol is more of a discovery than an invention that cannot be replicated. We also do not align with allocation of ripple resources to Greenpeace USA for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/greenpeace-bitcoin-lie-destroyed-brutal-post/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">intentionally inaccurate reporting</a>. We might know some things about methane,” they explained, highlighting their dedication to informed, principled decisions in their financial practices.</p>
<p>At press time, BTC traded at $65,786.</p>

<title>Goldman Sachs Maintains Crypto Skepticism Amid Contradictory Actions And Bitcoin ETF Surge</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。Goldman Sachs财富管理首席投资官对加密货币持怀疑态度，认为加密货币不是合法的投资资产类别。她认为加密货币是投机性投资，对未监管市场表示担忧。尽管如此，Goldman Sachs全球数字资产主管预计区块链资产的交易量将大幅增加。即使对加密货币投资持置疑态度，Goldman Sachs还是积极参与加密货币生态系统。投资者对比特币ETF的兴趣持续增加，虽然Goldman Sachs对此持怀疑态度，但其他主要平台和网络预计最终将批准比特币ETF。 <div>
<p>In a recent interview, Sharmin Mossavar-Rahmani, the chief investment officer of Goldman Sachs Wealth Management, <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/04/03/goldman-sachs-crypto-skeptics-wall-street-bitcoin-etfs/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">expressed </a>her skepticism towards cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC). </p>
<p>Despite the notorious growth in trading volume and institutional adoption of Bitcoin through the approved spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), Mossavar-Rahmani emphasized that Goldman Sachs does not consider cryptocurrencies a legitimate investment asset class.</p>
<h2>Goldman Sachs CIO Skeptical Of ‘Unregulated’ Crypto Markets</h2>
<p>During the interview, Mossavar-Rahmani highlighted the alleged challenge of valuing cryptocurrencies, which she said &#8220;lacks&#8221; traditional valuation metrics such as earnings, dividends, or cash flow. </p>

<p>According to Mossavar-Rahmani, it becomes “difficult” to take bullish or bearish positions on cryptocurrencies without the ability to assign a value. This sentiment has reportedly led many of Goldman Sachs&#8217; clients to avoid seeking investment advice in the crypto space despite Bitcoin&#8217;s recent surge to a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-breaks-through-69000-setting-new-record/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">new all-time high</a> of $73,700 on March 14. </p>
<p>Mossavar-Rahmani views cryptocurrencies primarily as speculative investments and questions the merit of unregulated markets. She emphasizes the importance of the rule of law and systems of checks and balances in the financial ecosystem. </p>
<p>However, Mossavar-Rahmani’s stance contrasts with those of others in the traditional finance sector, which gradually incorporate cryptocurrencies into their offerings.</p>
<h2>Mixed Messages</h2>
<p>While Mossavar-Rahmani notes that Goldman Sachs may not have a definitive long-term view on Bitcoin or digital assets in portfolios, they are actively engaged in the crypto ecosystem from an infrastructure perspective. </p>
<p>As previously <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/goldman-sachs-remains-bullish-on-bitcoin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">reported </a>by Bitcoinist, Goldman Sachs&#8217; global head of digital assets, Mathew McDermott, expects trading volumes in blockchain-based assets to increase significantly in the coming years, coupled with a notoriously bullish stance on the price of BTC. </p>
<p>Speaking at the Digital Asset Summit (DAS) conference in London, McDermott further noted that while retail investors have been the main drivers of price action, there is a noticeable shift as institutions increasingly show interest and participation in the cryptocurrency market.</p>
Interest In Bitcoin ETFs Despite Public Doubts
<p>In January, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/breaking-spot-bitcoin-etfs-approved-by-us-sec/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">approved 11 spot Bitcoin ETFs</a>, with asset managers such as BlackRock, Fidelity, Grayscale, VanEck, and others issuing these index funds. </p>
<p>The iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) by BlackRock and the Wise Original Bitcoin Fund (FBTC) by Fidelity have emerged as the leading Bitcoin ETFs, accumulating nearly $60 billion in assets under management thus far.</p>
<p>Interestingly, despite Mossavar-Rahmani&#8217;s public skepticism of crypto investments, Bitcoinist has also <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/goldman-sachs-eyes-participant-role-bitcoin-etfs/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">reported </a>the bank&#8217;s interest in playing a &#8220;crucial role&#8221; in the spot Bitcoin ETFs launched by Blackrock and Grayscale (GBTC). This role involves creating and redeeming ETF shares to ensure their alignment with underlying assets. </p>
<p>Major exchanges such as Nasdaq, CBOE, and NYSE Arca have also <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/nyse-options-trading-spot-bitcoin-etfs/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">filed </a>for SEC approval to trade related ETF options, indicating the growing interest in crypto-related financial instruments. </p>
<p>In January, it was <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/morgan-stanley-potential-140-million-bitcoin-move/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">reported </a>that Morgan Stanley is exploring adding spot Bitcoin ETFs to its brokerage platform. If approved, Morgan Stanley would be the first among large registered investment advisor networks and broker-dealer platforms to list the ETFs, potentially paving the way for other major firms to follow suit.</p>

<p>Despite Goldman Sachs&#8217; skeptical stance, industry analysts predict that most major platforms and networks will eventually approve Bitcoin ETFs.</p>
<p>The approval of these ETFs by various platforms is expected to significantly expand Bitcoin&#8217;s addressable market, potentially opening the floodgates for increased inflows from other prominent financial institutions.</p>

<title>Almost 10% Of Bitcoin Supply Bought Above $60,000: Glassnode</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/10-bitcoin-supply-bought-above-60000-glassnode/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/10-bitcoin-supply-bought-above-60000-glassnode/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。根据Glassnode的数据显示，约9.5%的比特币供应在60,000美元以上的水平发生了交易。其中，约1.87万比特币是在高于60,000美元的价格水平被获取的。短期持有者（STH）和长期持有者（LTH）是比特币市场的两个主要分类，根据拥有时间来确定。最近，长期持有者已经减少了他们的比特币供应量，其中约286,000比特币归因于Grayscale比特币信托（GBTC）的资金流出。目前比特币的价格约为66,100美元，过去一周下跌超过3%。 <div>
<p>Data from the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode has revealed that around 9.5% of the Bitcoin supply changed hands above the $60,000 level.</p>
<h2>1.87 Million Bitcoin Was Acquired At Price Levels Higher Than $60,000</h2>
<p>In its latest weekly report, <a href="https://insights.glassnode.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Glassnode</a> has shared how the supply distribution of Bitcoin looks in terms of which levels the investors last bought their coins at.</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Realized Price Distribution" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="993" src="https://i0.wp.com/insights.glassnode.com/content/images/2024/04/Group-137691858--1-.png?resize=2000%2C993&#038;ssl=1" width="2000" /></p>

<p>The chart shows that 9.5% of the entire circulating supply (1.875 million BTC) was bought at prices higher than $60,000. In the same graph, the analytics firm has also highlighted how this distribution breaks down between short-term and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/hodling-steady-bitcoin-long-term-holder-supply-ath/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">long-term holders</a>.</p>
<p>The short-term holder (STH) and long-term holder (LTH) groups make up the two main divisions of the Bitcoin market based on coin holding time.</p>

<p>The cutoff between the two is 155 days, meaning that investors who bought their coins within the last 155 days fall into the short-term holders (STHs) category, while those above belong to the long-term holders (LTHs) category.</p>
<p>As the chart shows, the supply purchased above the $60,000 mark overwhelmingly belongs to the STHs. Interestingly, though, it also includes some LTHs, which would be the holders who bought way back during the 2021 bull run.</p>
<p>It would appear that some of the investors who ended up buying the top back then somehow had the conviction to stand their ground all this time, and now, patience has rewarded them, for they will finally be back in the green (or at least near their break-even mark).</p>
<p>Such a significant part of the supply has been bought at these high levels partly because the asset has gone through a sharp rally recently, which has garnered a lot of interest, so a large amount of buying has been occurring.</p>
<p>The other part of this would be the inflows towards the Bitcoin <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/spot-ethereum-etf-delay-is-a-good-thing/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs)</a>, which have also been occurring at notable scales at these relatively high prices.</p>
<p>Speaking of the STHs and LTHs, the latter is generally considered to include the most stubborn part of the market, as these HODLers don&#8217;t sell very often despite whatever may be happening in the market.</p>
<p>Recently, however, it seems these diamond hands have finally been breaking their silence significantly as their supply has been riding a downtrend.</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Long-Term Holders &amp; Short-Term Holders" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="1152" src="https://i0.wp.com/insights.glassnode.com/content/images/2024/04/Group-137691869.png?resize=2000%2C1152&#038;ssl=1" width="2000" /></p>

<p>The chart shows that the Bitcoin LTHs have shed 900,000 BTC from their supply since December. It would appear that these HODLers have been harvesting the profits they would have accumulated during their long haul.</p>

<p>Glassnode points out that around 286,000 BTC from this can be attributed to the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) outflows.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $66,100, down more than 3% over the past week.</p>

<title>Binance Denies Decision-Making Power Of Detained Executive In Nigeria Amid Mounting Charges</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/binance-denies-decision-making-detained-executive/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/binance-denies-decision-making-detained-executive/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。文章介绍了加密货币交易所币安被卷入风波的情况。币安发表了一份正式声明，为被拘留的执行官提尔甘·甘巴雷安辩护，并强调他在公司内没有决策权。尼日利亚政府对币安提出了额外指控，加剧了交易所面临的法律挑战。同时，另一名被控的高管成功使用伪造护照于三月份逃离尼日利亚。币安与尼日利亚监管机构进行对话的努力受到了额外指控的打击。这种法律冲突的发展使币安在尼日利亚的未来变得不确定。 <div>
<p>Binance, one of the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, is entangled in a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/nigeria-crackdown-binance-authorities-demand/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">complex situation in Nigeria</a>. With no resolution in sight, the exchange has finally issued an official statement regarding its detained executive, Tigran Gambaryan, who faces money laundering charges after five weeks in custody. </p>
<p>As the Nigerian government introduces additional <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-suspends-all-operations-in-nigeria/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">charges </a>against Binance, the exchange strives to dialogue with local regulators. </p>
<h2>Binance Defends Detained Executive</h2>
<p>According to Binance&#8217;s <a href="https://www.binance.com/en/blog/all/statement-regarding-tigran-gambaryan-2326990525324609917" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">official statement</a>, Tigran Gambaryan, the detained executive, is portrayed as a former law enforcement professional not part of the exchange&#8217;s management. Although he left the official service of the US government, Gambaryan has continued to operate as a global advocate for good governance and transparent regulatory financial practices, the statement claims. </p>

<p>Binance asserts that Gambaryan has no decision-making power within the company and respectfully requests that he not be held responsible. At the same time, discussions between Binance and Nigerian government officials are ongoing. The exchange further noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>Tigran is so well known as the world’s preeminent cyber crimes investigator that a book, Tracer’s in the Dark, was written about his efforts to bring down some of history’s most notorious cyber criminals. </p></blockquote>
<p>Binance reveals that Gambaryan was <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/nigeria-detains-binances-crypto-crime-investigator/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">hired in 2021</a> to assist the exchange in addressing past compliance issues. As the head of Binance&#8217;s Financial Crime Compliance (FCC) team, the exchange highlights that he has played a “crucial role” in developing policies and compliance capabilities aimed at setting “new industry standards.” </p>
<p>The company also notes Gambaryan&#8217;s track record, stating that his FCC team has assisted global law enforcement in freezing and seizing over $2.2 billion worth of assets. Notably, they allegedly collaborated with <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/nigeria-fines-binance-10-billion/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">US agencies</a> such as the FBI, DOJ, DEA, and others, recovering more than $285 million. </p>
<p>Before joining Binance, Gambaryan reportedly served as a US Federal Agent, leading high-profile investigations involving national security, terrorism financing, identity theft, child pornography, tax evasion, and bank secrecy act violations.</p>
<h2>Nigeria Intensifies Legal Pressure</h2>
<p>Despite Binance&#8217;s efforts to dialogue with Nigerian regulators, the situation has become more complicated. The Wall Street Journal <a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-jones-04-03-2024/card/binance-and-its-detained-american-staffer-face-more-charges-in-nigeria-ymYObhVbuplBK9gYvhAv" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reported </a>that Nigeria has introduced additional charges against Binance, further escalating the legal challenges faced by the exchange. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Anjarwalla, another executive implicated in the case, managed to escape the country using a fake passport in March, as previously <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-executive-sues-nigerian-government/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">reported </a>by Bitcoinist. </p>

<p>The exchange&#8217;s efforts to establish a dialogue with Nigerian regulators have been met with additional charges. At the same time, the reported escape of another co-accused executive adds another layer of complexity to the situation. As the legal battle unfolds, Binance&#8217;s future in Nigeria remains uncertain.</p>
<img alt="Binance" class="size-large" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/dPojyiIG/" width="1815" />
<p>Binance Coin (BNB), the exchange’s native token, has maintained a sideways trading pattern above the $556 level in the last 24 hours. This comes after a 32% price increase observed over the past month.</p>

<title>Crypto Exchange KuCoin Sees Massive Outflows After DOJ Lawsuit – Report</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-exchange-kucoin-sees-massive-outflows-after-doj-lawsuit-report/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-exchange-kucoin-sees-massive-outflows-after-doj-lawsuit-report/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。文章介绍了加密货币交易所KuCoin近期面临的监管指控，包括违反多项法规和美国反洗钱法。指控导致KuCoin的用户纷纷转移到其他交易所，导致大量资金流出。由于DOJ和CFTC的起诉，KuCoin的代币KCS价格下跌，并且交易量急剧下降。据报道，交易量和市场份额均大幅减少，用户资金流向其他交易所。另一方面，KuCoin持有的资产减少，总流出金额近12亿美元。 <div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">For the past week, crypto exchange KuCoin has been at the center of a regulatory tornado. The charges filed last Tuesday include breaking several regulations and violating anti-money laundering (AML) laws in the United States.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A recent report reveals that the exchange has faced significant challenges after the news of the lawsuits broke out. Despite efforts to stop it, KuCoin’s users are flocking to other exchanges, resulting in massive outflows for the platform.</p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">The Charges Against The Global Crypto Exchange</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On March 26, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Commodity and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) filed back-to-back <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/kucoin-faces-doj-prosecution/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">lawsuits</a> against global crypto exchange KuCoin.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The DOJ charged KuCoin and two of its founders, Chun Gan and Ke Tang, with deliberately failing to maintain an adequate AML program. Additionally, KuCoin was accused of “operating an unlicensed money transmitting business.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As previously <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-designated-as-commodity-by-cftc/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">reported</a>, the CFTC filed a complaint against the crypto exchange for illegal dealing in “off-exchange commodity futures transactions and leveraged, margined, or financed retail commodity transactions.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the exchange was accused of failing to “register with the CFTC as a futures commission merchant (FCM)” and multiple violations of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC regulations.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, the price of KuCoin’s token (KCS) dropped 10% just hours after the news broke out. Since then, KCS dipped 13.1% in the past week and 18.9% from its price 30 days ago.</p>
<p>At writing time, the token is trading at $10.633, a modest 0.6% increase in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="KCS, KCSUSDT, crypto Kucoin" class="aligncenter wp-image-291739 size-large" height="493" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/QgvuvYq3.png?w=980&#038;resize=980%2C493" width="980" /></p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">It’s worth noting that the blockchain research and analytics firm Kaiko found during its research of KuCoin&#8217;s charges impact that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the DOJ’s claims, there is no direct interaction between KuCoin and Tornado Cash on the Ethereum blockchain. However, all of the funds stolen from KuCoin’s hack in 2020 have been “privatized” using Tornado Cash, representing a significant amount of ETH.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">How Did The CFTC And DOJ Indictments Impact KuCoin?</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">KCS’s price isn’t the only thing affected by the regulatory crackdown on the crypto exchange. Kaiko <a href="https://research.kaiko.com/insights/the-impact-of-the-kucoin-charges" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">revealed</a> that the CFTC and DOJ charges had a massive and immediate impact on the crypto exchange.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">KuCoin’s numbers have plummeted in several metrics over the past week despite being one of the fastest-growing exchanges this year.  Per the report, KuCoin’s volume and market share plunged since March 26. The daily volume dropped from $2 billion to $520 million, a 74% decrease.</p>
<p><img alt="crypto exchange, kucoin, DOJ, CFTC" class="size-large wp-image-291743 aligncenter" height="522" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Captura-de-Pantalla-2024-04-03-a-las-9.22.26-a.-m.png?w=979&#038;resize=979%2C522" width="979" /></p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, its market share halved from 6.5% to 3%. The exchange unsuccessfully attempted to stop the daily volume drop by offering a $10 million Airdrop plan.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Kaiko’s data revealed that the exchange&#8217;s <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bleed-grayscale-ceo/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">outflows</a> significantly grew after users transferred their funds to other centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Binance, OKX, Coinbase, MEXC, and Gate.io. As part of their efforts to safeguard their funds, users also sent assets to on-chain wallets directly.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On March 26, the total outflows outpaced KuCoin’s inflows. More than $600 million, primarily in USDT and ETH, were withdrawn from the change after the lawsuit news.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The research platform highlighted that these numbers only contain the on-chain transactions from KuCoin wallets and other exchanges or wallets, excluding transactions between KuCoin addresses.</p>

<p><img alt="Crypto exchange, KuCoin" class="size-large wp-image-291742 aligncenter" height="364" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Captura-de-Pantalla-2024-04-03-a-las-10.05.27-a.-m.png?w=980&#038;resize=980%2C364" width="980" /></p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">According to <a href="https://portfolio.nansen.ai/dashboard/kucoin?tab=analytics" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">data</a> from the on-chain analytics platform Nansen, the assets held by the exchange fell from approximately $6 billion to $4.82 billion. At writing time, KuCoin’s total outflows account for nearly $1.2 billion.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Realized Cap Breaks ATH As Capital Inflows At Unprecedented Rates</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-realized-cap-breaks-ath-capital-inflows/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-realized-cap-breaks-ath-capital-inflows/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />比特币实现市值已经创下历史新高，资本以前所未有的速度流入该加密货币。最近突破了5400亿美元的比特币实现市值，并且每月增长了790亿美元。实现市值一直在上升，并且随着资产价格的上涨而创下新高。这种趋势的原因可能是比特币ETF在本次牛市中的存在，引发了资本的爆炸性需求。当前比特币价格约为66100美元。 <div>
<p>On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Realized Cap has set a new all-time high (ATH) as capital has been flowing into the coin at unprecedented rates.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Realized Cap Recently Crossed The $540 Billion Mark</h2>
<p>In its latest weekly report, the on-chain analytics firm <a href="https://insights.glassnode.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Glassnode</a> has discussed the trend that has recently been taking place in the &#8220;<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-realized-cap-sets-all-time-high-price-next/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Realized Cap</a>&#8221; of Bitcoin.</p>
<p>The Realized Cap here refers to a capitalization model for the cryptocurrency that calculates the total value of the asset by assuming the value of individual coins in circulation to be the same as the price at which they were last transferred on the blockchain rather than the current spot price.</p>

<p>Considering that the last time a coin was transferred on the blockchain was likely the latest instance of it changing hands (that is, a sale of it took place), the Realized Cap would essentially be taking into account the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-short-term-holder-cost-basis-rises-25300/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">cost basis</a> of all coins in circulation.</p>
<p>As such, one way to interpret the model is that it tells us about the total amount of capital that the investors have used to purchase their Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the BTC Realized Cap over the last few years:</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Realized Cap" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="1152" src="https://i0.wp.com/insights.glassnode.com/content/images/2024/04/Group-137691854--1-.png?resize=2000%2C1152&#038;ssl=1" width="2000" /></p>

<p>From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that the Bitcoin Realized Cap has been sharply rising recently and setting new ATHs. This uptrend in the indicator has come as the price of the asset itself has also rallied.</p>
<p>The reason behind the trend in the Realized Cap is naturally that investors have become more active in trading as the price has shot up. Old hands would be moving their coins to harvest their profits, thus resetting the cost basis of their coins to the current high price levels.</p>
<p>&#8220;As these coins change hands, we can also consider this to be an injection of fresh demand and liquidity into the asset class,&#8221; notes the analytics firm. As the chart shows, the 2021 bull run also saw capital rushing into the asset, with the indicator exploring fresh highs over an extended period.</p>
<p>Recently, the Bitcoin Realized Cap has managed to break through the $540 billion level, with the metric&#8217;s value witnessing a monthly growth rate of $79 billion.</p>
<p>This extraordinary rate of capital inflows is unprecedented for the asset. The likely explanation behind this pattern may be the presence of the Bitcoin <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/spot-ethereum-etf-delay-is-a-good-thing/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs)</a> in this bull run.</p>

<p>Spot ETFs, which provide a more traditional mode of investment in cryptocurrency, only received approval in January. Since then, these funds have continuously absorbed the BTC supply.</p>
<p>With this explosive demand that never existed before in the history of the asset, it&#8217;s no wonder that the Realized Cap has also been climbing at an unprecedented rate.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>Bitcoin has experienced a notable drawdown over the past couple of days, as its price is now trading around the $66,100 level.</p>

<title>Shiba Inu Whale Transactions See 340% Surge, Can They Push SHIB To $0.00004?</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-whale-transactions-2/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-whale-transactions-2/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />数据显示狗狗币鲸鱼活动增加，可能成为价格上涨的催化剂。最近几天，鲸鱼交易激增，大额交易量增加了340%。虽然价格在$0.0000257水平上形成支撑，但仍处于下降趋势。鲸鱼交易量激增可能意味着大笔交易者在积累或出售持有的代币。狗狗币社区对当前牛市阶段保持乐观态度，并期待价格回到$0.000044水平。 <div>
<p>Data has shown an increase in activity for Shiba Inu whales, teasing what could be a catalyst for an uptrend. Notably, the past few days have seen a surge in whale transactions, with data revealing a 340% increase in the volume of these large transactions. </p>
<p>With SHIB now <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-turns-bullish-crypto/">trading below $0.00003</a> and forming support at the $0.0000257 level, could the surge in whale transactions turn price action on its heels and lead to a surge?</p>
<h2>Whale Transactions See 340% Surge</h2>
<p>Shiba Inu is home to a lot of whale investors, with large holders holding 73% of the total circulating supply as shown by <a href="https://app.intotheblock.com/coin/SHIB" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">IntoTheBlock data.</a> As a result, activity from these whales is known to move the market, particularly when they move large amounts of coins.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://app.intotheblock.com/coin/SHIB/deep-dive?group=financials&amp;chart=largeTransactions" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">data </a>from ITB, the volume of whale transactions jumped up from 1.4 trillion SHIB on March 21 to 6.16 trillion SHIB in the past 24 hours, representing a surge of over 340% in the space of a few days. </p>
<p>ITB&#8217;s large transaction metric tracks the number and volume of transactions with a value of $100,000 or greater. Interestingly, the number of transactions falling into this category shot up from 157 transactions to 372 transactions in the same time frame. </p>
<h2>What’s Next For Shiba Inu?</h2>
<p>SHIB is currently going through a moderate <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-dips-below-0-00003-again-can-bulls-reverse-the-bullish-momentum/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">price sell-off</a> as the wider crypto industry continues to <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-consolidates-65k/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">perform with lackluster action</a>. Consequently, the price of SHIB has fallen by 10.36% in the past seven days. </p>

<p>At the same time, this interesting surge in transaction volume demonstrates the current dynamic among SHIB traders holding large amounts of the token. This surge in trading volume could mean an increased accumulation from large traders, or they could be selling some of their holdings. An example is a case <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/shiba-inu-shib-slumps-as-whale-sell-off-dampens-momentum-details/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">reported by NewsBTC</a>, in which 11 wallets offloaded 533.6 billion SHIB tokens to realize a joint profit of $8.24 million (+106%) in less than a month.</p>
<p>SHIB consolidation pushed the token&#8217;s price by as much as 13% in the past 24 hours to trade at $0.00002565. However, the bulls have reversed the price into green territory and SHIB is trading at $0.0000271 at the time of writing, up by a meager 0.75% in the past 24 hours. </p>
<p>However, Shiba Inu community members remain steadfast in a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-going-to-0-0001/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">bullish price trajectory</a> in the current bull market phase. Notably, $0.000044 sets the current threshold for how far SHIB has reached this cycle. A return to this price level <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-price-mirrors-2021/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">remains possible</a> as SHIB continues to <a href="https://x.com/Shibtoken/status/1775179483756073256?s=20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">receive global recognition</a>. </p>

<title>Pal: HODL, Crypto Is Being Adopted Twice As Fast As The Internet</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/hodl-cryptoadopted-twice-as-fast-internet/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/hodl-cryptoadopted-twice-as-fast-internet/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章中提到了加密货币市场的价格出现下跌，但创始人表示乐观，并称加密货币和其基本技术的采用速度是互联网的两倍。在2025年底之前，预计加密货币用户将超过10亿。此外，加密货币的强劲基本面包括价格与基本基础相匹配，提振了持币者的信心。大多数分析师认为比特币将在未来突破74,000美元，并飙升至高达100,000美元的预测。央行将对利率的决定可能影响价格，但美国联邦储备委员会可能更少在2024年削减利率。 <div>
<p>Despite a recent price dip in crypto, including Bitcoin, Raoul Pal, the founder of Real Vision, remains bullish, citing accelerating adoption and strong underlying fundamentals. </p>
<p>In a recent post on X, Pal <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/RaoulGMI/status/1775141560713183404" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">said</a> though prices are dropping after strong gains, cryptocurrencies and its underlying technology are being adopted twice as fast as the internet. At this pace, the founder projected a crypto user base of over 1 billion by the end of 2025.
</p>
<img alt="Crypto adoption rate | Source: Analyst on X" class="size-full wp-image-291720" height="579" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GKKRergWIAAHY4O.jpg?resize=1024%2C579" width="1024" />
<h2>HODL: Crypto Has Solid Fundamentals</h2>
<p>Though this may be a mere projection, several factors might accelerate adoption. The sphere has been evolving, improving user interfaces and rolling out solutions that boost accessibility. For instance, some more wallets and exchanges enable the storage of crypto assets. Besides, regulations have been made to clarify the status of top cryptocurrencies. </p>

<p>In the United States, for instance, Bitcoin is recognized as a commodity, and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently approved several spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-spot-etfs-odds-at-a-pessimistic-25/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">ETFs</a>). Barely two months after launching, these vehicles control billions of Bitcoin as institutions dive into the emerging asset class.</p>
<p>Pal seems to argue that Bitcoin and crypto prices align well with existing fundamentals. This preview is a massive boost for crypto holders discouraged by recent events. Bitcoin and top coins, including Ethereum, are under immense selling pressure. After topping out at around $73,800, BTC is now roughly 10% from all-time highs. </p>
<p>At the same time, Ethereum failed to sustain prices above $4,000 and is now edging closer to $3,000. This dump is despite the release of upgrades, including Dencun, that make the network more performant and reliable.</p>
<h2>Analysts Are Bullish: Expect Bitcoin To Rip Higher</h2>
<p>Still, most analysts are bullish. Most dismiss the recent price drop as a temporary correction, suggesting that major players are accumulating. So far, even if the momentum has been slow, spot Bitcoin ETF issuers continue to stack Bitcoin on behalf of their clients, which is a positive development.</p>
<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/x/JNcZZn8B/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Bitcoin price trending downward on the daily chart | Source: BTCUSDT on Binance, TradingView" height="904" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/JNcZZn8B/" width="1787" /></a>
<p>Even with Bitcoin struggling at spot rates, most analysts believe BTC will break out above $74,000 and fly to as high as $100,000 in the sessions ahead. </p>

<p>Still, a key driver to price will be fundamental factors, including the decision the United States Federal Reserve (Fed) will make in the coming session concerning interest rates.</p>
<img alt="Impact of high interest rates on debt repayment | Source: Analyst on X" class="size-full wp-image-291717" height="703" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GKGZDUxWcAApgnV.jpg?resize=950%2C703" width="950" />
<p>Following better-than-expected factory data on April 1, some analysts think the Fed will be less aggressive in slashing interest rates in 2024 than earlier projects. However, if the Fed maintains rates at current levels, the government&#8217;s annual interest payments <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/APompliano/status/1774868013017182424" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">could</a> balloon to $1.6 trillion by December, negatively impacting the economy. </p>

<title>Dogecoin Accumulation Draws To An End, Why DOGE Price Can Reach $1</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-doge-price-can-reach-1/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-doge-price-can-reach-1/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />DOGE被认为将突破历史最高价，可能达到1美元。分析显示DOGE已经突破累积阶段，并在向上的重新测试中。狗熊预测DOGE在今年达到1美元，并表示其下一步将是“爆炸性的”。其他分析师也认为DOGE可能在市场周期内上涨至1美元。此外，DOGE被认为有潜力最终上涨至1美元。 <div>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-price-set-to-sprint-toward-40000/">Crypto analyst Mikybull Crypto</a> has laid out a bullish narrative for the foremost meme coin, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-pundit-predicts-price-surge-for-dogecoin/#:~:text=Crypto%20Pundit%20Predicts%20Massive%20Price%20Surge%20For%20Dogecoin%20%E2%80%93%20Here&#039;s%20The%20Target&amp;text=Crypto%20analyst%20DonAlt%20has%20provided,from%20its%20current%20price%20levels.">Dogecoin (DOGE)</a>. Based on his analysis, DOGE is bound to breach its all-time high (ATH) on its way to unprecedented heights in <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bull-market-glassnode/">this bull run</a>.</p>
<h2>Time For Dogecoin To Run To $1</h2>
<p>Mikybull Crypto revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/MikybullCrypto/status/1775108333382332723?s=20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> that DOGE has already broken out of its accumulation phase and is currently on a retest before making a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-too-much-firepower/">parabolic move</a> to the upside. He hinted that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/big-money-eyes-dogecoin-whale-activity-explodes-600/">DOGE</a> could rise to as high as $1 when this move occurs, as he labeled that price level a “magnet target.”</p>

<p>When one of his followers <a href="https://x.com/314Vibes1/status/1775108760001798473?s=20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">quizzed</a> whether DOGE hitting $1 in 2025 should be expected, Mikybull responded that he believes this price target will be attained this year. The crypto analyst had first hinted at a massive price surge for DOGE in an earlier X post <a href="https://x.com/MikybullCrypto/status/1774746027532427509?s=20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">where</a> he boldly claimed that DOGE’s next move would be “explosive.” He made this statement while revealing that DOGE had achieved a monthly close, which flipped bullish for the first time since 2021.  </p>
<p>Mikybull isn’t the only crypto analyst who has predicted that DOGE could rise to $1 in this market cycle. Crypto analyst DonAlt <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-pundit-predicts-price-surge-for-dogecoin/#:~:text=Crypto%20Pundit%20Predicts%20Massive%20Price%20Surge%20For%20Dogecoin%20%E2%80%93%20Here&#039;s%20The%20Target&amp;text=Crypto%20analyst%20DonAlt%20has%20provided,from%20its%20current%20price%20levels.">previously mentioned</a> that “it isn’t too unlikely for Dogecoin to go to $1.” He also suggested that DOGE was a better investment than Bitcoin, especially if the meme coin eventually hits the $1 price level.</p>
<p>Besides these predictions, there is also a <a href="https://x.com/TOPDOGE007/status/1773313019684036808?s=20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">general feeling of optimism</a> among members of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-community-doge-day/#:~:text=What%20DOGE%20Day%20Is%20All,usually%20celebrated%20during%20DOGE%20Day.">DOGE community</a> that the meme coin can indeed rise to such heights. This belief is further strengthened by the fact that meme coins are one of the leading narratives for this market cycle. As such, new liquidity is expected to flow into DOGE’s ecosystem. </p>
<h2>Dogecoin Could Rise To $1 Eventually </h2>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-too-much-firepower/">Crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa</a> recently <a href="https://x.com/AltcoinSherpa/status/1774507876892954705?s=20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">stated</a> that DOGE could do “something silly like go to $1 this cycle eventually.” Altcoin Sherpa had previously remarked that the foremost meme coin still has a lot of firepower and alluded to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-tesla-ceo-elon-musk/">Elon Musk’s support</a> for it as one of the factors that could drive its price to $1.</p>

<p>The crypto analyst sounded uncertain about when this move could happen, stating that it could be now or six months from now. Meanwhile, just like he warned previously, he once again mentioned in his recent X post that DOGE is unlikely to make the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-10-largest-meme-coin/">same gains</a> as the one in the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-shatters-profit-taking-streak-2021-bull-run/">last bull run</a> because of its market cap. </p>
<p>At the time of writing, DOGE is trading at around $0.18, down in the last 24 hours, according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dogecoin/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">data</a> from CoinMarketCap. </p>

<title>Pro-XRP Lawyer Deaton Accuses Sen. Warren Of Covering Up SBF Fraud</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-deaton-sen-warren-cover-up-sbf/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-deaton-sen-warren-cover-up-sbf/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的<br />在政治和加密领域的不断升级的争端中，支持XRP的律师约翰·迪顿指控美国现任参议员伊丽莎白·沃伦。迪顿指责沃伦在掩盖加密交易所FTX前CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF)的欺诈活动中起了作用。他还将矛头对准了沃伦对加密货币持严格立场的双重标准。迪顿的指控涉及SBF及其家人与政界的关系，强调了政治透明和公平性的重要性。整体来说，这场迪顿对沃伦的竞选活动既是政治竞争，也是美国关于加密货币及其监管角色的持续辩论的体现。 <div>
<p>In an escalating feud within the political and crypto arenas, John Deaton, a pro-XRP lawyer running for the Massachusetts Senate seat, has levied serious allegations against incumbent US Senator Elizabeth Warren. Deaton&#8217;s campaign, initiated in February, positions him as a Republican challenger to Warren, a Democrat known for her stringent stance on cryptocurrencies.</p>
<h2>Pro-XRP Lawyer Deaton Goes Into Attack Mode</h2>
<p>Through a <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1775266191696969887" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">statement</a> on X, Deaton accused Senator Warren of playing a role in obscuring the fraudulent activities of Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), the former CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange FTX. Deaton&#8217;s accusations center on Warren&#8217;s alleged failure to investigate or address the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-sbf-bernie-madoff-of-crypto-democrats-ukraine/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">connections between SBF and various regulatory and governmental figures</a>, despite the emerging details of SBF&#8217;s trial and his political donations.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sam Bankman-Fried now claims that he wasn’t aware stealing money from customers and using it for political donations was illegal,&#8221; Deaton stated, referencing <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-collapse-sam-bankman-fried-trial/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">SBF&#8217;s trial</a> where it was revealed that the FTX founder had donated $10 million to the Biden Administration.</p>

<p>Deaton highlighted SBF&#8217;s interactions with key regulatory figures, including SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, the Chairman of the CFTC, US Treasury, as well as then Chairwoman Maxine Waters of the US House Committee on Financial Services. &#8220;The reason he gave the money, according to the evidence, was &#8216;in order to buy access,'&#8221; Deaton elaborated, shedding light on SBF&#8217;s numerous meetings with top regulatory officials.</p>
<p>Deaton&#8217;s allegations extended beyond SBF&#8217;s personal actions to include a broader critique of the regulatory and political environment surrounding cryptocurrencies. “Now ask yourself, why did the DOJ <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/us-authorities-drop-charges-sbf-campaign-finance/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">dismiss the criminal trial</a> against SBF related to violating campaign finance laws? The American people deserve transparency when it comes to their elected representatives.”</p>
<p>Specifically, he also targeted Warren&#8217;s lack of inquiry into SBF&#8217;s relationships with key figures such as SEC Chairman Gary Gensler, despite her vocal stance on the risks posed by cryptocurrencies. &#8220;Considering her aggressive stance on crypto, why not?&#8221; Deaton questioned, suggesting a double standard in Warren&#8217;s approach to crypto regulation versus her treatment of SBF&#8217;s case.</p>

<p>The accusations also delve into the financial and political connections of SBF&#8217;s family, particularly his parents, who Deaton alleges received $10 million in FTX customer money. The pro-XRP lawyer highlighted their ownership of luxury real estate and suggested that their lack of charges might be due to their political connections, including with Senator Warren.</p>
<p>&#8220;His mother, Barbara Fried, runs a Democratic Super PAC called Mind the Gap. When Senator Warren ran for President, SBF’s father, Joe Bankman, helped formulate Senator Warren’s tax plan,&#8221; Deaton noted, pointing to the intertwined relationships between SBF&#8217;s family and Democratic political figures.</p>
<p>He added, “Joe Bankman happens to also be an expert in creating shell companies for the purposes of tax avoidance. Look at the shell corporations he helped design for his son.”</p>
<p>Overall, Deaton&#8217;s campaign against Warren is not just a political rivalry but also a manifestation of the ongoing debate within the US about the role of cryptocurrencies and their regulation. &#8220;Regular people are sick and tired of different rules being applied to Washington insiders. We need real leadership in Washington DC,&#8221; Deaton concluded, emphasizing his call for transparency and equity in both politics and crypto.</p>
<p>At press time, XRP traded at $0.5798.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Champion Max Keiser Blasts Argentinian President’s Crypto Stance</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-champion-blasts-presidents-crypto-stance/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-champion-blasts-presidents-crypto-stance/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章讨论了阿根廷和萨尔瓦多在处理加密货币方面采取的不同方法。阿根廷总统Javier Milei采取谨慎态度，强调监管和区分比特币与其他加密货币。相比之下，萨尔瓦多总统Bukele将比特币作为法定货币，并推动加密货币的广泛采用，但面临挑战。文章强调阿根廷的谨慎方法可能更加可持续，而萨尔瓦多的大胆举措则可能面临障碍。这为拉丁美洲地区的加密货币未来提供了一个有趣的案例研究。 <div>
<p>Argentina and El Salvador, both facing economic struggles, are taking vastly different approaches to cryptocurrency. While El Salvador became the first country to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in 2021, Argentina&#8217;s new president, Javier Milei, is taking a more measured route, prioritizing regulation and differentiation between the crypto and the broader cryptocurrency landscape.</p>
<h2><strong>Bitcoin Distinction And Regulation</strong></h2>
<p>Milei, a Bitcoin enthusiast, has implemented aggressive economic policies to combat Argentina&#8217;s collapsing peso. His stance on cryptocurrency has drawn both praise and criticism. Proponents see him as a champion for digital assets, while some, like Max Keiser, advisor to El Salvador&#8217;s president Nayib Bukele, believe he&#8217;s making a &#8220;rookie mistake&#8221; by lumping the leading crypto asset with other cryptocurrencies.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">.<a href="https://twitter.com/JMilei?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">@JMilei</a> is making rookie mistake lumping <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">#Bitcoin</a> in with “Crypto”</p>
<p>This sets his agenda back by years.</p>
<p>Pres. <a href="https://twitter.com/nayibbukele?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">@nayibbukele</a> understands <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">#Bitcoin</a> on a deep level and never made this mistake &amp; passed laws clearly stipulating that everything not BTC is an unregistered security.</p>
<p>— Max Keiser (@maxkeiser) <a href="https://twitter.com/maxkeiser/status/1775259468470861983?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">April 2, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>This distinction is crucial. <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bitcoin</a> maximalists like Keiser view the crypto as a unique entity, separate from the volatile world of altcoins. Argentina&#8217;s recent regulation requiring registration for all Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) encompasses all cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. Keiser sees this as a setback, potentially hindering its capacity as an economic tool.</p>

<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-goes-to-school-in-el-salvador/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">El Salvador&#8217;s path</a> offers a contrasting example. By making Bitcoin legal tender alongside the US dollar, President Bukele aimed to promote financial inclusion and reduce remittance fees. However, this bold move hasn&#8217;t been without its challenges.</p>
<p>Widespread adoption has been sluggish, with a limited demographic actively using Bitcoin. Incentives like the Chivo digital wallet haven&#8217;t swayed most Salvadorans, who prefer the familiarity of cash.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/DRXoLPGG/" width="1835" /></p>

<h2><strong>Argentina&#8217;s Cautious Approach</strong></h2>
<p>Argentina&#8217;s approach reflects a concern for stability. The country&#8217;s economic crisis demands solutions that inspire confidence. While Milei hasn&#8217;t ruled out dollarization, his focus on regulation suggests a desire to create a safe environment for cryptocurrency before full integration. The recent registration mandate for VASPs is a first step towards establishing a framework for responsible crypto use.</p>

<p>This cautious approach may prove more sustainable in the long run. El Salvador&#8217;s <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bill-passed-in-el-salvador/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin experiment</a>, while audacious, faces an uphill battle. The cryptocurrency&#8217;s inherent volatility raises concerns about its suitability as a national currency. Argentina, by prioritizing regulation, can pave the way for responsible crypto adoption that complements, rather than disrupts, the existing financial system.</p>
<p>The contrasting strategies of Argentina and El Salvador present a fascinating case study for the future of cryptocurrency in Latin America. While El Salvador has grabbed headlines with its pioneering move, Argentina&#8217;s measured approach could ultimately prove more successful in harnessing the potential of digital assets within a stable economic framework. Only time will tell which strategy will lead to long-term economic benefits.</p>

<title>Crypto Analyst Predicts Parabolic Surge For Cardano, What’s The Driver?</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/parabolic-surge-for-cardano/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/parabolic-surge-for-cardano/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章指出，Cardano的本地加密货币ADA可能会在未来出现价格上涨。分析师Dan Gambardello预测ADA将突破当前低迷的表现，并预测其对比特币的价格将增长10倍。其他分析师也认为ADA将在2025年前达到先前的历史高点，并预计在牛市中价格会突破5美元。目前ADA价格下跌了8.69%，但如果分析正确，加密货币价格可能会增长1000%。 <div>
<p class="p2"><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-founder-predictions-2030/">Cardano has been quite muted</a> over the last few weeks and then finally succumbing to the market crash that begun on Monday. However, the prospects are not completely bleak for Cardano’s native cryptocurrency ADA, as one crypto analyst has predicted that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-1800-price-explosion-12/">the coin is ready to surge</a>.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Cardano On The Cusp Of A Massive Price Surge</h2>
<p class="p2">Crypto analyst and Cardano bull, Dan Gambardello, has predicted more upside for ADA going forward. The analyst used the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-analyst-sets-5-target-for-cardano-price-how/">ADA-BTC</a> chart for the analysis, which showed that Cardano has been performing poorly compared to Bitcoin lately. However, this poor performance might be short-lived as the analyst expects <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-founder-fud-hydra-scaling-partnerships/">ADA</a> to break out from it.</p>

<p class="p2">In the post that was made on X (formerly Twitter), Gambardello points to the performance of Cardano in the last bull market right before the halving. The analyst explains that the cryptocurrency had actually performed similarly and was the underdog while other coins had rallied. But once ADA started to pick up steam, it would go on to rally to a new all-time high.</p>
<p class="p2">“Just like last cycle as we head into Bitcoin halving and parabolic altcoin season, Cardano is an underdog,” the crypto analyst stated. “Even though I’ve been talking about this non-stop, people are once again sleeping on this chart.”</p>
<p class="p2">Gambardello’s chart outlines a target for Cardano against Bitcoin, which shows an almost 10x run from its current levels. It maps out a move from 0.000008 BTC to as high as 0.00008 BTC, a 1,000% increase to bring it back to its all-time high.</p>

<p></p>
<h2 class="p2">When ADA Price Will Reach Previous All-Time High</h2>
<p class="p2">Gambardello is not the only one who believes that the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-analyst-sets-5-target-for-cardano-price-how/">Cardano price</a> is headed back to its previous all-time highs, especially as the bull market is around the corner. A <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano/panel-of-experts-reveal-when-the-cardano-price-will-reach-3/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Finder’s panel recently revealed their predictions for the coin</a> and when they believe its price will reach above $3 once again.</p>

<p class="p2">The panelists agreed that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-1800-price-explosion-12/">ADA</a> would see a surge in price by 2025 that will bring it as high as this level. As Nick Ranger, the senior crypto and forex analyst at ForexTraders, said, Bitcoin’s rally following the halving will see Cardano follow the same path.</p>
<p class="p2">Presently, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-analyst-sets-5-target-for-cardano-price-how/">Cardano is trading at $0.59</a> after an 8.69% decline in the last week. However, if Gambardello’s analysis proves correct, then the price of the cryptocurrency could cross the $5 mark in the bull market. This would mean a 1000% or a 10x on any investments made at the current price level.</p>

<title>Crypto Status Is The US SEC’s Primary Target, Not XRP: Bill Morgan</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/secs-primary-target-is-crypto-status-not-xrp/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/secs-primary-target-is-crypto-status-not-xrp/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要: 这些信息是积极的。<br />澳大利亚律师Bill Morgan指出，美国证券交易委员会（SEC）主要关注加密货币的法律地位，而不仅仅是XRP。SEC认为数字资产是证券，因此可能将加密货币列入监管范围。XRP和比特币可能不受风险，但其他加密货币可能会受到影响。即使法官裁定XRP不是证券，SEC仍坚持XRP在公开交易所出售构成证券，并希望通过这场诉讼明确加密货币的监管地位。对于加密货币市场而言，这一案件意义重大，因为可能会揭示SEC对加密货币分类和监管地位的看法。人们期待4月23日的大审判可能解决诉讼问题。 <div>
<p>Australia-based attorney Bill Morgan has <a href="https://x.com/Belisarius2020/status/1775187876382470612?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">revealed</a> that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s (SEC) main target is crypto&#8217;s regulatory status in the ongoing legal dispute and not exclusively XRP.</p>
<h2>US SEC Target&#8217;s Findings On Crypto Status</h2>
<p>For a long time, the SEC has maintained that it has the authority to regulate digital assets because they are securities, just like stocks and bonds, which could be the reason why Morgan believes the SEC is majorly targeting all cryptos.</p>

<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bill-morgan-refutes-xrp-listing-on-coinbase/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bill Morgan</a> previously highlighted all cryptos are at risk except XRP and Bitcoin due to certain of the SEC&#8217;s claims made in the Coinbase case, which the judge deemed plausible enough to allow the lawsuit to proceed.</p>
<p>Drawing attention to the SEC&#8217;s interlocutory appeal of last year, Morgan stated that he forewarned a second portion of the statement that XRP was computer code with no inherent value. Since he believes the SEC would make allegations that cryptocurrencies are not like commodities.</p>
<p>As a result, an X user questioned that given that the SEC already declared that they would not appeal the decision that XRP is not a security, can they now make a change and file an appeal? Furthermore, the user asked if Ripple has any grounds for an appeal if the SEC decides to alter their minds later on. </p>
<p>Responding to the user, the Australian lawyer stated that his point is that the regulatory watchdog does not have to appeal the decision that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-used-bots-manipulate-xrp-price/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">XRP</a> is not a security.</p>
<p>Rather, the court&#8217;s determination that cryptos themselves might not be securities and are only computer code with no intrinsic value, but any sale of crypto on the primary or secondary markets must be an investment contract is where the Commission hopes this battle will end. </p>
<p>This is because, after all, no one would purchase an asset if they did not anticipate making money off of someone else&#8217;s labor. Therefore, this suggests the agency might be primarily focusing on the regulatory status of every crypto asset and not mainly on XRP.</p>
<p>On July 13, 2023, Judge <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-judge-deems-xrp-sale-non-investment-contract/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Analisa Torres</a> of the Southern District of New York ruled that XRP by itself is not a security. Despite the judge&#8217;s ruling on the digital asset&#8217;s status, the SEC is still strong-willed that XRP sales on public exchanges constitute securities.</p>
<h2>Impact Of The Lawsuit On Cryptocurrencies</h2>
<p>For more than three years, Ripple and the US regulatory watchdog, SEC, have been embroiled in litigation. The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-vs-sec-climax-briefing-deadlines/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">SEC v. Ripple</a> case is significant for the cryptocurrency market since it may provide transparency on the SEC&#8217;s classification of cryptos and their regulatory status.</p>

<p>Some hope that the conclusion of the legal battle might bring about the anticipated shift in the SEC&#8217;s approach to the cryptocurrency landscape. Nonetheless, the community is currently looking forward to the grand trial on April 23, which might lead to the resolution of the lawsuit.</p>

<title>Crypto Crash? Not So Fast, Says Bitcoin Believer Michael Saylor</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-crash-not-so-fast-says-michael-saylor/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-crash-not-so-fast-says-michael-saylor/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章讨论了比特币即将到来的减半事件，由于市场波动，比特币价格下跌。然而，Michael Saylor等明显的人物仍然相信比特币的长期潜力。他强调了比特币作为数字资产的重要性，并认为ETF将推动机构采用。减半事件将减少比特币的供应，增加稀缺性，可能推高价格。尽管市场不稳定，但长期来看，比特币前景仍看好。 <div>
<p>With less than three weeks until the highly anticipated Bitcoin halving, the crypto market is facing a period of turbulence. Bitcoin (BTC), the world&#8217;s leading digital asset, has shed over 12% of its value in the past week,<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> dipping below $66,000</a> for the first time since late March. This downturn comes amidst broader market anxieties, raising questions about the short-term future of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>Despite the current chills, prominent figures like Michael Saylor, founder of MicroStrategy and a vocal Bitcoin advocate, are urging investors to look towards the long term.</p>
<p>The crypto industry has taken notice of Saylor&#8217;s comments, in which he reiterates his belief in Bitcoin&#8217;s long-term potential despite the present market volatility. Saylor has been an enthusiast of Bitcoin for a long time.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Bet on the Future. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">#Bitcoin</a> <a href="https://t.co/04nOjLoaWn" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/04nOjLoaWn</a></p>
<p>— Michael Saylor<img alt="⚡" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/26a1.png" style="height: 1em;" /> (@saylor) <a href="https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1775132438575944161?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">April 2, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<h2><strong>Reframing Bitcoin As Digital Property</strong></h2>
<p>Saylor recently emphasized the potential of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etf-alert-analyst-issues-major-warning/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds</a> (ETFs) to usher in a new era of institutional adoption, potentially driving up prices in the future.</p>
<p>He believes that a deeper comprehension of the nature and primary objective of Bitcoin is necessary. &#8220;It&#8217;s an unfortunate historical artefact that people refer to it as currency or digital currency. It&#8217;s not a digital money. Saylor clarified, &#8220;It&#8217;s digital property,&#8221; in an early March interview with CNBC.</p>
<h2><strong>The Halving Event: A Supply Squeeze</strong></h2>
<p>Scheduled for around April 20, the upcoming halving event is a pivotal moment in Bitcoin&#8217;s history. This pre-programmed mechanism will cut the block reward for miners, those who validate Bitcoin transactions, by half. Currently, miners receive 6.25 BTC per block; post-halving, this will fall to 3.125 BTC.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/Mhjm2xBb/" width="2475" /></p>

<p>The significance lies in Bitcoin&#8217;s capped supply of 21 million coins. With fewer new coins entering circulation due to the halving, scarcity is expected to intensify. Historically, such events have coincided with <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-analyst-sees-100k-before-halving/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">price surges</a> as demand for the limited supply of crypto outpaces the reduced influx.</p>
<strong>Crypto Scarcity Vs. Volatility: A Balancing Act</strong>













<p>While the halving event holds promise for bolstering Bitcoin prices in theory, the prevailing market downturn introduces a layer of uncertainty into the equation. Despite the optimistic outlook surrounding halving events historically, crypto experts caution that the bullish momentum may be tempered by broader economic conditions.</p>

<p>Factors such as escalating interest rates and the looming specter of a global recession cast shadows over investor sentiment, potentially prolonging the downward trajectory of Bitcoin&#8217;s price. As market participants grapple with the confluence of these factors, the extent of the halving&#8217;s impact remains uncertain, highlighting the intricate interplay between macroeconomic trends and the cryptocurrency market.</p>













<strong>Beyond The Halving: A Look At The Long Game</strong>
<p>The long-term outlook for Bitcoin hinges not just on the halving but also on factors like regulation and mainstream adoption. Regulatory clarity from governments could be a game-changer, fostering trust and encouraging institutional investment. Additionally, the integration of Bitcoin into traditional financial instruments like ETFs, as Saylor suggests, could significantly broaden its appeal.</p>

<title>Analyst Says Shiba Inu Will Flip Dogecoin As SHIB Burn Rate Expodes</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-flip-dogecoin-shib/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-flip-dogecoin-shib/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章涵盖了加密货币分析师Altcoin Sherpa关于Shiba Inu（SHIB）和Dogecoin（DOGE）之间的竞争以及SHIB的增长势头的看法。SHIB在基础面方面表现强劲，具有Shibarium实用性，并持续进行SHIB代币销毁。尽管不太可能再次获得20倍投资回报率，但SHIB在本牛市中仍有望取得合理收益。分析师认为SHIB将至少超过其历史最高价0.00008845美元。 <div>
<p>Crypto analyst Altcoin Sherpa recently mentioned that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-dogecoin-shib-excitement/">Shiba Inu (SHIB) could still flip</a> Dogecoin (DOGE) as the largest meme coin by market cap. His statement comes at a time when SHIB’s fundamentals are showing strength, with the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-burns-bright-shib/">token’s burn rate</a> increasing significantly in the last 24 hours. </p>
<h2>Shiba Inu To Have “Some Moments” Where It Flips Dogecoin</h2>
<p>Altcoin Sherpa suggested in an X (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/AltcoinSherpa/status/1774507879589965959?s=20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> that the competition between DOGE and SHIB will be well heated up in <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bull-market-glassnode/">this cycle</a> as there will be “some moments” where the latter flips the former. DOGE and SHIB are the foremost meme coins and rank as the eighth and twelfth largest crypto tokens by market cap, respectively. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, the crypto analyst noted that SHIB has “some stuff going on” in terms of its fundamentals and highlighted the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inus-shibarium-hits-new-record-amid-chaotic-market-movements/">layer-2 network Shibarium</a> as one of those things. <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shibarium-public/">Since launching</a>, Shibarium has undoubtedly <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-burns-bright-shib/">contributed to SHIB’s growth</a> and has helped position it as more than just a meme coin.  </p>
<p>This is why SHIB also seems to have an edge over DOGE. It possesses a real-life utility in Shibarium, unlike DOGE, which someone like Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-ceo-speak-world-economic-forum-wef/">once criticized</a> as providing no real value. Additionally, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-lead-dev-ethereum/#:~:text=Years%20In%20Prison-,Shiba%20Inu%20Lead%20Dev%20Tells%20Ethereum%20Founder%2C%20&#039;It&#039;s,Just%20The%20Start&#039;%2C%20Here&#039;s%20Why&amp;text=Shiba%20Inu%20(SHIB)%20lead%20developer,from%20the%20SHIB%20ecosystem%20soon.">Shiba Inu’s team</a> has been actively building and continues to develop initiatives that help increase SHIB’s value.</p>
<p>One of these initiatives involves regularly burning SHIB tokens. Impressively, the team has even committed some of the transaction fees earned on the Shibarium network to also burning SHIB. It is also worth mentioning that SHIB’s burn rate has picked up recently, with the <a href="https://www.shibburn.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">burn tracking website Shibburn</a> reporting an 89% increase in the last seven days. </p>
<p>The burn rate in the last 24 hours is even more impressive. During this period, there was a 4000% increase, with over 154 million SHIB tokens being burned. </p>
<h2>What To Expect As A Shiba Inu Investor</h2>
<p>While listing the cons of Shiba Inu, Altcoin Sherpa stated that those just <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-surge-crypto-shib/#:~:text=Shiba%20Inu%20To%20See%20A%20300%25%20Gain%20Before%20Year%2Dend&amp;text=Looking%20at%20SHIB&#039;s%20chart%2C%20the,invest%20in%20the%20crypto%20token.">investing in the meme coin</a> now are unlikely to see as much as a 20 times return on their investment. This suggests that it is almost impossible for SHIB to enjoy such <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/122000-surge-shiba-inu-price/">historic gains</a> as the one it recorded in the last bull run. </p>

<p>Despite that, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-23-5-million-shiba-inu/">SHIB</a> is still expected to make reasonable gains in this bull run, with Altcoin Sherpa admitting that the SHIB chart “still looks amazing.” However, he urged <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-active-addresses-soar-over-170/">investors</a> to be patient as this move might not come instantly. </p>
<p>As to how high SHIB could rise in this market cycle, crypto analysts like Xanrox and Javon Marks <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-surge-crypto-shib/#:~:text=Shiba%20Inu%20To%20See%20A%20300%25%20Gain%20Before%20Year%2Dend&amp;text=Looking%20at%20SHIB&#039;s%20chart%2C%20the,invest%20in%20the%20crypto%20token.">have predicted</a> that the meme coin would at least surpass its all-time high (ATH) of $0.00008845.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at around $0.00002712, down in the last 24 hours, according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/shiba-inu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">data</a> from CoinMarketCap. </p>

<title>Cardano Approached By Several US States For Blockchain Voting</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-us-blockchain-voting/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-us-blockchain-voting/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。美国一些州正考虑利用Cardano基金会的区块链技术来开发选举系统。CEO Frederik Gregaard确认了接触，并强调政府机构越来越感兴趣利用区块链来增强选举过程的透明度和问责制。Cardano基金会在区块链技术方面的经验为探索大规模应用提供了坚实基础。然而，将区块链技术应用于州级选举将面临一系列挑战，包括选民身份验证等问题。如果成功应用，区块链将带来更高的安全性，可靠性和透明度，比传统邮寄选举系统更具优势。ADA当前交易价格为0.59美元。 <div>
<p>The Cardano Foundation has been approached by several US states interested in developing a blockchain-based voting system. This information came to light during a recent <a href="https://cexplorer.io/article/us-states-turn-to-cardano-foundation-for-secure-and-transparent-voting-solutions" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">interview</a> with Frederik Gregaard, CEO of the Cardano Foundation, conducted by DailyCoin.</p>
<h2>US States Consider Cardano For Election Security</h2>
<p>Gregaard confirmed the engagement, highlighting the growing interest of governmental bodies in leveraging blockchain to enhance electoral processes. The interest from these states focuses on creating a &#8220;lightweight&#8221; blockchain solution aimed at increasing transparency and accountability in voting systems.</p>
<p>While Gregaard expressed enthusiasm about the inquiries, he also noted the challenges involved, particularly regarding the timeframe requested by the states for implementing such a solution.</p>
<p>Gregaard stated, “We have been approached by a couple of states in the US, saying, &#8216;hey can you help us to do a light-weight blockchain solution to make it more transparent and accountable how we are voting?&#8217;. I still have to look at it if we can make this happen in the time frame they&#8217;re looking at.”</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p></p>
<p>Notably, Gregaard&#8217;s mention of these developments did not come with extensive details on the discussions or the specific requirements of the states. This lack of detail makes it difficult to assess the feasibility of deploying such a system in the near future.</p>

<p>However, the Cardano Foundation&#8217;s existing experience with the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-project-catalyst-unveils-50m-ada-funding/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Catalyst voting system</a>—where ADA holders participate in project proposals and decisions—provides a solid foundation for exploring larger-scale applications in governmental voting processes.</p>
<p>This system has facilitated numerous funding rounds, contributing to the ecosystem&#8217;s growth and demonstrating the potential for blockchain in facilitating transparent and inclusive voting mechanisms. However, applying blockchain technology to state elections introduces complexities beyond those encountered in Catalyst, especially concerning voter identity verification.</p>
<p>The Cardano Foundation is in the process of developing a solution that includes a<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/coinbase-backed-centre-deploys-identity-solution/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> decentralized identity (DID)</a>, but this system is not yet complete. Successfully adapting blockchain for state-wide elections will require addressing these and other challenges to ensure a system that is secure, reliable, and capable of handling the scale of public elections.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the potential <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/midterm-elections-oppose-blockchain/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">benefits of blockchain voting</a> are significant, promising greater security, reliability, and transparency than traditional postal voting systems, which are vulnerable to fraud and errors. Blockchain could assure voters that their votes are accurately counted, reduce the risk of lost votes, enhance voter anonymity, and protect against manipulation.</p>
<p>Overall, the specifics of the discussions between the Cardano Foundation and the interested US states remain undisclosed, including which states have approached the foundation. It is also questionable if other blockchain projects like Ethereum or Solana have been approached by the unknown US states.</p>
<p>At press time, ADA traded at $0.59.</p>

<title>Nearly $430 Million Lost In 24 Hours As Bitcoin Drops Below $66,000</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-plunge-nearly-430-m-lost-in-24-hours/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-plunge-nearly-430-m-lost-in-24-hours/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。比特币经历了一周的暴跌，导致超过4500美元的损失和支撑水平破裂。这引发了交易平台上427亿美元的大规模清算，并且选项市场和零售交易所的活动表明了下跌的端倪。长头寸遭受重创，表明加密货币市场存在风险和波动性。比特币价格略有回升，但投资者信心受到动摇。接下来几周将决定比特币是暂时的挫折还是更持久性的调整。 <div>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC), the flagship cryptocurrency, endured a brutal week, shedding over $4,500 and<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> tumbling below the crucial $67,000</a> support level. This sudden price reversal triggered a cascade of liquidations across trading platforms, with a staggering $427 million vanishing within a 24-hour period, according to data from CoinGlass.</p>

<p>Analysts are scrambling to pinpoint the exact cause of the downturn, but clues from the options market and activity on retail exchanges offer some insights.</p>
<h2>Options Market Foreshadowed Downturn</h2>
<p><a href="https://t.me/QCPbroadcast/1182" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">QCP Capital,</a> a crypto-focused trading firm, believes the options market served as the initial spark for the downward spiral. Their analysis, released earlier this week, revealed a downside skew in risk reversals, a subtle indicator within the options market that often precedes price drops. This suggests that some options traders anticipated a potential decline and positioned themselves accordingly.</p>
<h2>Retail Frenzy Fuels Volatility</h2>
<p>The dramatic descent was further amplified by<a href="https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> substantial liquidations</a> on retail-oriented exchanges like Binance. Perpetual funding rates, which gauge market sentiment on leverage, witnessed a dramatic shift.</p>

<p>Rates plummeted from a lofty 77%, indicating strong bullish sentiment with leveraged positions heavily skewed towards price increases, to flat territory within a short timeframe. This rapid unwinding of leverage positions exacerbated price volatility, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy as falling prices triggered further margin calls and forced selling.</p>
Long Positions Crushed
<p>The brunt of the liquidations fell on long positions, representing bets that the price would rise. A staggering $342 million of the total liquidations came from these bullish positions. Bitcoin itself became the epicenter of the storm, with over $130 million in long positions forcibly liquidated on the flagship cryptocurrency.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/YcJipbzN/" width="2475" /></p>

A Stark Reminder of Crypto&#8217;s Risks
<p>This episode serves as a stark reminder of the inherent risks and volatility that plague the cryptocurrency market. When prices plummet unexpectedly, traders employing leverage are forced to offload their holdings at a loss to meet margin requirements. This fire sale mentality can further accelerate price declines, creating a vicious cycle.</p>

The Road Ahead For Bitcoin
<p>While Bitcoin has recovered slightly since the initial plunge, hovering around the $66,500 mark, the recent turmoil has undoubtedly shaken investor confidence.</p>
<p>The coming weeks will be crucial in determining whether this is a temporary setback or the start of a more sustained correction for Bitcoin. Whether bulls can regain control or bears continue to dictate the market remains to be seen.</p>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。Steven Nerayoff声称几个严重的指控，包括在以太坊内部存在欺诈行为，涉及ICO欺诈、知识产权和发明被盗以及与腐败美国官员勾结等。同时，他暗示中国共产党对以太坊有影响，并指称以太坊基金会与Gatecoin黑客事件有关。这些指控尚未得到实质性证据的证明，但会在明天揭晓。 <div>
<p>Steven Nerayoff, a former advisor to Ethereum and now better known als “ETH insider or whistleblower”, has taken to X (formerly Twitter) to announce that the long wait for his potentially massive revelations is finally over tomorrow. Nerayoff, who has been at the center of various controversies and legal battles, made a dramatic statement on X, suggesting the unveiling of information that could potentially alter the public&#8217;s perception of the ETH ecosystem and its founders.</p>
<p>Nerayoff stated, &#8220;THE TIME HAS COME FOR THE EARTH-SHATTERING REVELATIONS OF FORMERLY UNTOUCHABLE POWERS: [&#8230;] The most powerful forces on the planet sought to suppress us by maliciously targeting me, thinking it would silence us all. Despite their extreme power and vast resources, we emerged victorious [&#8230;] The world is about to learn what we&#8217;ve pieced together starting tomorrow. Get ready: The perception of yesterday will be drastically altered. The world as we know it is about to change.”</p>

<p></p>
<h2>The Ethereum Insider’s Big Reveal: What To Expect</h2>
<p>Nerayoff has made several serious allegations against Vitalik Buterin, Joe Lubin, and the Ethereum Foundation, painting a complex picture of supposed misconduct and fraud within the ETH ecosystem. These allegations span various aspects of Ethereum&#8217;s development and operations, including fraudulent ICOs, personal misconduct, and collusion with corrupt officials.</p>

<p><strong>Misconduct and Fraud Allegations:</strong> Nerayoff accuses Buterin and Lubin of orchestrating a wide-ranging fraud within Ethereum, alleging their involvement in issuing fraudulent ICOs to fleece investors. He claims this activity was the main business model for Lubin&#8217;s company, ConsenSys, early on. Nerayoff asserts that the fraudulent activities surrounding ETH are <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-insider-founders-fraud/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">far more significant than those in the FTX case</a>, referring to Ethereum as &#8220;the fraudulent elephant in the room.&#8221;​</p>
<p><strong>Intellectual Property and Inventions Theft:</strong> Nerayoff claims that Buterin copied his ideas, including the concept of issuing utility tokens via ICOs. He argues that Buterin has not contributed any significant inventions to the network and attributes the network&#8217;s failure to scale to Buterin&#8217;s actions​​.</p>
<p><strong>Accusations of Collusion with US Officials:</strong> Furthermore, Nerayoff alleges that Buterin and Lubin <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-insider-gensler-covert-eth-involvement/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">colluded</a> with corrupt US government officials, including SEC Chairman Gary Gensler and former SEC Chairperson Jay Clayton. He implies that these relationships aka “ETH Gate” gave ETH an unfair advantage in the crypto space​.</p>

<p><strong>Character Assassination and Reputation Damage:</strong> Nerayoff also accuses Buterin and his father of attempting to ruin his reputation by falsely accusing him of extorting an Ethereum ICO. This claim extends to suggesting that ETH&#8217;s founders have previously tried to frame him​ ​.</p>
<p><strong>CCP Involvement:</strong> According to Nerayoff, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) holds a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-insider-china-eth-jeopardize-crypto/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">substantial stake</a> in Ethereum, which he and TruthLabs claim jeopardizes the entire cryptocurrency world. TruthLabs suggest that Chinese entities close to the CCP control nearly 80% of mined ETH, raising alarms about the potential for centralized control over the Ethereum network.</p>
<p><strong>Ethereum Foundation&#8217;s Connection to the Gatecoin Hack: </strong>TruthLabs and Steven Nerayoff have presented <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-buterin-silent-pressure-gatecoin-hack/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">evidence</a> suggesting the Ethereum Foundation&#8217;s connection to the 2016 Gatecoin hack, where 185,000 ETH were stolen. This investigation highlighted transactions from the foundation to wallets directly involved in the hack, raising serious questions about the Foundation&#8217;s role and motivations during this period.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that these allegations are part of an ongoing dispute and have not been substantiated with concrete evidence in the public domain thus far. The situation is complex, with Nerayoff positioning himself as a whistleblower intent on exposing what he perceives as deep-rooted issues within the Ethereum ecosystem. Tomorrow the world will find out what Nerayoff can really prove.</p>
<p>At press time, ETH traded at $3,309.</p>

<title>Paradigm Sets Ambitious Goal: Plans To Raise Up To $850M For New Crypto Venture Capital Fund</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/paradigm-plans-to-raise-up-to-850m-for-crypto-fund/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/paradigm-plans-to-raise-up-to-850m-for-crypto-fund/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的<br />风险投资者正在抓住加密货币市场最近再次复苏的机会，争相筹集新资金。据悉，以US为主题的加密货币公司Paradigm正在与投资者讨论，为其最新基金筹集约7.5亿至8.5亿美元。此举旨在超过10亿美元的目标，显示出风投资本在加密领域的新一轮乐观情绪。其他公司如Hivemind Capital也在积极筹集专门基金，凸显了风投社区对加密行业日益增长的兴趣和信心。 <div>
<p>Venture capitalists are capitalizing on the recent resurgence of the cryptocurrency market as they rush to raise new funds. Paradigm, a crypto-focused firm co-founded by Fred Ehrsam, the co-founder of US-based crypto exchange <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/paradigm-industry-titans-rallying-behind-coinbase/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Coinbase</a>, and Matt Huang, a former partner at Sequoia Capital, is reportedly in discussions with investors to secure between $750 million and $850 million for its latest fund. </p>
<p>According to a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-02/crypto-vc-paradigm-in-talks-to-raise-over-750-million-for-fund" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">report </a>on the issue, if successful, this financing round would be the largest in the industry since the market crash.</p>
<h2>Paradigm Aims To Surpass $1 Billion Target</h2>
<p>The crypto venture capital landscape experienced a significant setback following a steep downturn in digital asset prices after May 2022. However, Paradigm aims to leverage the current market recovery and investor confidence to raise substantial capital for its new fund. </p>
<p>In 2021, Paradigm raised a record-breaking $2.5 billion fund, which was the largest-ever <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/paradigm-amicus-accuses-sec-of-regulatory-overreach/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">crypto investment vehicle</a> at the time. In September, reports emerged that Paradigm was targeting a $1 billion fundraise. The current discussions indicate that Paradigm is seeking to surpass that goal.</p>

<p>Last year was an eventful one for Paradigm. Per the report, the company faced criticism over the summer when it temporarily removed references to cryptocurrency from its website, raising concerns about its commitment to the industry. However, it quickly rectified the situation by reinstating the crypto-focused content. </p>
<p>In October, Fred Ehrsam moved from managing partner to general partner at the firm. In addition, Matt Huang testified at the trial of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sam-bankman-fried-could-face-110-years-in-prison/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Sam Bankman-Fried</a>, the co-founder of FTX, a crypto exchange in which Paradigm had invested $278 million. Huang stated that Paradigm was unaware of fraudulent practices at FTX and subsequently wrote down its investment to zero.</p>
<p>Despite these setbacks, the report notes that Paradigm has remained active in supporting crypto projects. The firm recently led an investment round in Merkle Manufactory, a company responsible for developing the<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/paradigm-challenges-secs-bittrex-with-amicus-brief/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> software infrastructure</a> for the Farcaster social media network. </p>
<p>This funding round reportedly valued Merkle Manufactory at approximately $1 billion, indicating Paradigm&#8217;s continued belief in the potential of the crypto industry.</p>
<h2>Venture Firms Flock To Crypto</h2>
<p>According to Bloomberg, Paradigm is not alone in seeking to raise funds within the crypto space. Other venture firms, such as Hivemind Capital, are actively raising specialized funds, such as a $50 million <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/is-bitcoin-better-than-gold/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">non-fungible token</a> (NFT) fund. </p>
<p>Hack VC, which announced a $150 million fund in February, is also looking to raise at least $100 million for another investment vehicle. These efforts highlight the growing interest and confidence within the venture capital community towards the crypto industry.</p>

<p>Overall, Paradigm&#8217;s ongoing discussions to raise between $750 million and $850 million for a new fund underscore the renewed optimism in the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dubai-welcomes-crypto-exchange-deribit-with-license/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">crypto market</a>. With the industry recovering from the previous downturn, venture capitalists are eager to capitalize on the opportunities presented by the resurgent market. </p>

<title>Crypto Optimism Prevails: Bitcoin’s Buy Signals Surge Despite Ongoing Market Dip</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-optimism-prevails-bitcoin-buy-signals-surge/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。最近比特币价格下跌，但分析显示投资者对市场有信心，并且积极预期市场会迅速回升。社交媒体对买入和多头情绪充满乐观。比特币ETF交易量在三月份增加至1110亿美元，但四月份出现下降迹象。尽管出现市场回调，仍然有超过120亿美元的净流入，显示对比特币的持续兴趣。 <div>
<p>Amid a recent downturn in the overall cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin has seen a notable retracement, shedding nearly 10% of its value over the past week. This decline has extended further in the past 24 hours, with Bitcoin&#8217;s price currently hovering around $65,353.</p>
<p>Despite this market correction, sentiment among crypto enthusiasts remains surprisingly optimistic. Crypto analytics platform Santiment <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1775034934702510319?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">highlighted</a> the prevailing confidence in the market, noting that while crypto prices have retraced, investors have a significant level of confidence regarding a potential quick recovery.</p>

<h2>Crypto Optimism Prevails</h2>
<p>Concerning optimism, Santiment&#8217;s analysis revealed trends in social media conversations reveal a notable prevalence of positive terms related to buying and bullish sentiment, such as #buy, #buying, #bought, and #bullish, compared to negative terms like #sell, #selling, #sold, or #bearish.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><img alt="📉" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/1f4c9.png" style="height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#Bitcoin</a> has seen a drop to $66.4K, and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/altcoins?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#altcoins</a> have shed much more of their market caps as prices have continued their concerning retracement to kick off April.

<p>In the past, such occurrences have often indicated possibilities for purchasing assets within the cryptocurrency market. When the general sentiment tends towards apprehension of further decline, it typically leads to smaller investors offloading their assets, which are then acquired by larger entities.</p>
<p>This pattern suggests that many investors perceive the current market downturn as a chance to buy rather than a<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-short-sellers-bet-against-crypto-stock/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> cause for alarm</a>.</p>
<img alt="Bitcoin (BTC) price chart on TradingView" class="size-medium" height="1496" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/wm0g9R5S/" width="2770" />
<h2>Bitcoin ETFs And Market Dynamics</h2>
<p>In parallel with the market retracement, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have seen significant activity. Analyst Eric Balchunas has recently reported that spot Bitcoin ETFs traded at approximately $111 billion in March, tripling their volumes from the previous two months.</p>
<p>While Balchunas remains cautious about expecting even <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/argentina-milei-first-mistake-bitcoin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">greater volumes</a> in April, he doesn&#8217;t discount the possibility entirely. However, following the surge in spot ETF trading volumes last month, so far this month, spot <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/is-bitcoin-better-than-gold/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin</a> ETF purchases have shown signs of waning, contributing to the current market downturn.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">MARCH MADNESS: Bitcoin ETFs traded $111b in March, which is just about triple what they did in Feb and Jan.

<p>Recent <a href="https://x.com/BitMEXResearch/status/1775115543923524029?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">data</a> indicates that combined US spot Bitcoin ETFs experienced net outflows on Monday, marking a shift from the net inflows recorded throughout the previous week. Notably, Grayscale&#8217;s converted GBTC fund saw significant outflows, totaling $302.6 million, outweighing the $165.9 million inflows into BlackRock&#8217;s IBIT ETF.</p>

<p>Fidelity&#8217;s FBTC and Invesco&#8217;s BTCO also saw inflows, while Ark Invest 21Shares&#8217;s ARKB ETF experienced its first outflows since trading began. Despite<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-screams-huge-opportunity-gold-high/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> these fluctuations</a>, total net inflows for spot Bitcoin ETFs remain above $12 billion, reflecting continued interest in the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-bulls-take-365-million-beating-bitcoin-crash/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">cryptocurrency market</a> despite recent setbacks.</p>

<title>Crypto Trading Gone Wrong: Trio Of Teens Arrested In Hong Kong For Beating A 19-Year-Old</title>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。最近香港发生了一起由青少年参与的加密货币交易会议，导致一名19岁男孩被殴打。参与者要求他支付23,000美元的利润，最终导致两名攻击者用棒球棍袭击受害者。这种暴力事件引发了对年轻人兴趣可能带来危害的讨论。该文提到，尽管一些年轻人利用加密货币获得了财富，但也存在一些消极案例，例如16岁少年涉嫌参与Solana稳定币Cashio的黑客攻击。然而，年轻人对加密货币和DeFi技术的广泛接受也为数字金融领域带来了新的活力。 <div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Hong Kong has recently been in the news due to crypto regulatory developments or the buzz around the possibility of spotting Bitcoin or Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETF) launch in the coming months.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On this occasion, the digital asset’s hub made the headlines after a crypto trading meeting between teenagers ended with the police’s involvement and a hospital visit.</p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto Enthusiasm Turns Violent</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">According to The South China Morning Post (SCMP), a 19-year-old was rescued after allegedly being assaulted over profits obtained from crypto trading. As a result, three teenagers were arrested by Hong Kong’s police after allegedly beating the boy in a hotel room in the early hours of today.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A group of teenagers aged between 16 and 19 had scheduled a meeting in a room at Harbour Grand Kowloon Hotel in the Hung Hom area. The teenagers seemingly organized the reunion to meet people and trade crypto together.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The victim, whose identity was not revealed, was allegedly detained and physically assaulted by the other nine people in the room. Per the <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3257544/hong-kong-police-arrest-3-teens-rescue-19-year-old-allegedly-beaten-baseball-bat-and-detained-hotel?campaign=3257544&amp;module=perpetual_scroll_0&amp;pgtype=article" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">report</a>, the attackers demanded that the victim pay HK$180,000, approximately $23,000, in profits earned from crypto trading.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">After threatening and blackmailing the victim, two teenagers from the group attacked the 19-year-old boy with baseball bats. A friend of the victim called the police after being contacted.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">After learning of the police involvement, most of the suspects fled the scene. However, the police were able to detain one of the aggressors inside the room and the other two outside the hotel.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A source told the SCMP that the room where the incident occurred had previously been used as a spot for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/thailands-crypto-becomes-vat-free-are-the-details/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">crypto trading</a>. Detectives from the Kowloon City anti-triad is handling the case.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">At the time of the report, the authorities continued to look for the other six teenagers, four males and two females.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It is worth noting that it’s unclear whether the demanded profits were gained during the meeting or if the victim was allured to the hotel room to be threatened and extorted.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Is Younger People’s Interest A Recipe For Disaster?</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As previously <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/the-alarming-web3-beyond-the-solana-hack/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">reported</a>, a 16-year-old teenager was suspected to be responsible for the hack that plummeted the Solana-based stablecoin Cashio. The attacker was allegedly involved in several rug pulls at the time. During this incident, the hacker exploited approximately $28 million.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Other cases where young crypto enthusiasts have made the headlines are not absent as the younger generations’ adoption increases.  Nonetheless, the reasons behind the news are not always negative.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Generation Z (Gen Z) is emerging at the forefront of the crypto community. Younger people have started to take on leading and important developing roles, as Vitalik Buterin <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/vitalik-buterin-celebrates-birthday-childhood-over/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">noted</a> in his birthday post.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A study by Bitget <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/gen-z-leading-crypto-copy-trading/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">revealed</a> that Gen Z leads the pack regarding copy and social trading. Moreover, reports show that the newest generation of investors “are a growing force of digitally savvy stakeholders” who have <a href="https://www.finrafoundation.org/sites/finrafoundation/files/Gen-Z-and-Investing.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">adopted</a> crypto as their most common investment.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Cryptocurrencies and the underlying technology offer accessibility and financial freedom to those who use them. Undoubtedly, the younger generation of investors is embracing the benefits of crypto and decentralized finances (DeFi).</p>

<title>Whales Buy Up 5% Of Stablecoin Supply, What Are They Up To?</title>

<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/whales-buy-up-5-stablecoin-supply-what-they-up-to/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />近三周来，数据显示鲸鱼实体已经购买了主要稳定币供应的约5%。这表明大额持有人最近一直在积极地积累稳定币供应。这可能意味着新资本正在涌入市场，或者鲸鱼正在从比特币等波动性较高的资产中卖出以寻求稳定的美元挂钩币。这种稳定币的供应增加可能意味着大量的潜在资金积累在一旁等待部署，尤其是对比特币等资产来说。<br />Bitcoin's recent sharp price drop to $65,200 does not negate the positive implications of the accumulation of stablecoins by whale entities. <div>
<p>On-chain data suggests the whale entities have bought up around 5% of the supply of the major stablecoins over the past three weeks.</p>
<h2>Whales Have Been Gobbling Up Stablecoin Supply Recently</h2>
<p>According to data from the on-chain analytics firm <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1774964885534945770" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Santiment</a>, whales have been rapidly accumulating the stablecoin supply recently. Whales here refer to investors holding at least $5 million in cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>The chart below shows the trend in the supply of the major stablecoins held by these large holders over the past few months.</p>
<p><img alt="Stablecoin Whales" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="1723" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GKHwKxcbAAA73M7?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096" width="2560" /></p>

<p>The &#8220;major&#8221; stablecoins here include Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC), BUSD (BUSD), Dai (DAI), TrueUSD (TUSD), and Pax Dollar (USDP). The chart shows that the percentage of the supply of these stables held by the whale entities has shot up recently.</p>
<p>This would suggest that these large holders have accumulated more of these fiat-tied tokens. In the same chart, Santiment has also attached the data for the total stablecoin market cap, and it appears that this metric has also been rising in the same period.</p>
<p>However, the growth in the whale holdings has been notably sharper, implying that the newly minted tokens of these assets wouldn&#8217;t be the only source behind the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/stablecoin-shark-whales-strong-accumulation-bitcoin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">accumulation</a>.</p>
<p>In total, the whales have added more than 5% of the combined supply of these major stablecoins to their wallets over the past three weeks, which is impressive.</p>
<p>What does this accumulation from the whales mean for the wider cryptocurrency sector? There are generally two reasons why the whales&#8217; holdings might grow.</p>
<p>First, there could be some fresh big money coming into the market that is choosing to enter through stablecoins. Second, whales are selling coins from the volatile side of the sector (like Bitcoin) to seek safety in these dollar-pegged coins.</p>
<p>The former is always bullish for the sector, suggesting the inflow of new capital. The latter, though, can be bearish initially. Usually, however, investors who choose to invest in stablecoins do so because they eventually plan to enter (or re-enter) the volatile side.</p>

<p>Thus, the supply of stablecoins, especially that held by the whales, may be seen as capital sitting on the sidelines, waiting to be deployed. As such, the sharp increase in whale holdings recently would imply that there could be a large amount of potential <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dai-shark-whale-holdings-grow-dry-powder-bitcoin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">dry powder</a> amassed for Bitcoin and others currently.</p>
<p>In reply to a user under this X post, Santiment has also noted that the Bitcoin accumulation from the whales has been quite strong recently. This implies that a bullish combination has been developing since the stablecoin rise wasn&#8217;t simply due to the whales reshuffling capital from BTC to stables but from actual capital inflows.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>Bitcoin has registered a sharp plunge over the past day, taking its price to the $65,200 level.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/shiba-inu-shib-slumps-as-whale-sell-off-dampens-momentum-details/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">The price of Shiba Inu</a> has been predicted to experience a major increase amidst the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-bull-run-2024-inevitable/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">2024 bull market</a> that has propelled various meme coins to new all-time highs. This <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-turns-bullish-crypto/">forecast</a> puts the spotlight on the doggy-themed cryptocurrency, highlighting a potential for more increases in its price value.</p>
<h2>SHIB Expected To Rise In April</h2>
<p>Machine learning algorithm, PricePredictions has <a href="https://pricepredictions.com/forecast/shiba-inu" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">made</a> a bullish price forecast for Shiba Inu’s native token, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-takes-over-the-internet-google-searches-climb-as-global-interest-surges/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">SHIB</a>. According to the Artificial Intelligence (AI) platform, SHIB is currently displaying long-term<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-climbs-to-second-spot-in-crypto-searches-as-shib-rallies/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> bullish signals</a> and could see its price potentially surging to $0.00003 by April 20, 2024. </p>

<p>Sharing a chart of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-price-mirrors-2021/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Shiba Inu’s historical price movements</a>, PricePredictions disclosed that SHIB is currently struggling at resistance levels of $0.00003. The cryptocurrency recently experienced a significant decline of 6.99% over the past week. However, despite the price drop, SHIB is anticipated to undergo a short-term <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/all/shiba-inu-shib-5-rally-reversal-confirmed/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">price recovery</a> as traders take advantage of the dip as a buying opportunity. </p>
<p>Using price indicator tools like Moving Weighted Averages (MWA), and Bollinger Bands (BB), PricePredictions analyzes a cryptocurrency’s price momentum over the years, leveraging <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/historical-trends-unveil-bitcoin-peak-timing-in-current-bull-cycle/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">historical trends to predict the cryptocurrency’s future value</a>. The platform employs advanced machine learning algorithms to generate market forecasts and price predictions of cryptocurrencies. </p>
<p>Despite the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-surge-crypto-shib/">promising future outlook of Shiba Inu</a>, indicated by its relatively steady upward trajectory over the past few months, it’s important to recognize the inherent difficulty in accurately predicting <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-rare-bullish-signal-price-target/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">future prices of cryptocurrencies</a>. Nevertheless, technical analysis from AI platforms like PricePrediction can offer insights into a cryptocurrency’s price movements and current performance. </p>
<h2>Shiba Inu Price Update</h2>
<p>Recently, the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shib-will-lose-place-to-pepe-in-new-bull-cycle-analyst-makes-the-case/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">price of SHIB</a> has been displaying bearish trends, experiencing a 6.18% decline in the past 24 hours and a 7.52% drop over the past seven days. The cryptocurrency has <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-dips-below-0-00003-again-can-bulls-reverse-the-bullish-momentum/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">failed to hold key support levels at $0.00003</a>, plummeting to a price of $0.000027, at the time of writing. </p>

<p>According to its price chart from CoinMarketCap, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/press-releases/unveiling-the-future-why-shiba-inus-latest-move-signals-a-broader-market-shift/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Shiba Inu</a> is currently showing red candles and may continue downward if it does not undergo a price reversal. Including SHIB, other <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/meme-coins/meme-coins-next-trojan-horse/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">meme coins</a> have been on a bearish trajectory recently.</p>
<p>Popular meme coins like <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogwifhat-wif-flips-pepe-as-the-3rd-largest-memecoin-after-hitting-4/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Pepe (PEPE)</a> have witnessed a price drop of more than 10% in the past 24 hours. While the price of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/traders-not-dogecoin-fomo-good-sign-rally/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dogecoin (DOGE)</a> is trading at $0.18, reflecting a price decrease of about 9.3% in just a day.</p>
<p>These bearish prices may indicate the present market sentiment surrounding meme coins, suggesting a cautious outlook among investors.</p>

<title>Bitcoin ETF Issuer VanEck Dives Into Stablecoin Market, Must-Know Facts Revealed</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etf-issuer-vaneck-dives-stablecoin-market/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etf-issuer-vaneck-dives-stablecoin-market/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章介绍了VanEck家族在稳定币市场的投资，他们通过启动创业公司Agora进入稳定币领域。Agora的稳定币将由现金、美国国债和隔夜回购协议支持，旨在填补市场需求空缺。此外，文章还介绍了比特币ETF交易量激增至1110亿美元，反映出对加密投资产品的增加需求。种种迹象表明，加密货币市场正处于蓬勃发展的阶段。 <div>
<p>In a move highlighting the growing interest in the stablecoin market, Nick Van Eck, son of investment management veteran Jan Van Eck, is making a significant bet on cryptocurrencies through the family business. </p>
<p>Agora, a startup co-founded by spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) manager firm VanEck, along with crypto veterans Drake Evans and Joe McGrady, recently raised $12 million in a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/vaneck-expands-offerings-unveils-nft-marketplace/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">seed funding round</a> to launch its USD stablecoin.</p>
<h2>VanEck-Backed Agora Enters Stablecoin Space</h2>
<p>According to a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-02/van-eck-scion-launches-stablecoin-with-investment-firm-s-support" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, Agora&#8217;s stablecoin will be backed by cash, US Treasury bills, and overnight repurchase agreements. It will be managed by VanEck, according to Kyle DaCruz, director of digital assets products at VanEck.</p>
<p>DaCruz emphasized the importance of having audited and transparent stablecoin reserves to ensure transparency and trustworthiness. Agora plans to build this future by partnering with crypto companies, including <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/lack-of-disclosure-costs-vaneck-almost-2-million/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">exchanges</a>, custodians, decentralized applications (dApps), and trading firms, rather than directly targeting customers in different regions.</p>

<p>While Tether currently dominates the stablecoin sector, with a market value of around $104 billion, and USDC issued by Circle holds about $32 billion, VanEck believes there is still room for a newcomer. </p>
<p>Per the report, Agora aims to fill this gap by focusing on regions such as Argentina and Southeast Asia, where <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etf-grayscale-spin-off-vaneck-slashes-fees/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">stablecoins </a>have significantly impacted.</p>
<p>Notably, Agora&#8217;s stablecoin will only be available to users outside the United States due to the country&#8217;s lack of federal legislation governing stablecoins. VanEck highlighted the importance of regulatory clarity and intended to serve international customers primarily until such legislation is in place.</p>
<p>Agora plans to establish income-sharing contracts with its partners, offering them benefits while individual holders of Agora won&#8217;t receive direct yield or income. VanEck also expressed concerns about some projects in the stablecoin sector, particularly in light of the TerraUSD blowup, and emphasized the need to build a company that positively advances the industry.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin ETF Trading Volume Skyrockets To $111 Billion</h2>
<p>In a significant increase in interest in the newly approved investment vehicles, spot Bitcoin ETFs traded $111 billion in March, nearly tripling February&#8217;s total of $42.2 billion.</p>
<p>Bloomberg ETF expert Eric Balchunas took to social media site X (formerly Twitter) and <a href="https://x.com/EricBalchunas/status/1775147839498207695?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">highlighted </a>the significance of this milestone, underlining the substantial growth in trading volume by stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bitcoin ETFs traded $111 billion in March, which is just about triple what they did in February and January. I can&#8217;t imagine April will be bigger, but who knows.</p></blockquote>
<img alt="VanEck " class="size-large wp-image-291481" height="660" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GKKXG48XQAE5Elk.png?w=980&#038;resize=980%2C660" width="980" />
<p>Among the spot ETFs available, those issued by <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etf-by-vaneck-benefit-btc-core-developers/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Grayscale </a>(GBTC), BlackRock (IBIT), and Fidelity (FBTC) continued to dominate trading volume, as seen in the chart above shared by Eric Balchunas. However, Grayscale&#8217;s GBTC fund has experienced total outflows of more than $15 billion since it began trading in January.</p>

<p>The significant growth in spot Bitcoin ETF trading volume reflects the increasing demand for crypto investment products. As more investors seek exposure to the digital asset market through regulated and easily accessible vehicles, ETFs have gained traction as a popular option. </p>
<img alt="VanEck " class="size-large" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/Ov2BLXRD/" width="1815" />
<p>At present, the largest cryptocurrency in the market, BTC, is being traded at $65,200, reflecting a significant decline of over 4% within the past 24 hours.</p>

<title>Singapore Steps Up Crypto Regulation: MAS Implements Stricter Guidelines For Service Providers</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/singapore-steps-up-crypto-regulation-mas-implements/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/singapore-steps-up-crypto-regulation-mas-implements/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。新加坡货币管理局对付款服务法案进行了修订，扩大了监管框架，包括加强针对加密货币公司的监管措施，包括数字支付令牌（DPT）的保管服务和传输 facilitation. 新的指导方针涉及用户保护要求，包括外部资金活动并执行反洗钱和打击恐怖主义融资规定。此外，新规定同时强调用户保护措施，如资金隔离，记录保留和安全协议，以确保数字资产交易的安全和透明。最近有关监管措施的发展表明新加坡正在努力创造一个安全和透明的数字资产交易环境。 <div>
<p>Singapore&#8217;s Monetary Authority has <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/news/media-releases/2024/mas-expands-scope-of-regulated-payment-services" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">introduced</a> amendments to the Payment Services Act, signaling a widening regulatory framework. These changes, which will take effect in phases from April 4, mark a significant shift in the landscape for companies operating in the crypto sector.</p>
<h2>Guidelines For Consumer Protection</h2>
<p>The amendments encompass a range of measures, covering custodial services for digital payment tokens (DPTs), transmission facilitation of DPTs, and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/partnership-will-allow-crypto-payments-in-singapore/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">cross-border money transfers</a>.</p>

<p>Notably, the regulations extend to activities involving funds from outside Singapore. This expanded regulatory purview &#8220;empowers&#8221; the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to impose stringent requirements on DPT service providers, signaling a &#8220;proactive&#8221; approach to mitigating risks associated with digital assets, according to the report. MAS  noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>The amendments will empower MAS to impose requirements relating to anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism, user protection and financial stability on DPT service providers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Simultaneously, the MAS has issued <a href="https://www.mas.gov.sg/regulation/guidelines/ps-g03-guidelines-on-consumer-protection-measures-by-dpt-service-providers" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">guidelines</a> outlining consumer protection requirements for DPT services entities. These guidelines are slated to come into effect on October 4.</p>
<p>Among the stipulated measures are the segregation of customer funds, meticulous record-keeping practices, and &#8220;robust security protocols to shield customers&#8217; assets from potential threats.</p>
<p>While Singapore&#8217;s crypto regulatory landscape has evolved, recent developments underscore the authorities&#8217; effort to create a &#8220;secure and transparent&#8221; environment for digital asset transactions.</p>
<p>Notably, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/singapore-crypto-trading-restrictions-now-in-effect/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">regulatory updates</a> coincide with broader efforts to fortify the country&#8217;s position as a fintech hub, balancing innovation with risk management to safeguard investor interests and uphold financial integrity.</p>
<h2>Singapore&#8217;s Approach to Crypto Regulation</h2>
<p>Singapore&#8217;s stance on digital currency regulation reflects a balancing act between supporting innovation and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etfs-face-regulatory-roadblock-in-singapore/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">managing risks</a>. While the country has actively appealed to crypto firms to establish a presence within its borders, regulatory scrutiny has intensified with the sector&#8217;s growth.</p>
<p>For example, Singapore <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/okx-approved-a-win-for-singapores-crypto-ambitions/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">granted an in-principle approval to the global crypto exchange OKX</a> for a Major Payment Institution (MPI) license. The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-exchange-obtains-principle-license-singapore/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">European crypto exchange Bitstamp also made headlines</a> by announcing its receipt of an In-Principle Approval (IPA) license in Singapore.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Big news! <img alt="📰" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4f0.png" style="height: 1em;" /> Bitstamp is the first crypto exchange with major EU presence with In-Principle License Approval in Singapore. <img alt="🇸🇬" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f1f8-1f1ec.png" style="height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>We&#8217;re paving the way for globally regulated crypto exchanges in Singapore and the APAC region.</p>
<p>More info: <a href="https://t.co/WdefHJiZXU" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://t.co/WdefHJiZXU</a> <a href="https://t.co/4D1NuU9PJW" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/4D1NuU9PJW</a></p>
<p>— Bitstamp (@Bitstamp) <a href="https://twitter.com/Bitstamp/status/1765323127381241900?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">March 6, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>As reported by Bitcoinist, this move sends a clear message that Singapore is open for crypto business, but only for those who play by the rules.</p>

<p>Recent initiatives, such as the proposed enhancements to user protection requirements and restrictions on <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/singapore-crypto-trading-restrictions-now-in-effect/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">retail speculation</a>, underscore Singapore&#8217;s effort to crypto governance.</p>

<title>Crypto Expert Says Now Is The Time To Get Into Dogecoin, Here’s Why</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/time-to-get-into-dogecoin/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/time-to-get-into-dogecoin/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章指出现在是投资者在DOGE中定位自己的最佳时机，因为专家预测该硬币将在未来几天出现价格的激增。文章提到了Elon Musk可能会再次将X的标志更改为DOGE图标，类似于去年DOGE价格大涨的情况。分析师们相信DOGE有望在本市场周期内上涨至1美元，而Musk的行动可能是导致这种价格攀升的关键。同时，DOGE被接受的渠道也在不断扩大，这将极大地提振DOGE的市场。 <div>
<p><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-price-mirrors-2021/#:~:text=Crypto%20Expert%20Predicts%20Massive%20Shiba%20Inu%20Run%20As%20Price%20Mirrors%202021,-by%20Scott%20Matherson&amp;text=Crypto%20expert%20Rekt%20Capital%20has,ATH)%20and%20even%20surpass%20it." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Crypto analyst Crypto Kaleo</a> recently suggested that now was the best time for investors to position themselves in <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-pundit-predicts-price-surge-for-dogecoin/#:~:text=Crypto%20Pundit%20Predicts%20Massive%20Price%20Surge%20For%20Dogecoin%20%E2%80%93%20Here&#039;s%20The%20Target&amp;text=Crypto%20analyst%20DonAlt%20has%20provided,from%20its%20current%20price%20levels.">Dogecoin (DOGE)</a>. This came following his statement, which hinted at a price surge for the foremost meme coin in the coming days. </p>
<h2>Why Now Might Be A Good Time To Invest In DOGE</h2>
<p>In an X (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/CryptoKaleo/status/1774886054916415542?s=20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, Kaleo reminded the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-community-doge-day/">crypto community</a> of how the world’s richest man and X owner, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-tesla-ceo-elon-musk/">Elon Musk</a>, changed the X logo to Dogecoin a couple of days after April 1 last year. The crypto expert further revealed that he had already positioned himself just in case Musk does it again this time around. </p>
<p>Last year, Dogecoin&#8217;S price jumped by over 30% after <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/elon-musk-incorporates-dogecoin-symbol/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Musk replaced X’s logo</a> with the Shiba Inu dog (which happens to be DOGE’s logo). As such, Kaleo expects the meme coin to enjoy a similar price gain if Musk makes such a move again. Such a move will also provide a much-needed relief for Dogecoin, which has steadily declined since rising to as high as $0.22 last week. </p>
<p>However, investors positioning themselves for such a move must be cautious, considering how short-lived the ‘Musk-triggered’ pump has been in the past. Moreover, even if Musk were to change the X logo to the DOGE icon, such a move is expected to be temporary, with DOGE’s price likely to drop once the original logo is reinstated. </p>
<p>The same thing happened last year as <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-plunges-8-as-twitter-drops-doge-icon/">DOGE’s price plunged sharply</a> following X’s removal of the Dogecoin icon and reversal to its original logo. Meanwhile, in response to Kaleo’s post, his followers deliberated on the possibility of Musk changing the X logo to the DOGE icon again. Some <a href="https://x.com/gr3ggr1ff1n/status/1774927947691962635?s=20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">argued</a> that it was unlikely, especially with the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/breaking-sec-lawsuit-elon-musk-twitter-purchase/">SEC’s lawsuit</a> against Musk.</p>
<h2>Musk Will Pump Dogecoin To $1</h2>
<p>Following Kaleo’s post, one X user (Shitcoin Alchemist), who boasts over 35,000 followers on the platform, <a href="https://x.com/TearOfSatoshi/status/1774897265804464404?s=20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">stated</a> that Elon Musk will pump DOGE to $1. Optimism about DOGE rising to $1 in this market cycle continues to grow, with analysts <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-pundit-predicts-price-surge-for-dogecoin/#:~:text=Crypto%20Pundit%20Predicts%20Massive%20Price%20Surge%20For%20Dogecoin%20%E2%80%93%20Here&#039;s%20The%20Target&amp;text=Crypto%20analyst%20DonAlt%20has%20provided,from%20its%20current%20price%20levels.">predicting</a> it is possible. However, if Musk is to contribute to this parabolic rise, it will be through his actions rather than words. </p>

<p>Musk seems aware of this fact, as he <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/elon-musk-tesla-dogecoin/#:~:text=While%20addressing%20employees%20at%20the,meme%20coin%2C%20stating%2C%20%E2%80%9CDogecoin">recently mentioned</a> that Tesla (which he founded) will eventually begin to accept DOGE payments. Bitcoinist also <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/elon-musk-tesla-dogecoin-payments/">reported </a>that the Tesla Supercharging Station in Hollywood will accept Dogecoin payments once it launches. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, although Musk and X remain silent about the social media platform integrating DOGE into its <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/x-dogecoin-payments-included/">payment service</a>, it no doubt remains a possibility and something that will significantly boost the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-doge-path-to-0-2/#:~:text=The%20Dogecoin%20adoption%20trend%20has,added%20in%20a%20single%20week." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">meme coin’s adoption</a>.  </p>

<title>Bitcoin Falls: Why Is This Analyst Expecting A Strong Bounce To $80,000?</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-falls-analyst-strong-bounce-to-80000/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-falls-analyst-strong-bounce-to-80000/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。本文提到，比特币在技术分析中形成了一个看涨的平段形态，可能突破并推动价格达到80,000美元。虽然目前价格下跌，但一位乐观的分析师指出，如果买家入场并拒绝当前的新低，比特币可能会突破最近的历史高位，并冲向新的高点。然而，目前卖方仍在控制着价格，并在交易所中的表现指示出卖方的控制已经加强。比特币处于一个看涨的平段形态，购买者目前只能等待，对目前的走势保持乐观。 <div>
<p>Bitcoin remains under pressure when writing on April 2. However, one optimistic analyst points to a potential breakout above a formation that could propel the price to $80,000. </p>
<h2>Will Bitcoin Breakout Higher From The Pennant?</h2>
<p>Despite the current dip, the analyst <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/CryptoJelleNL/status/1775136771900158045" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">notes</a> that technical analysis of the daily chart has printed a bullish pennant formation. If buyers step in, rejecting the current lower lows, the coin may surge above recent all-time highs and soar to new territories.</p>
<img alt="BTC in a pennant | Source: Analyst on X" class="size-full wp-image-291462" height="704" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GKKNfCaW4AAMeV1.jpg?resize=1024%2C704" width="1024" />
<p>Bitcoin is within a bullish pattern from an effort-versus-result perspective in the daily chart. The coin is down 5% in the past 24 hours and 7% in the last week of trading. Trading at around the $66,000 level, the coin is down 11% from all-time highs and under pressure. </p>

<p>Bitcoin is trading below the middle BB at spot rates, a technical indicator for gauging volatility. The breakout means sellers are in control, at least in the short term. At this pace, sellers will likely continue to press on, pushing the coin towards crucial support levels.</p>
<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/x/NM88PHCg/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Bitcoin price trending upwards on the daily chart | Source: BTCUSDT on Binance, TradingView" class="size-full" height="904" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/NM88PHCg/" width="1787" /></a>
<p>Though the analyst is upbeat, BTC might find support at the March 20 lows of around $61,500. Further losses could trigger a sell-off, possibly towards $59,000 or lower.</p>
<p>Still, as the analyst notes, Bitcoin is within a bullish pennant formation. The pattern forms when prices consolidate after periods of strong higher highs, as has recently. From late January 2024, BTC has rallied nearly 90%, surging from around $39,800 to peaking at all-time highs of about $73,800. After this rally, prices moved sideways and continued to be within this consolidation, forming the pennant.</p>
<h2>It&#8217;s A Waiting Game For BTC Bulls</h2>
<p>For now, traders can only wait. However, what&#8217;s evident is that sellers are squarely in control despite the optimism. As mentioned, a bear breakout below the pennant could catalyze more losses toward $60,000. Conversely, rejecting lower lows cements the analyst&#8217;s outlook, providing a ground for higher highs towards $73,800.</p>

<p>Bitcoin supporters are buoyant, even with current losses. As the coin corrects after surging in the better part of Q1 2024, potential catalysts for even more gains in the weeks ahead include the highly anticipated <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoins-mining-milestone-difficulty-soars-to-record-levels-amid-halving-anticipation/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">halving</a> event. Assuming the current demand continues, slashing emission rates by 50% might see prices edge higher.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Price ‘Screams Huge Opportunity’ As Gold Records Historic High</title>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。<br />黄金价格连续三天创下历史新高，达到2266.85美元。与此同时，比特币等加密货币领域被认为将迎来重大收益。宏观经济指标显示美元贬值，美联储预计实施政策宽松。一位名为Ted的加密货币专家表示，短期波动意味着巨大机会，金价上涨与美元贬值、通货膨胀等因素密切相关，也推动了比特币。他建议投资者对比特币的长期价值前景保持耐心，将其视为对抗货币贬值的替代选择。 Stack Hodler也认为，比特币作为一种不可被贬值的有限资产，应该被视为长期投资，并强调了其重要性。BTC目前交易价格为65729美元。 <div>
<p>This Tuesday, the price of gold ascended to a new zenith, reaching $2,266.85, marking the third consecutive day of record highs. The precious metal started the day trading just under $2,250, but surged to set a new record, slightly above its previous day&#8217;s peak. Amidst this surge in gold prices, the cryptocurrency sector, particularly Bitcoin, is perceived to be on the brink of significant gains.</p>
<h2>Gold Up, Bitcoin Down = Huge Opportunity</h2>
<p>Ted, a prominent figure in the crypto domain known on Twitter as @tedtalksmacro, shared his insights through Talkingmacro. He shed light on the present volatility seen in the crypto markets, interpreting these fluctuations not merely as instability but as a beacon of opportunity.</p>
<p>Ted <a href="https://twitter.com/talkingmacro_/status/1775128984852091289" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">articulated</a>, &#8220;Short-term volatility = Opportunity. Amidst this move lower in crypto, I&#8217;m anchoring my view around the macro picture into year-end&#8230; it screams HUGE opportunity.&#8221; His perspective is deeply rooted in the broader economic indicators, specifically pointing out the continuous debasement of the US dollar, which has notably favored the ascent of gold and, by extension, suggests a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-breaks-70000-barrier-investors-speculate-on-100000-target-for-2024/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">bullish forecast for BTC</a>.</p>
<img alt="Bitcoin vs gold" class="size-full wp-image-291453" height="724" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GKKBeFea8AAEWB1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C724" width="1024" />
<p>&#8220;The narrative is very, very strong for gold and therefore BTC,&#8221; Ted explains, attributing gold&#8217;s ascendance to the weakening dollar, diminishing yields, and escalating inflation—all factors compounded by accelerated fiscal spending and anticipated policy easing by the Federal Reserve. This confluence of factors not only bolsters gold&#8217;s appeal but also strengthens the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/gold-out-bitcoin-in-etf-investors-flock-to-btc/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">case for Bitcoin</a> as its digital counterpart in this new financial era.</p>

<p>Highlighting the inherent correlation between gold and Bitcoin, Ted underscores, &#8220;A correlation that I&#8217;ve long pointed to&#8230; I believe BTC will catch back up to gold in due course.&#8221; Despite the apparent divergence in the performance of these two assets, he attributes it to temporary market dynamics like trader positioning, which he believes is particularly affecting Bitcoin at present.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the foundational reasons for both assets to surge—lower yields, higher inflation, and for Bitcoin specifically, the upcoming halving event and the inflows into the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-beats-okx-and-kraken-holdings/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">spot ETFs</a>—remain robust.</p>
<p>Addressing recent market movements, Ted cautioned about the excessive optimism among traders towards leveraged long positions at the week&#8217;s start. This over-leverage has since been corrected, leading to a healthier market condition. &#8220;We have OI weighted funding back at baseline levels &#8211; a very healthy development to get ready for the next leg higher,&#8221; he noted, indicating a reset that could pave the way for Bitcoin&#8217;s next growth phase.</p>

<p>The cautious optimism is also tinged with an eye towards upcoming key US employment data, with Ted stating, &#8220;I&#8217;m wary of key employment data out of the US on Friday, however, I&#8217;m expecting the bulls to pick up the pieces here soon.&#8221; This reflects a belief in the resilience of the bullish sentiment towards Bitcoin, supported by a macroeconomic backdrop that favors long-term growth.</p>
Bitcoin Can&#8217;t Be Debased
<p>In a similar vein, Bitcoin advocate Stack Hodler contributed to the discourse on X, highlighting the pivotal shift in investor confidence from US bonds towards assets deemed more secure against inflation, such as gold, equities, real estate, and notably, Bitcoin. He <a href="https://twitter.com/stackhodler/status/1775099188683932146" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">remarked</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Every investor needs to understand this one chart. Gold and US bonds used to move together as conservative store of value assets. But then the US spent itself into a trap and the market called BS on US bonds in 2020. This is a big deal [&#8230;] The market decided that with multi-trillion dollar annual deficits [&#8230;] US bonds will only be paid back in &#8216;printed&#8217; money.</strong></p></blockquote>
<img alt="Gold vs US bonds" class="size-full wp-image-291452" height="749" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GKJmANxXYAA_0Jw.jpg?resize=1024%2C749" width="1024" />
<p>This critique of fiscal policy underlines the growing skepticism towards traditional fiat currencies and debt instruments, positioning Bitcoin as an alternative that offers scarcity and resistance against debasement. &#8220;Bitcoin is finite property that can&#8217;t be debased&#8230; Ignore the day-to-day volatility,&#8221; Stack Hodler advises investors, underscoring the significance of understanding Bitcoin&#8217;s long-term value proposition against the backdrop of fiat currency debasement.</p>
<p>His message is a clarion call for patience and strategic investment in Bitcoin, advocating for a prudent approach that focuses on accumulation over time.</p>
<p>At press time, BTC traded at $65,729.</p>

<title>Is Bitcoin Better Than Gold? Not Everyone Agrees</title>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。文章中指出了金融专家彼得·席夫与罗伯特·基约萨基之间对比比特币和黄金的观点。席夫认为比特币无法与黄金相提并论，指出比特币的价格波动更为剧烈，而黄金则一直稳健增长。另一方面，基约萨基鼓励投资者购买比特币，并对法币持消极态度。尽管两种资产之间存在竞争，比特币价格仍高达66537美元，而黄金价格为2261美元。 <div>
<p>While many financial experts and crypto investors <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-to-surpass-gold-silver/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">believe</a> that Bitcoin could potentially surpass gold as a universal <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-will-beat-gold-as-store-of-value/">store of value</a>, renowned economist and global strategist, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/still-this-high-says-economist-bitcoin-below-39000/">Peter Schiff</a> has consistently contrasted BTC&#8217;s potential with that of gold, asserting that the cryptocurrency pales in comparison. </p>
<h2>Schiff Champions Gold Over Bitcoin</h2>
<p>In a series of X (formerly Twitter) posts, Schiff elaborates on his stance <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/peter-schiff-warns-investors-from-bitcoin-says-they-should-buy-this-instead/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">advocating gold as a better investment alternative to Bitcoin</a>, the world’s largest cryptocurrency. The financial economist also disclosed a notable disparity in the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-outperforms-gold-etfs-drive-market-surge-anticipated-rise-for-polkadots-main-ai-competitor/">price of Bitcoin as compared to Gold</a>. </p>

<p>According to Schiff, BTC recently <a href="https://x.com/peterschiff/status/1775000459851215167?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">experienced</a> a price decrease of more than $3,000 in “10 minutes,” indicating a 4.5% decline in its overall price value. He stated that this decrease would be equivalent to a $100 decline in gold within the same time frame. </p>
<p>While highlighting <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-hater-peter-schiff-scoffs-at-rally/">BTC&#8217;s price drop</a>, Schiff revealed that gold was outperforming, demonstrating a modest uptick and poised for further gains. <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-isnt-digital-gold/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">The economist</a> also <a href="https://x.com/peterschiff/status/1774775495583744127?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">emphasized</a> a lack of transparency in platforms like CNBC, alleging that the business channel was a “paid promoter of Bitcoin.”</p>
<p>He revealed that CNBC had “once again” ignored gold’s recent record high, asserting that the network was dedicated to promoting <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/goldman-bitcoin-is-world-best-performing/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">BTC</a>, possibly contributing to its price pump. Moreover, Schiff disclosed that the failure of the Bitcoin to gold ratio to reach an all-time high underscores <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/why-goldman-sachs-expects-this-asset-class-to-outperform-bitcoin/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Bitcoin’s limited potential compared to gold. </a></p>
<p>The renowned economist <a href="https://x.com/peterschiff/status/1774468467917193625?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">argued</a> that Bitcoin’s inability to make a new high in relation to gold undermines its case for being a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cathie-wood-hails-bitcoin-as-digital-gold/">digital gold</a>, potentially hinting that the cryptocurrency is not fit to serve as the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/vaneck-ceo-declares-bitcoin-unbeatable/">ultimate digital store of value</a>. He has consistently lauded gold’s value and potential, <a href="https://x.com/peterschiff/status/1774647068931375612?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">disclosing</a> earlier on April 1 that the precious metal is set for significant returns, potentially catching investors and banks off guard. </p>
<h2>Financial Expert Says Buy More BTC</h2>
<p>While Schiff <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/peter-schiff-advises-bitcoin-holders-to-swap-asset/">dissuades the crypto community members from investing in Bitcoin</a>, Robert Kiyosaki, the author of best best-selling novel ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad,’ has <a href="https://x.com/therealkiyosaki/status/1773568731635200395?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">urged</a> investors and crypto enthusiasts to acquire the valuable digital asset. </p>

<p>In a recent X post, Kiyosaki advised the broader crypto community to purchase real <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/finance-guru-bitcoin-perfect/">Bitcoin</a>, highlighting the lack of value in fiat currencies like the dollar and Chinese Yen. The financial author’s perspective of BTC&#8217;s is a clear contrast to that of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/peter-schiffs-shocking-confession-about-bitcoin/">Schiff, who has constantly criticized the cryptocurrency</a> and undermined its value in relation to gold. </p>
<p>Despite the rivalry between the two valuable assets, Bitcoin’s current price remains high at $66,537, while gold’s price is up at $2,261. </p>

<title>Crypto Bulls Take $365 Million Beating After Bitcoin Crash</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-bulls-take-365-million-beating-bitcoin-crash/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-bulls-take-365-million-beating-bitcoin-crash/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。根据数据显示，加密货币长期持有者在比特币价格跌破66,000美元后，过去一天出现了365万美元的清算。加密货币衍生品市场在今天注册了高额的清算，共计461万美元，其中长期投资者承担了大部分，约80%的清算涉及看涨交易者。此次清算事件主要集中在长方向，被称为“长挤空”。比特币和以太坊导致了大部分清算，市场的价格波动也对清算产生了影响。总体来说，加密货币的衍生品市场存在一定风险，需要谨慎选择交易时机。 <div>
<p>Data shows that cryptocurrency long holders have seen liquidations of $365 million in the past day as Bitcoin&#8217;s price has crashed below $66,000.</p>
<h2>Cryptocurrency Derivative Market Has Registered High Liquidations Today</h2>
<p>According to data from <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">CoinGlass</a>, the derivative side of the cryptocurrency market has suffered some major liquidations in the past day following the volatility that assets like Bitcoin have gone through.</p>
<p>The &#8220;<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/1-billion-crypto-futures-rekt-bitcoin-rollercoaster/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">liquidation</a>&#8221; of a contract takes place when it amasses losses of a certain degree, leading to the derivative exchange with which it&#8217;s open to forcibly close it off.</p>

<p>Below is a table that shows the information about the liquidation event that has occurred in the cryptocurrency sector over the last day:</p>
<p><img alt="Crypto &amp; Bitcoin Liquidations" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-291304 aligncenter" height="300" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/table.png?w=561&#038;resize=561%2C300" width="561" /></p>

<p>As is visible above, the market has observed total liquidations of more than $461 million in the past 24 hours. 144,049 traders were involved in this flush, with the largest single liquidation standing at over $7 million.</p>
<p>It would appear that the long investors have taken the brunt of this liquidation event, with $365 million contracts of this type seeing forceful closure. This would mean that almost 80% of the total liquidations involved these traders betting on a bullish outcome.</p>
<p>The price action in the sector as a whole has been negative in the past day, with Bitcoin witnessing a drawdown of almost 6%. As such, it&#8217;s not surprising to see the liquidations being long-heavy.</p>
<p>Mass liquidation events are popularly known as &#8220;<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-plunge-68000-squeezes-668-crypto-longs/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">squeezes</a>.&#8221; Since the event from the past day has been dominated by the long side of the sector, the squeeze would be categorized as a &#8220;long squeeze.&#8221;</p>
<p>During a squeeze, a sharp swing in the price can result in a large amount of liquidations that only fuel the price move further. This amplified move then causes even more liquidations, and in this way, a cascade of them gets unleashed.</p>
<p>A majority of the latest flushes have come in the past 12 hours alone, as liquidations stand at $310 million for the window. This once again corresponds with the price action, as Bitcoin and others have been the most volatile in this period.</p>
<p>As for how the various individual symbols are responsible for the squeeze, the table below breaks it down:</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Liquidations" class="alignnone wp-image-291312 size-large aligncenter" height="362" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/details.png?w=786&#038;resize=786%2C362" width="786" /></p>

<p>Bitcoin was responsible for the greatest share of liquidations at $137 million, while Ethereum (ETH) came second at $100 million. Out of the altcoins, Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE) have topped the list with about $15 million liquidations each.</p>

<p>In the cryptocurrency sector, mass liquidation events like today&#8217;s aren&#8217;t exactly an uncommon sight, due to the fact that the coins are in general quite volatile and many platforms offer easy access to extreme amounts of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-leverage-ratio-rises-volatile-move-incoming/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">leverage</a>.</p>
<p>Because of these factors, uninformed trading in the derivative side of the cryptocurrency market can prove to be quite risky.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Price</h2>
<p>Bitcoin has plunged all the way towards the $65,200 level with its latest drawdown.</p>

<title>Dubai Welcomes Crypto Derivatives Exchange Deribit With License</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/dubai-welcomes-crypto-exchange-deribit-with-license/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/dubai-welcomes-crypto-exchange-deribit-with-license/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。Deribit获得迪拜虚拟资产监管机构的有条件许可，标志着其在加密衍生品交易领域的重要进展。该许可允许Deribit FZE在迪拜提供现货和衍生品交易服务。Luuk Strijers晋升为CEO，展示了Deribit在行业内寻求增长的努力。该公司将总部迁至迪拜，以利用该地区蓬勃发展的加密生态系统。迪拜成立VARA，吸引了Binance、Bybit和OKX等大公司进驻，并致力于成为全球加密中心。 <div>
<p>Deribit, a powerhouse in the realm of crypto derivatives trading, has achieved a milestone by obtaining a conditional license from Dubai&#8217;s Virtual Asset Regulatory Authority.</p>
<p>This achievement signifies a pivotal advancement in their quest to establish a strong presence within the rapidly <a href="https://insights.deribit.com/exchange-updates/deribit-first-derivatives-exchange-to-receive-vara-regulatory-approval/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">expanding crypto landscape of the Middle East.</a></p>

<p>The timing of this accomplishment aligns with Deribit&#8217;s strategic decision to shift its global headquarters to Dubai, allowing the exchange to tap into the region&#8217;s thriving crypto ecosystem.</p>
<h2>Crypto Exchange Deribit Sets Up Shop In The UAE</h2>
<p>Concurrently, the appointment of Luuk Strijers, previously serving as the Chief Commercial Officer, to the role of CEO further underscores Deribit&#8217;s efforts to charting new avenues of growth within this dynamic industry.</p>
<p>The conditional Virtual Asset Service Provider (VASP) license allows Deribit FZE, the Dubai entity of Deribit Group, to offer both spot and derivatives trading.</p>
<p>However, full operation hinges on Deribit fulfilling specific requirements set by VARA. This conditional nature highlights Dubai&#8217;s commitment to fostering a secure and regulated crypto ecosystem while remaining open to innovation.</p>
<p>In a statement, Luuk Strijers said:</p>
<blockquote>
“VARA’s progressive regulatory framework opens up vast opportunities in the digital asset realm. Our strong position in the crypto options market reflects the trust our clients have in us.”
</blockquote>
<p>While Deribit positions itself as a first-mover in the Dubai derivatives market, the initial focus appears to be on institutional and qualified investors. This strategic choice could be due to stricter regulations surrounding retail participation in Dubai&#8217;s digital currency market. However, Deribit assures continued support for retail investors through its existing Panama-based affiliate.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/s3R7MVkx/" width="2475" /></p>

<p>Deribit&#8217;s move to Dubai is part of a larger trend of major companies seeking a foothold in the region. Dubai&#8217;s establishment of VARA in March 2022, the world&#8217;s first dedicated crypto regulator, has instilled confidence in the market and streamlined regulations.</p>
<h2>Dubai As A Global Crypto Hub</h2>
<p>This, coupled with Dubai&#8217;s ambition to become a global crypto hub, has attracted established players like Binance, Bybit, and OKX. The city&#8217;s upcoming <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/company/dubai-to-host-blockchain-life-forum-2024-navigating-the-current-bull-run/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Blockchain Life Forum</a> in April further underscores its commitment to fostering a vibrant crypto community.</p>

<p>Deribit&#8217;s entry into Dubai presents exciting possibilities for both the company and the region. The license offers Deribit a gateway to a new and potentially lucrative market, while Dubai benefits from the expertise and established user base a prominent crypto player brings.</p>
<p>However, uncertainties remain regarding the specific conditions attached to the license and how Deribit will manage catering to different investor segments under potentially varying regulatory environments.</p>
<p>As Deribit fulfills the remaining requirements and Dubai&#8217;s digital currency regulations continue to take shape, the coming months will be crucial in determining the ultimate success of this strategic move.</p>

<title>Why Is Dogecoin Price Crashing Down Today?</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-price-crashing-down/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-price-crashing-down/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。Dogecoin本周下跌，受比特币价格下跌影响，市场整体呈现负面态势。尽管此前因Elon Musk的影响和Coinbase的相关消息，DOGE价格曾达到新高，但随后市场崩溃导致价格下跌。分析师对未来依然看好，预计DOGE价格可能达到$12。 <div>
<p class="p2">The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-on-chain-metrics-explode/">Dogecoin price</a> is down double-digits today after an eventful week of upward movement. This has seen a good part of its gains eliminated in the last day, pushing the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-community-doge-day/">coin</a> into the red along with the rest of the market.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Why Dogecoin Price Is Down This Week</h2>
<p class="p2">Dogecoin started out Tuesday on a sour note, dropping more than 10% in the 24-hour period as well. This decline is not attributed to a single thing that happened to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-mirrors-2021-12/">DOGE,</a> though, but rather a market-wide decline that began with Bitcoin.</p>

<p class="p2">Following the release of the March manufacturing data in the US, the market responded negatively. The report shows that while manufacturing in the country had actually increased for the first time in two years, there wasn’t an increase in employment at these factories. In addition, prices were also higher, thus triggering a negative reaction.</p>
<p class="p2">The Bitcoin price declined around 5% off this report and as expected, altcoins suffered even more for this. BTC went below $66,000 and is now finding its footing at this level. However, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-whales-fill-up-their-bags-as-price-rallies/">DOGE’s price</a> fell 10% before finding support above $0.18.</p>
<p class="p2">Naturally, Dogecoin is just responding to Bitcoin, which is the market leader. So in this case, an increase in the Bitcoin price would see the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-shiba-inu-ethereum/">DOGE</a> price recover, and a decrease would ensure that the current market crash continues.</p>
<h2 class="p2">DOGE Price Movements This Week</h2>
<p class="p2">Dogecoin had moved around 10% in the prior day to reach a new three-year high above $0.22. The initial <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-whales-fill-up-their-bags-as-price-rallies/">Dogecoin move upward</a> had been triggered by excitement around Elon Musk’s X (formerly Twitter) finally integrating the meme coin as a payment method on the platform.</p>

<p class="p2">The social media company had secured additional money transmitter licenses in the United States, sparking speculation of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-doge-payments-x/">DOGE payments on X coming soon</a>. This, coupled with the expectation that Musk could begin tweeting about <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-community-doge-day/">DOGE</a> once more, saw its price soar higher.</p>
<p class="p2">Also, the announcement that Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the United States, would be launching a perpetual trading contract for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-shiba-inu-ethereum/">DOGE</a> contributed to this upward move. This saw the Dogecoin open interest rise to a new record high of $1.77 billion, signaling high interest in the meme coin.</p>
<p class="p2">Despite the crash in the market, bullish sentiment remains nonetheless, especially around Dogecoin. Crypto Analyst <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-mirrors-2021-12/">Ali Martinez predicts that the Dogecoin price will continue to rise</a>, even putting it as high as $12 as the bull market unfolds.</p>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章探讨了美国批准现货以太坊（ETH）交易所交易基金（ETF）的复杂情况，包括与申请人之间的沟通不畅和以太坊基金会的调查。作者认为拖延可能是好事，因为市场对以太坊ETF的需求可能不如预期，同时以太坊的利息产生机制引起了SEC的注意。Bitwise的Matt Hougan也表示赞同，希望延迟所有ETF批准至12月，以便传统金融部门更好地适应加密货币生态系统。<br /> <div>
<p>The journey towards the approval of a spot Ethereum (ETH) Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) in the United States has taken a complex turn, with developments in recent weeks casting a shadow over its immediate prospects. The anticipation surrounding the potential approval has been met with several setbacks, including a lack in communication between the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and ETF applicants, as well as an ongoing <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-in-the-hot-seat-sec-security-label-looms/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">investigation by the SEC</a> into the Ethereum Foundation regarding the classification of Ethereum as a security.</p>
<p>Following this, Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas recently <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-etfs-approval-odds-drop-to-35/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">adjusted the odds</a> of the ETF&#8217;s approval by May 23, the final deadline for one of the applications, to a mere 25%. This adjustment comes amidst growing skepticism over the immediate future of Ethereum ETFs in the US market.</p>
<h2>Why A Spot Ethereum ETF Is Net Positive</h2>
<p>Contrary to the disappointment typically associated with regulatory delays, Nic Puckrin, the CEO of Coin Bureau, presents an optimistic <a href="https://twitter.com/nicrypto/status/1775066730941030807" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">outlook</a> on the postponement of the Ethereum ETF approval. In a post on X, Puckrin stated, &#8220;In case it wasn&#8217;t obvious, the chances of an ETH ETF by May are pretty low. The Polymarket prediction market has the probability at 19%,&#8221; Puckrin stated, adding, &#8220;But, perhaps this is a good thing?&#8221;</p>

<p>Puckrin&#8217;s commentary delves into the mismatch between market expectations and reality, particularly in the context of the underwhelming reception of Ethereum futures ETFs launched in October last year. This event, he suggests, serves as a precedent, indicating a potential lack of heightened interest in spot products by default.</p>
<p>He argues that a rush towards alternative crypto products following the Bitcoin ETF launch might not be met with the enthusiasm some anticipate. &#8220;The timing just isn&#8217;t right,&#8221; Puckrin elucidated, highlighting the absence of immediate demand from broader TradFi participants for alternative products like Ethereum ETFs.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Puckrin questions the intrinsic appeal of Ethereum ETFs in the absence of yield-generating mechanisms like staking. This aspect of Ethereum&#8217;s utility, while attractive to investors, introduces a layer of complexity in the SEC&#8217;s evaluation process. &#8220;Unless the ETH ETFs will offer yield to the holders, it makes less sense for funds to hold the ETFs vs. investing in ETH spot and staking,&#8221; he observed.</p>
<p>The regulatory scrutiny over Ethereum&#8217;s staking feature is another pivotal aspect of Puckrin&#8217;s argument. He points out that the SEC&#8217;s current interest in classifying ETH as a &#8220;security,&#8221; primarily due to its staking capabilities, poses a substantial risk to the approval process.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s not forget that the whole staking component is why Gary &amp; Co is trying to now <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/house-gop-pressures-sec-to-clarify-ethereum/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">label ETH as a &#8216;security&#8217;</a>,&#8221; Puckrin remarked, highlighting the potential repercussions of such a classification on the broader Ethereum ecosystem and related financial products.</p>
Bitwise Agrees
<p>Echoing Puckrin&#8217;s sentiments, Matt Hougan of Bitwise expressed a preference for a delay in all ETF approvals until December. In an <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/03/31/ethereums-newest-etf-applicant-wants-the-sec-to-delay-approvals-until--december/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">interview</a> with Forbes, Hougan articulated his belief that the market for Ethereum ETFs would be more robust and attractive if given additional time for the TradFi sector to acclimate to Bitcoin and the broader crypto ecosystem.</p>
<p>“I think Ethereum will be very attractive. I think the ether ETFs will be more successful if they launch in 12 months than if they launch in May. I know that sounds goofy, but I think TradFi is still digesting Bitcoin and if you give TradFi time to get comfortable with bitcoin and crypto, they will be ready for the next thing,” Hougan remarked.</p>
<p>A potential delay, as Puckrin notes, could coincide with a burgeoning altcoin season and potentially a change in regulatory leadership at the SEC, setting the stage for a more conducive environment for the introduction and acceptance of Ethereum ETFs.</p>
<p>&#8220;By that time, we could be the full throes of a new Altcoin season with intense demand for alternative ETF products. We could also be in the process of a change of hands at the SEC if you believe the latest polls,&#8221; Puckrin concluded, offering a silver lining to the cloud of delay hanging over the Ethereum ETF prospects.</p>
<p>At press time, ETH traded at $3,344.</p>

<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/china-leverages-blockchain-technology/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />中国宣布了一个旨在加强贸易和经济联系的区块链基础设施项目，旨在为“一带一路”倡议提供支持。该项目由上海树图区块链研究院和中国政府合作推出，将通过Conflux Network主导，旨在建立一个坚固可扩展的基础设施，促进跨境贸易。此举不仅代表了中国利用新兴技术谋求战略优势的重要一步，还突显了区块链技术在促进全球贸易中的巨大潜力。由于区块链技术具有透明度、安全性和效率，它具有改变全球贸易各个方面的能力。通过将区块链技术纳入“一带一路”倡议，中国旨在为自己确立数字经济领导地位并重塑全球贸易动态。 <div>
<p>China has unveiled plans for a blockchain infrastructure project aimed at bolstering trade and economic ties across continents. The initiative, dubbed the &#8220;Ultra-Large Scale Blockchain Infrastructure Platform,&#8221; is poised to play a pivotal role in powering the Belt and Road Initiative, China&#8217;s ambitious global trade network.</p>
<h2>China Taps Blockchain For Its Infra Projects</h2>
<p>Announced through a major partnership between the Shanghai Tree-Graph Blockchain Research Institute and the Chinese government, the project aims to leverage<a href="https://invezz.com/news/2024/04/01/china-taps-conflux-network-for-its-belt-and-road-blockchain-project/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> blockchain technology</a> to establish a robust and scalable infrastructure that will facilitate cross-border trade and commercial expansion. Spearheaded by Conflux Network, a prominent player in the blockchain space, the initiative marks a significant step forward in China&#8217;s efforts to harness emerging technologies for strategic advantage.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>— Conflux Network Official (@Conflux_Network) <a href="https://twitter.com/Conflux_Network/status/1774761161575268415?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">April 1, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>The BRI, often likened to the ancient Silk Road, seeks to create interconnected networks of trade routes, infrastructure projects, and economic corridors spanning Asia, Africa, and Europe. By integrating blockchain technology into this ambitious framework, China aims to revolutionize traditional trade practices and streamline cross-border transactions.</p>

<p>Blockchain technology, known for its transparency, security, and efficiency, holds immense potential to transform various aspects of global trade. With its ability to provide real-time, immutable records of product origins, manufacturing dates, and transportation routes, blockchain promises to enhance supply chain management and build trust among trade partners.</p>
<p>Moreover, by automating payments and contractual obligations through smart contracts, blockchain can simplify cross-border financial transactions, lower transaction costs, and accelerate settlement times.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/pK4NSbVw/" width="2475" /></p>

<h2>Beyond Tech: China&#8217;s Digital Silk Road Ambitions</h2>
<p>The significance of integrating blockchain technology into the BRI extends beyond mere technological innovation. It underscores China&#8217;s strategic vision to establish itself as a leader in the digital economy and reshape global trade dynamics. By leveraging blockchain to enhance connectivity and streamline trade processes, China aims to strengthen its economic influence and promote cooperation among participating nations.</p>
<p>However, China&#8217;s embrace of blockchain technology comes against the backdrop of a regulatory landscape that remains cautious, particularly regarding <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/china-digs-into-cryptocurrency/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">cryptocurrencies.</a> While China has banned cryptocurrency trading and initial coin offerings (ICOs), it has adopted a more nuanced approach to blockchain technology, recognizing its potential to drive innovation and economic growth.</p>

<p>The unveiling of the Ultra-Large Scale Blockchain Infrastructure Platform represents a significant milestone in China&#8217;s blockchain journey and underscores its commitment to leveraging emerging technologies for strategic advantage. As the project moves forward, stakeholders will be closely monitoring its progress and assessing its impact on global trade and economic cooperation.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s bold blockchain initiative for the BRI signals a paradigm shift in the way nations approach international trade and economic development. With blockchain technology poised to play a central role in shaping the future of global commerce, China&#8217;s strategic investment underscores the transformative potential of emerging technologies in reshaping the global economic landscape.</p>

<title>Ethereum Co-Founder Enters The Fray, Delivers Key Remarks On Layer 3</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-co-founder-delivers-key-remarks-on-layer-3/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-co-founder-delivers-key-remarks-on-layer-3/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章讨论了以太坊联合创始人关于Layer 3网络的见解。他指出Layer 3解决方案虽然不能神奇地提高吞吐量，但可以降低一些与存取款和批量发布相关的固定费用。他还提到了他近两年前发布的博文中关于Layer 3的重要观点，强调L3用于专业功能，L2用于扩展。此外，文章还介绍了对Layer 3辩论增长的压力，包括Polygon Labs CEO的看法和Degen生态系统推出的低成本Layer 3区块链Degen Chain。 <div>
<p>Conversations about the Layer 3 networks are currently in the limelight as the well-known Ethereum co-founder <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/vitalik-buterin-celebrates-birthday-childhood-over/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Vitalik Buterin</a> joins the escalating debate in the community, offering key perspectives on the solutions.</p>
<h2>Ethereum Co-Founder On The Layer 3 Solutions</h2>
<p>The Ethereum co-founder offered his key insights on the L3 networks in a recent X <a href="https://x.com/VitalikButerin/status/1775015326419439768?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, noting that the solutions do not miraculously enhance throughput any further, even though they can lower a few fixed expenses related to deposits and withdrawals and batch publishing.</p>

<p>However, he claims there are alternative, possibly lighter techniques to achieve the same cost savings one gets from layer 3s while citing pieces of his previous blog post from nearly two years ago. </p>
<p>The blog post which was dubbed &#8220;What kind of layer 3s make sense?&#8221; outlines the significance of the three distinct layer 3 iterations inside the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-and-ethereum-see-gains-nftfn-predicts-unprecedented-50x-profit/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ethereum</a> ecosystem. The first iteration states that L3s are for specialized functionality, whereas L2s are for scaling.</p>
<p>Instead of aiming for &#8220;scalability squared,&#8221; this strategy consists of a single application-scaling layer in the stack, with additional layers serving the customized functional requirements of various use cases.</p>
<p>For the second version, it states L3 is for customized scaling, while L2 is for general-purpose scaling. Specialized applications that perform their computation via a method other than the EVM or rollups whose data compression is tailored to particular data formats for particular applications are a few examples of how customized scaling might manifest itself.</p>
<p>Lastly, L2 is for no-trust scaling (rollups), whereas L3 is for scaling with a low level of trust (Validiums). These Validiums are systems that depend on a committee or trusted third party to provide the data but utilize SNARKs to validate computation and are highly underrated. This is because a centralized server running a validium prover and constantly committing hashes to the chain might really be the most suitable solution for several enterprise blockchain applications.</p>
<h2>Layer 3 Debate Garnering Pressure</h2>
<p>The Ethereum co-founder&#8217;s overview comes after Polygon Labs Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Marc Boiron offered <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/polygon-ceo-debunks-layer-3-networks/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">a pessimistic perspective on layer 3 solutions</a>. Boiron highlighted that they could jeopardize ETH&#8217;s value and the L2s that form the basis of L3s.</p>

<p>He believes that the Ethereum ecosystem and the crypto space do not significantly benefit from these networks. &#8220;If all L3s settled to one L2, then Ethereum would capture basically no value and, thus, Ethereum security would be at risk,&#8221; he stated.</p>
<p>This heated debate coincides with the introduction of the low-cost Layer 3 blockchain, Degen Chain, by the Degen ecosystem. Created with AnyTrust DA and Arbirtrum Orbit, Degen Chain is a memecoin project on the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/how-will-coinbases-base-network-accommodate-the-web3-gaming-space/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Base network.</a></p>
<p>So far, the project has gained widespread adoption from the community, recording nearly 100,000 active accounts in less than a week. Its transaction volume also witnessed a significant uptick, reaching almost $100 million in 24 hours after its debut.</p>

<title>Argentina’s President Milei Makes His ‘First Mistake’ On Bitcoin</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/argentina-milei-first-mistake-bitcoin/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/argentina-milei-first-mistake-bitcoin/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。阿根廷政府领导人哈维尔·米莱引入了强制性的虚拟资产服务提供商登记制度，这与最初认为的政策背道而驰，并在加密货币爱好者和投资者中引发了批评和担忧。该政策要求涉及各种与加密货币相关的服务的公司和个人完成登记过程。批评者认为这是一次重大倒退，背离了米莱声称的自由主义原则。实施该法规的意图是遵守金融行动特别工作组的建议，但加密社区的反应显示政府的行动与总统米莱所标榜的自由主义价值观存在脱节。 <div>
<p>Argentina&#8217;s government, led by the anarcho-capitalist and libertarian President Javier Milei, has introduced a new regulation that mandates a compulsory Registry of Virtual Asset Service Providers. This decision, announced in late March by the Comisión Nacional de Valores (CNV), contradicts the initially perceived<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/milei-bitcoin-legal-tender-expert-analysis/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> pro-Bitcoin stance</a> of Milei&#8217;s administration and has sparked a wave of criticism and concern among crypto enthusiasts and investors within and beyond Argentina&#8217;s borders.</p>
<h2>Milei Make First Mistake On Bitcoin</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/03/31/argentina-unveiled-mandatory-registry-for-bitcoin-and-crypto-platforms/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">According</a> to Forbes, the CNV&#8217;s new requirement compels companies and individuals involved in various crypto-related services—including buying, selling, sending, receiving, lending, or trading—to complete a registration process.</p>
<p>This policy, approved by the Argentine senate on March 14, extends its reach not only to locally based businesses but also to those operating within the country from abroad. CNV President Roberto E. Silva starkly warned, &#8220;Those who are not registered will not be able to operate in the country,&#8221; underlining the government&#8217;s commitment to this regulation.</p>

<p>Critics argue that this move represents a significant backtrack from the economic freedoms promised by Milei, who took office in December 2023 with a vision to rebuild and dollarize the national economy, potentially boosting Bitcoin and cryptocurrency adoption in Argentina. Manuel Ferrari, a member of an Argentinian NGO and co-founder of the Money On Chain protocol, voiced his discontent in an interview, stating, &#8220;It&#8217;s a terrible idea to have a registry that enables the buying and selling Bitcoin. Bitcoin is money, not a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-in-the-hot-seat-sec-security-label-looms/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">security</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ferrari&#8217;s remarks echo a broader sentiment that this regulation is not only unnecessary but detrimental, benefiting &#8220;state bureaucrats and an army of lawyers and useless people from the &#8216;compliance industry'&#8221; while diverging from Milei&#8217;s supposed libertarian principles.</p>
<p>Nicolas Bourbon, co-founder of the KamiPay payments solution, offered a nuanced perspective, suggesting that while Milei might not explicitly <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-advisor-plans-argentina-milei/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">support Bitcoin,</a> he respects currency freedom and the regulation is not aimed at users but rather at satisfying international institutions&#8217; demands.</p>

<p>The regulation has not only faced domestic backlash but also international criticism. Bitcoin maximalist Max Keiser expressed his disappointment via X (formerly Twitter), accusing Milei of failing to comprehend Bitcoin&#8217;s essence and predicting negative repercussions. &#8220;Javier Milei makes his first major mistake. He never took the time to understand Bitcoin, now he’ll suffer the consequences,&#8221; he <a href="https://twitter.com/maxkeiser/status/1774878972079149249" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">stated</a>.</p>
<p>Similarly, an Argentine Bitcoin user, known as Neo (@21Millones_BTC), lamented the practical implications of the new policy, revealing that custodial apps like Bela and Strike have already restricted Bitcoin transfers, a move that contradicts the ethos of freedom associated with cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>&#8220;Milei turned out to be a fluke, fake weak libertarian after all. I used to pay contractors in Argentina in Bitcoin via Lightning until a few months ago. Now since this new “libertarian” government is in office, all custodial apps ceased to allow transfers using BTC, including Belo, Strike and many others. So much about FREEDOM. Don’t trust politicians, kill all your f**ing heroes,&#8221; he <a href="https://twitter.com/21Millones_BTC/status/1774906039764217952" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">remarked</a>.</p>
<p>Argentina ranks 15th in the Chainalysis&#8217; Global Crypto Adoption Index Top 20, highlighting its significance in the global cryptocurrency market. The introduction of this regulatory framework marks a critical juncture for the country&#8217;s crypto landscape, with future implications that remain uncertain. While the CNV&#8217;s initiative aims to align with the Financial Action Task Force&#8217;s recommendations, the immediate reaction from the crypto community suggests a disconnect between the government&#8217;s actions and the libertarian values purportedly endorsed by President Milei.</p>
<p>At press time, BTC traded at $66,964.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：
这些信息是积极的。Floki是一种受欢迎的模因币，在与Binance Pay的整合后获得了主流关注。这整合使得超过1200万活跃用户能够在全球商家处使用Floki进行交易，大大提高了其可用性。除此之外，Floki通过燃烧计划不断改进其代币经济学，显示出对减少供应并长期推高价值的承诺。其未来发展依赖于持续的发展、用户采用和更多基于实用性的功能。Floki有潜力成为模因币领域的竞争者。 <div>
<p>Floki, a popular meme coin, has gained mainstream traction after its integration with Binance Pay. This integration grants over 12 million active users the ability to utilize Floki for transactions with merchants worldwide, significantly boosting its usability and potentially solidifying its position within the competitive meme coin market.</p>

<p>The news comes amidst a resurgence in the meme coin space, with Floki emerging as a frontrunner in terms of utility.</p>
<h2>Binance Integrates Floki For Payments</h2>
<p>The Binance Pay integration allows users to seamlessly pay for goods and services using the memecoin across the globe, not only at physical stores accepting crypto payments but also within the Binance app&#8217;s Marketplace.</p>
<p>This newfound functionality opens up a wider range of use cases for the memecoin, potentially differentiating it from other meme coins like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Beyond user base expansion, the team seems laser-focused on improving its tokenomics through a strategic token burning program. In March alone, a staggering 214 billion tokens, exceeding $55 million, were burned.</p>
<p>This aggressive burning initiative surpasses the combined burns of other top meme coins, demonstrating the coin&#8217;s commitment to reducing its overall supply and potentially driving up its value in the long term.</p>
<p>Related Reading: <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/will-bitcoin-burst-demand-outpaces-supply/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Will Bitcoin Burst? Demand Outpaces Supply, Liquidity Crisis A Threat</a></p>
<p>The token burning program itself is fueled by two primary mechanisms. Firstly, the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/floki" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Floki</a> Staking Program incentivizes long-term holding by penalizing early unstaking with a burn of 5-20% of the staked tokens.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/NRKrtiaF/" width="2475" /></p>

<p>This shaves a portion of circulating tokens from the market, tightening supply. Secondly, the FlokiFi Locker, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol built on the ecosystem, contributes to the burn process by acquiring and getting rid of tokens whenever they are used on specific blockchain networks.</p>
The Road Ahead For The Memecoin
<p>While the Binance Pay integration and aggressive burning program are positive steps, its<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/floki-open-interest-soars-by-1-b-in-1-day/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> long-term viability</a> hinges on continuous development, user adoption, and a shift towards more utility-driven functionalities.</p>
<p>The crypto&#8217;s integration with Binance Pay and its commitment to tokenomics through burning initiatives position it as a potential contender in the meme coin space.</p>
<p>However, the long-term success of Floki, like any other meme coin, relies heavily on its ability to evolve beyond mere hype and establish itself as a valuable player within the cryptocurrency ecosystem.</p>

<title>Binance Establishes First-Ever Board Of Directors Following Legal Setbacks</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/binance-establishes-first-ever-board-of-directors/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/binance-establishes-first-ever-board-of-directors/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。Binance首次任命董事会，其中成员包括来自公司内部和外部的人士。这一举措表明该交易所正在努力建立更加常规的公司结构，并改善治理和合规措施以解决监管挑战。该董事会的有效性将对该交易所在数字资产领域的未来发展至关重要。 <div>
<p>Binance, the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, has taken a significant step towards reshaping its operations by appointing a board of directors for the first time. This move comes after the exchange pleaded guilty last year to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-cz-grapple-with-massive-2-7-billion-fine/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">US charges</a> related to anti-money laundering (AML) and sanctions violations. </p>
<h2>Binance Unveils Inaugural Board Of Directors</h2>
<p>According to a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-01/crypto-exchange-binance-names-its-first-board-of-directors" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, the board consists of seven members, with Gabriel Abed, the former ambassador of Barbados to the United Arab Emirates, assuming the role of chairman. Binance CEO Richard Teng is also a member of the board, along with three other company executives: Heina Chen, Jinkai He, and Lilai Wang. </p>
<p>Two external members, Arnaud Ventura (Managing Partner of Gojo &amp; Co) and Xin Wang (CEO of Bayview Acquisition Corp.), are also part of the newly appointed board of directors of the exchange. </p>

<p>Chen, He, and Wang, who have reportedly been with Binance since its inception, are among the founding team members of the exchange. Chen currently holds a senior executive and co-founder position at Binance, while Wang is responsible for the exchange&#8217;s <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/hong-kong-crypto-exchange-shuts-down-unexpectedly/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">technology development</a>.</p>
<p>Some experts have expressed their views on the composition of the board. Austin Campbell, an adjunct professor at Columbia Business School and a consultant for blockchain firms, believes that having a board primarily composed of company insiders indicates “resistance” to outside control and oversight.</p>
<p>Campbell also suggests that the alleged “lack of independent members” with “deep” regulated financial risk or <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-executive-sues-nigerian-government/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">compliance </a>experience may not be ideal. However, he acknowledges that the board appointment is a step in the right direction and emphasizes the importance of “effective governance” moving forward.</p>
<h2>Steps Toward Conventional Corporate Structure</h2>
<p>The appointment of the board marks one of the significant changes being implemented at Binance since Richard Teng took over as CEO in November. As <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-ceo-affirms-no-changes-to-top-executives/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">reported </a>by Bitcoinist, Teng assumed leadership following the settlement between Binance and US authorities. </p>
<p>The exchange has yet to announce its global headquarters, and the board&#8217;s formation is seen as part of the company&#8217;s efforts to establish a more conventional corporate structure, according to Bloomberg.</p>
<p>In February, Binance agreed to pay $4.3 billion after a US judge approved a plea deal. The settlement was part of a case against Binance in which founder <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-former-ceo-czs-wealth-skyrockets-25-billion/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Changpeng Zhao</a> (CZ) also <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-ceo-to-step-down-4-billion-settlement/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">pleaded guilty</a> to charges related to anti-money laundering and sanctions violations. Zhao is expected to be sentenced around April 25.</p>

<p>The appointment of a board of directors at Binance represents a significant milestone in the exchange&#8217;s ongoing transformation. </p>
<p>By enhancing governance and compliance measures, Binance aims to address regulatory challenges and rebuild trust within the crypto industry. The board&#8217;s effectiveness in guiding the company&#8217;s future endeavors will be key to its success as it navigates the evolving landscape of digital assets.</p>

<title>IPO Alert: Thailand’s Crypto Behemoth Bitkub Sets Sights On 2025 Listing</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/ipo-alert-thailands-crypto-behemoth-bitkub-sets/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/ipo-alert-thailands-crypto-behemoth-bitkub-sets/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />泰国主要加密市场的Bitkub Capital Group Holdings表示计划在2025年进行首次公开募股（IPO）。此举旨在加强公司地位和为未来计划融资。Bitkub在2023年暗示即将进行公开上市，自七月以来一直在积极推进这一计划。尽管泰国金融部门支持将泰国打造成数字资产中心，泰国证券交易委员会对加密金融产品采取谨慎立场，目前不允许交易现货交易所交易基金（ETFs）。尽管如此，该国证券交易委员会保证投资者可以通过持牌的国内交易所进行数字资产投资，确保给泰国投资者一个“受监管和透明”的环境。 <div>
<p>In a move signaling the maturation of the crypto market in Thailand, Bitkub Capital Group Holdings, the proprietor of the nation&#8217;s foremost crypto exchange, has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-01/thailand-s-biggest-crypto-exchange-hiring-advisers-for-2025-ipo" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> its intention to conduct an initial public offering (IPO) by 2025.</p>
<p>This revelation was made by Jirayut Srupsrisopa, the CEO of Bitkub, during an interview with Bloomberg. According to Jirayut, the planned IPO, aimed at listing on the Stock Exchange of Thailand, represents a step to &#8220;amplify&#8221; the company&#8217;s stature and secure <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/thailands-bank-takes-over-local-crypto-exchange/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">additional capital</a> for future ventures.</p>

<h2>A Competitive Landscape And Regulatory Environment</h2>
<p>Bitkub&#8217;s journey toward this IPO began in a 2023 shareholder letter, hinting at an upcoming public listing without a specific timeline.</p>
<p>The move towards public listing gained further momentum last July when Bitkub sold a 9.2% stake in its exchange unit to Asphere Innovations Pcl, valuing the company at approximately 6 billion baht ($16.5 million).</p>
<p>The CEO expressed optimism that Bitkub Online&#8217;s valuation would surge as<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/thailand-targets-crypto-traders-with-new-tax-policy/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> trading volumes</a> approach the zenith seen during the crypto bull market in 2021.</p>
<p>Jirayut further disclosed that amidst Bitcoin&#8217;s surge to new highs, Bitkub is on an expansion trail, &#8220;boosting&#8221; its workforce to meet the anticipated growth and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/thailand-to-ban-crypto-staking-and-lending/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">market demands</a>. The decision to go public comes during intense competition within Southeast Asia&#8217;s second-largest economy.</p>
<p>Notable players such as Binance and Kasikornbank Pcl have made strides to capture market share from Bitkub, as reported by Bloomberg, underscoring the interest and investment in crypto trading within Thailand.</p>
<p>According to the news media, the number of active crypto trading accounts witnessed a significant increase, reaching a peak in September 2022. This surge in trader activity underscores the growing appetite for digital assets in the region, setting the stage for Bitkub&#8217;s growth plans.</p>
<img alt="The crypto market cap on TradingView" height="1496" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/gXFqm1hE/" width="2770" />
<h2>Thailand&#8217;s Stance On Crypto</h2>
<p>While Bitkub gears up for its IPO, the regulatory landscape for crypto in Thailand presents a nuanced picture. The Thai Finance Ministry has recently<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/thailands-crypto-becomes-vat-free-are-the-details/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> announced the exemption of value-added tax (VAT) on digital assets trading</a> “to push Thailand towards becoming a digital asset hub.”</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Finance Ministry has announced the exemption of VAT on trades in digital assets, to boost capital mobilisation through digital assets, in an attempt to make Thailand regional digital asset hub, says Paopoom Rojanasakul, secretary to Finance Minister. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ThaiPBSWorld?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#ThaiPBSWorld</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Thailand?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#Thailand</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VAT?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#VAT</a></p>
<p>— Thai PBS World (@ThaiPBSWorld) <a href="https://twitter.com/ThaiPBSWorld/status/1754798508027400546?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">February 6, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>However, Thailand&#8217;s Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has adopted a cautious approach towards a crypto-related financial product, particularly the trading of spot exchange-traded Funds (ETFs).</p>
<p>Despite the US SEC&#8217;s approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs, Thailand&#8217;s SEC has stated its position to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/thailands-sec-rejects-spot-bitcoin-etf-heres-why/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">refrain from allowing the establishment of spot Bitcoin ETFs</a> in the country &#8220;for the time being.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the country&#8217;s SEC assures investors that investing in digital assets remains accessible through licensed domestic exchanges, ensuring a &#8220;regulated and transparent&#8221; environment for Thai investors.</p>

<title>April’s Crypto Game-Changers: 7 Events Set To Drastically Impact The Course Of Digital Currencies</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/aprils-crypto-game-changers-7-events-set-to-impact/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/aprils-crypto-game-changers-7-events-set-to-impact/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。4月将是加密行业一个关键的月份，标志着多个重要事件和里程碑的到来，可能会对数字资产格局产生重大影响。主要事件包括比特币现金(BCH)的减半事件、美国消费价格指数(CPI)的公布、SEC与美国加密交易所之间的诉讼截止日期、比特币减半事件、Runes协议的推出、Binance前CEO的判决听证会和EigenLayer的主网上线。这些事件将极大地塑造数字资产领域的未来。BTC目前交易于$68,690，过去24小时下跌2.6％，过去七天下跌2.4％。 <div>
<p>As the crypto market ended March positively, the industry gears up for an eventful April, marked by crucial developments and milestones that could significantly impact the digital asset landscape. </p>
<h2>Crypto Halvings And Regulatory Deadlines</h2>
<p>The month starts with the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) halving event <a href="https://www.bitdegree.org/halving/bitcoin-cash-halving" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">scheduled</a> for April 2nd. Similar to Bitcoin (BTC), BCH undergoes a halving approximately every four years, which reduces mining profits for BCH miners. </p>

<p>On April 10, the US is scheduled to announce March&#8217;s <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-hater-the-fed-has-lost/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Consumer Price Index</a> (CPI), a vital indicator that measures the average price change paid by urban consumers for a basket of goods and services. </p>
<p>The Federal Reserve closely monitors the CPI as it influences inflation and, consequently, the central bank&#8217;s decisions regarding interest rates. Any changes in interest rates can ripple effect on the overall crypto market performance.</p>
<p>April 19 marks the deadline for the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and US crypto exchange <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/usdc-coinbasehistory-repeat-bitcoin-rally/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Coinbase </a>to reach an agreement in their ongoing legal battle. </p>
<p>As <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/breaking-coinbase-sec-case-reaches-critical-point/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">reported </a>by Bitcoinist, the court previously ruled in favor of the SEC, supporting claims that Coinbase operated as an exchange, broker, and clearing agency. However, the court also sided with Coinbase on certain claims regarding its wallet. </p>
<h2>Bitcoin Halving Approaches</h2>
<p>One of the most highly anticipated events in the crypto world, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/why-bitcoin-halving-could-bring-uncertainty-to-mining-industry/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin block reward halving</a>, is scheduled for April 25. Occurring approximately every four years, this event reduces the mining reward for contributors securing the network by 50%. As a result, the rate at which new BTC are introduced into circulation slows down. </p>
<p>Coinciding with the Bitcoin halving on April 25, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/what-are-bitcoin-runes/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Runes protocol</a> is expected to launch around April 25. Runes is a Bitcoin-native digital commodities protocol that introduces a novel fungible token system on the Bitcoin network. </p>
<p>The sentencing hearing of Changpeng Zhao (CZ), the former CEO of Binance, is expected to occur on April 30. CZ pleaded guilty to failure to maintain an effective anti-money laundering program at Binance. CZ agreed to step down as CEO and pay a $50 million fine as part of the plea agreement. Binance also agreed to pay substantial fines of more than $4.3 billion and restitution.</p>

<p>Lastly, EigenLayer&#8217;s mainnet launch is expected at the end of April. Mainnet is when a blockchain protocol is fully developed and deployed, allowing cryptocurrency transactions to be broadcasted, verified, and recorded on a distributed ledger technology (blockchain). </p>
<p>April will be an eventful month for the crypto industry, with several key events that could have significant implications. From Halving to regulatory decisions to protocol launches, these events will most likely have the potential to shape the future of the digital asset landscape. </p>

<title>Bitcoin Sees Another Major Coinbase Outflow: $1.2 Billion This Time</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-major-coinbase-outflow-1-2-billion-time/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-major-coinbase-outflow-1-2-billion-time/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。最新数据显示，比特币刚刚在一周内第二次大量流出Coinbase，约有11.2亿美元的BTC离开了交易平台。这表明投资者正在将大量比特币转移到自己的钱包中，可能意味着长期持有和累积。这种行为对比特币价格可能产生积极影响。同时，BTC价格下跌至68,500美元。<br /> <div>
<p>Data shows Bitcoin has just seen its second large outflow from Coinbase in a week, as almost $1.2 billion in BTC has left the platform.</p>
<h2>A Large Amount Of Bitcoin Has Just Been Withdrawn From Coinbase</h2>
<p>As an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/660a975d3177430cdc73271f-The-Second-Biggest-Bitcoin-Outflow-From-Coinbase-in-A-Week" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> explained, the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has just seen the exit of 17,000 BTC. The on-chain indicator of relevance here is the &#8220;<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/not-your-keys-bitcoin-exchange-outflows-new-ath/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">exchange outflow</a>,&#8221; which measures the total amount of Bitcoin being transferred out of the wallets of a given centralized exchange.</p>

<p>When the value of this metric is high, it means that the investors are withdrawing large amounts from the platform right now. Generally, holders take coins off to self-custody when they plan to hold for extended periods, so this trend can be a sign that long-term accumulation is happening in the market.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the indicator&#8217;s low level suggests not many holders are transferring coins out of these central entities at the moment. Depending on the trend in the opposite metric, the exchange inflow, such a trend, may be either neutral or bearish for the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price.</p>
<p>Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin exchange outflow specifically for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-clo-coinbase-vs-sec-is-far-from-over/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Coinbase</a> Advanced over the past week:</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Coinbase Outflow" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="607" src="https://i0.wp.com/img.cryptoquant.com/192610/quicktake/YfSogq4_8ac0ce5efbddb33ad112d4c233402ae9a1dfa35faf4feeda284134d2b144dd62.png?resize=1280%2C607&#038;ssl=1" width="1280" /></p>

<p>As the above graph shows, the Bitcoin exchange outflow for Coinbase has spiked in the past day. In total, 17,000 BTC have moved out of the platform with this massive withdrawal. At the current exchange rate of the asset, this stack would be worth a whopping $1.17 billion.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also apparent in the chart that the indicator had witnessed a spike of a very similar scale just a few days ago. Specifically, 16,800 BTC had flowed out of Coinbase in that withdrawal event.</p>
<p>This would mean two major buying moves may have occurred on the exchange in the past week. Coinbase is known to be the preferred platform for US-based institutional entities, so it&#8217;s possible that this potential buying came from these humongous traders.</p>

<p>Since the Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval back near the start of the year, the BTC price action has appeared to have been affected by the movements of the institutional investors, as <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-coinbase-premium-deep-red-reason-crash/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">another metric has suggested</a>.</p>
<p>Given this fact, these outflows can naturally be bullish for the asset&#8217;s price if they reflect the presence of buying pressure in the market.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>While this huge outflow has just occurred for the cryptocurrency, its price has slid down, now falling to just $68,500. The chart below shows Bitcoin&#8217;s performance over the last few days.</p>

<title>Inside Ethereum’s Roadmap: Buterin Reveals Plans For The Purge</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-roadmap-buterin-reveals-plans-the-purge/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-roadmap-buterin-reveals-plans-the-purge/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。 Vitalik Buterin提出了名为“The Purge”的计划，旨在通过简化协议和引入一些EIP来改善以太坊网络的操作和安全性。核心改进包括删除废弃功能，优化EVM、历史数据管理和LOG操作，以及过渡到SimpleSerialize（SSZ）。这些措施有助于提高以太坊的可扩展性、安全性和可持续性，并为未来的挑战做好准备。目前，ETH的交易价格为3524美元。 <div>
<p>In an in-depth exploration of Ethereum&#8217;s future, co-founder Vitalik Buterin has <a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1774729072561811583" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">detailed</a> an ambitious set of initiatives aimed at refining the protocol and easing the burden on node operators. Dubbed &#8220;The Purge,&#8221; this multifaceted plan targets the removal of obsolete functionalities and the introduction of several Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) to streamline the network&#8217;s operations and security.</p>
<p>Through a series of technical enhancements and optimizations, Buterin seeks not just simplification but a profound <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/vitalik-buterin-reveals-ethereums-roadmap-for-2024/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">evolution of ETH</a> in its operational dynamics.</p>
<h2>The Broader Purge: A Sweeping Clean-Up</h2>
<p>At the core of The Purge is EIP-6780, which emerged from the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-fees-spike-but-relief-on-the-horizon/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Dencun hard fork</a>, dramatically diminishing the SELFDESTRUCT opcode&#8217;s capabilities. This opcode, which enables contracts to eliminate themselves from the blockchain, has been restricted to only operate if the contract was created in the same transaction.</p>
<p>&#8220;EIP-6780 is a pivotal example of our commitment to protocol simplification by stripping away complexity while enhancing security,&#8221; Buterin articulated in his blog post. The adjustments introduced by EIP-6780, while seemingly incremental, lay down essential invariants that simplify the construction and maintenance of ETH clients and infrastructure.</p>

<p>Buterin elaborates on these changes: &#8220;Post EIP-6780, a new invariant caps the number of storage slots editable in a single block, directly facilitating the eventual implementation of Verkle trees. Moreover, a contract will maintain its code throughout a transaction or block, bolstering security and efficiency across the board.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beyond the confines of EIP-6780, The Purge encompasses a broad spectrum of enhancements. Geth&#8217;s recent purge of thousands of lines of legacy code, the dismissal of &#8220;empty accounts,&#8221; and the establishment of an 18-day blob storage window post-Dencun represent pivotal strides towards a leaner, more agile Ethereum.</p>
<p>&#8220;These measures are not merely about reducing storage and computational overheads; they&#8217;re about ensuring Ethereum remains scalable, secure, and sustainable,&#8221; Buterin notes, highlighting the importance of these seemingly backend optimizations for the broader ecosystem.</p>
<p>Buterin points to the diminishing relevance and inherent complexities of precompiles within the Ethereum framework. &#8220;The utility of certain precompiles has not met our initial expectations, complicating new EVM implementations and presenting consensus challenges,&#8221; Buterin observes, suggesting a phased removal or replacement with EVM-compatible code to mitigate these issues without adversely impacting existing applications.</p>
EIP-4444, LOG Reform And Transition To SSZ
<p>One of the most transformative proposals within The Purge is EIP-4444, which aims to redefine how Ethereum nodes manage historical data. By limiting the storage obligation to a manageable duration, Buterin proposes a paradigm shift in node operation, potentially democratizing node maintenance and fostering greater decentralization.</p>
<p>&#8220;Imagine a future where nodes, by not being burdened with the entirety of history, can operate more efficiently, contributing to a more decentralized network,&#8221; Buterin muses, emphasizing the strategic importance of EIP-4444 in Ethereum&#8217;s long-term vision.</p>

<p>Buterin also proposes a LOG reform to address the inefficiencies in how decentralized applications query historical event data. &#8220;Our current mechanism is too slow, pushing dApps towards centralized solutions. By simplifying the LOG opcode and leveraging ZK-SNARKs, we can create a more efficient and decentralized framework for accessing logs,&#8221; Buterin argues, showcasing a commitment to maintaining Ethereum&#8217;s decentralized ethos while improving its technical infrastructure.</p>
<p>The transition to SimpleSerialize (SSZ) represents another cornerstone of The Purge, promising a more streamlined and efficient serialization method. &#8220;SSZ not only simplifies the specification but also significantly reduces Merkle proof sizes, enhancing both efficiency and security,&#8221; Buterin explains, underscoring the critical nature of this transition for Ethereum&#8217;s future.</p>
A Leaner, More Efficient Ethereum
<p>Through The Purge, Ethereum is not merely shedding excess weight but is undergoing a profound transformation. By addressing legacy issues, optimizing operational efficiencies, and laying down a roadmap for future enhancements, Ethereum is poised to enhance its scalability, security, and sustainability.</p>
<p>&#8220;These efforts are about more than simplification; they&#8217;re about ensuring Ethereum&#8217;s resilience and adaptability in the face of future challenges,&#8221; Buterin concludes, casting a vision of an <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/vitalik-buterin-ethereum-network/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ethereum network</a> that is leaner, more efficient, and ready for the demands of tomorrow.</p>
<p>At press time, ETH traded at $3,524.</p>

<title>Shiba Inu Turns Bullish: Crypto Analyst Predicts Massive Price Surge</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-turns-bullish-crypto/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-turns-bullish-crypto/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。Shiba Inu (SHIB) 在测试价格水平48小时后表现出了弹性。分析师预测SHIB将达到$0.0008价格水平，基于Elliot Waves。Xanrox表示SHIB的价格动作将形成一个旗形图案，预示着牛市即将到来。他指出SHIB有望在4月突破$0.00003的强阻力点，并达到$0.000058。当前SHIB的价格为$0.00002873。 <div>
<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB) has <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-dips-below-0-00003-again-can-bulls-reverse-the-bullish-momentum/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">dipped below $0.00003 again</a> after testing the price level for more than 48 hours. Despite this, the cryptocurrency has largely exhibited signs of resilience from the bulls after its strong price surge in early March, prompting analysts to persist <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-price-mirrors-2021/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">on a bullish outlook</a>.</p>
<p>According to a crypto analyst known as Xanrox, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/the-triple-titans-of-crypto-solana-dogecoin-and-shiba-inu-compared/">Shiba Inu</a> is on its way to the $0.0008 price level. Interestingly, the analyst&#8217;s prediction is based on a series of Elliot Waves, allowing him to identify potential price support and resistance zones in the long term.</p>
<h2>Analyst Predicts Massive Price Surge For Shiba Inu</h2>
<p>Xanrox, who periodically drops crypto outlooks on Tradingview, has now joined a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-going-to-0-0001/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">cohort of analysts</a> foreseeing the continuation of a price uptrend for Shiba Inu. His <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/chart/SHIBUSDT/BzRa6PlA-SHIBA-Buy-here-do-not-miss-next-pump-HUGE/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">SHIB analysis</a>, which he titled &#8220;Buy here, do not miss next pump,&#8221; dates as far back as March 17 and has constantly been updated as the price action plays out. </p>

<p>Interestingly, the first 3-day timeframe chart shared by the analyst looked at SHIB&#8217;s position nine days after it reached $0.00004556. Shiba Inu had started to consolidate by this time and had fallen to $0.00002763. However, according to Xanrox, the consolidation opens up the perfect opportunity to load up on SHIB. His entry point, which is at $0.0000225, coincides with the 0.618 Fibonacci retracement level. </p>
<p>Xanrox also noted that SHIB&#8217;s price action will form a flag pattern, which is a perfect indicator of a bullish breakout. The crypto&#8217;s price has well, in fact, gone ahead to complete a flag formation. However, in his most recent update, Xanrox noted that while a falling wedge pattern has been formed, it would be wise to wait for another Elliott Wave formation to the downside in order to be sure that the pattern is complete.</p>
<p>Most notable in his analysis is the use of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/can-elliott-waves-really-predict-price-bitcoin/">Elliott Waves</a> to bolster his bullish prediction and draw out price action in the next few months after the uptrend continuation. Using his knowledge of Elliot Wave Theory, Xanrox pinpointed $0.0008 as a potential price point for the end of the fifth impulse wave. Interestingly, this would mean a 317% increase from his optimal entry point. </p>
<h2>SHIB’s Outlook For April</h2>
<p>Xanrox pointed out that SHIB only has one major resistance on its way up, which is around its current all-time high of $0.000086. However, the cryptocurrency has now formed a strong resistance at the $0.00003 price point, which remains to be overcome.</p>

<p><a href="https://x.com/CryptoFaibik/status/1774326259050279391?s=20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">According to another analyst</a>, Shiba Inu could break out of this price level and reach $0.000058 this April. It will be necessary for SHIB bulls and enthusiasts to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-whales-make-big-moves-is-it-time-to-buy/">raise their accumulation</a> in order for this to become a reality.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.00002873, down by 5.8% in the past 24 hours. </p>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。一家总部位于萨尔瓦多的专注于比特币（BTC）教育的非营利组织最近推出了更新版本的比特币文凭计划。他们与萨尔瓦多教育部合作，在全国的学校推广比特币教育项目，帮助个人了解比特币及其相关的金融知识。该计划涵盖了比特币历史、政府发行货币的出现、挑战以及比特币如何提供解决方案等主题。文章还指出该组织的努力已经开始受到国际教育者的关注，并且目前教师们正在接受培训，以便在本地学校传授比特币课程。BTC市场价格为69460美元，过去24小时下跌了1.5%。 <div>
<p>A non-profit organization focused on Bitcoin (BTC) education, operating out of El Salvador, has recently unveiled an updated version of its Bitcoin Diploma program. The initiative aims to promote wider adoption of the leading cryptocurrency and educate individuals about the benefits of understanding its <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/country-el-salvador-buying-bitcoin-btc/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">underlying technology</a>.</p>
<h2>BTC Education Goes Mainstream</h2>
<p>Known as &#8220;Mi Primer Bitcoin&#8221; or &#8220;My First Bitcoin,&#8221; the organization started offering BTC classes in El Salvador after the country implemented the Bitcoin Law in 2021. </p>
<p>In June 2022, they launched the first 10-week educational program, enrolling 38 students from public schools in El Salvador. This initiative marked the first time a BTC Diploma program had been <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/el-salvador-bitcoin-investment/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">introduced </a>in any public school system worldwide.</p>
<p>The non-profit organization now collaborates with the Ministry of Education in El Salvador, which has adopted the open-source workbook as the primary resource for its BTC-focused educational program.</p>

<p>Through a pilot program in collaboration with the government and in partnership with Bitcoin Beach, a project developed for a &#8220;sustainable BTC economic ecosystem&#8221; on the coast of El Salvador, the non-profit organization is currently training <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/el-salvador-moves-over-5000-bitcoin-to-vault/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">700 public school </a>teachers across the country. These teachers will subsequently deliver the BTC Diploma curriculum in their local schools. </p>
<p>In addition, My First Bitcoin established a self-governing &#8220;Node Network&#8221; of frontline BTC educators in March 2023, with over 29 educational projects from 18 countries already employing the Bitcoin Diploma. </p>
<h2>Financial Literacy For The Bitcoin Era</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://x.com/MyfirstBitcoin_/status/1771666630138900654?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release </a>of the 2024 edition of the BTC Diploma represents a significant milestone in My First Bitcoin&#8217;s mission to promote global BTC adoption and financial empowerment. </p>
<p>The curriculum covers various topics, including the history of money, the emergence of government-issued currency, the challenges associated with <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/el-salvadors-bitcoin-dream-pays-off-83m-in-profit/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">fiat money</a>, and how BTC provides solutions to these issues. It also delves into the technical workings of BTC and the Lightning Network, the second-layer network that enables BTC&#8217;s smart contract functionality.  </p>
<p>The 175-page workbook is divided into ten chapters and designed for a ten-week learning program. All materials are publicly available on GitHub, and the organization actively encourages individuals to participate in translating the curriculum. </p>
<p>The 2023 edition has been translated into 23 languages by a network of over 40 international educators, including Korean, Swahili, Luganda, Russian, Tamil, Japanese, and Hindi.</p>

<p>John Dennehy, founder and executive director of My First Bitcoin, emphasized the organization&#8217;s belief in the power of BTC education. He stated: </p>
<blockquote><p>We believe Bitcoin education will change the world, and this new edition is a big step in that direction. Learning financial literacy for the BTC Era is empowering and leads to significant second-order effects. That knowledge will encourage us to build, to create, and to plan further into the future&#8211;and that changes everything.</p></blockquote>

<p>The largest cryptocurrency in the market is trading at $69,460, representing a price drop of 1.5% over the past 24 hours. </p>

<title>Dogecoin Mirrors 2021 Trends, Why A Surge To $12 Is Possible</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。<br />加密市场中的DOGE价格表现优异，在过去一周内表现出色。分析显示，DOGE价格可能攀升至12美元，这将意味着价格将上涨5,400%，目前价格为0.22美元。加密分析师指出，DOGE可能会经历一次大规模的涨势，类似于2018年至2021年的情况。分析显示了DOGE在未来一年内多个价格目标，包括0.26美元、0.41美元、0.73美元、1.5美元、2.2美元、3.9美元、6.22美元和12美元。这个分析得到了新兴竞争对手的支持，表明DOGE可能正处于一次大规模的牛市之中。 <div>
<p class="p2">As the crypto market navigates uncertain headwinds, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-whales-fill-up-their-bags-as-price-rallies/">Dogecoin has emerged as a beacon</a> in the night with its outperformance over the last week. Even at a time when coins continue to struggle, the DOGE price is still seeing reasonable upside, and if crypto analysts are anything to go by, the dog-themed meme coin still has a long way to go before it’s done.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Dogecoin Price Could Climb To $12</h2>
<p class="p2">Crypto Analyst Ali Martinez has been bullish on the Dogecoin price for a while, and with good reason. The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-whales-fill-up-their-bags-as-price-rallies/">DOGE</a> price has already grown around 100% in the last month. Then, after a brief dip, its price recovered once more to reach a new three-year high.</p>

<p class="p2">Following this, Martinez has come forward with an analysis that shows that Dogecoin is indeed just starting. The chart which was shared on X (formerly Twitter) shows multiple price targets for the meme coin ver the next year. In the chart, a number of price targets have already been hit but there’s more to go.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I feel my fellow degens have been distracted with the new shiny <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/memecoins?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">#memecoins</a>, but <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Dogecoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">#Dogecoin</a> remains the most important <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/altcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">#altcoin</a> in this sector.</p>
<p>From a technical perspective, <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DOGE?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">#DOGE</a> seems to mirror the 2018-2021 pattern. If so, <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24DOGE&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">$DOGE</a> could be at the very beginning of a massive… <a href="https://t.co/WGREwsxPcb" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/WGREwsxPcb</a></p>
<p>— Ali (@ali_charts) <a href="https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1774509832629854365?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">March 31, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p class="p2">The crypto analyst pointed out that the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-developer-utility-doge/">Dogecoin price is sticking closely to the trend</a> that was seen between 2018 and 2021, which is incredibly bullish for the coin. This is because, after the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-doge-payments-x/">DOGE price</a> finished consolidating in 2021, it would go on a massive rally, rising from $0.002 to a new all-time high price of $0.7.</p>
<p class="p2">This time around, the DOGE price has been consolidating for three years as well between 2022 and 2024, and the breakout looks to have begun. As a result, Dogecoin could go on a more than 5,000% run to reach new all-time highs.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Roadmap To $12</h2>
<p class="p2">The analysis shared by Ali Martinez shows the top of the target to be $12 for Dogecoin. Now, if <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-shiba-inu-ethereum/">DOGE</a> were to reach this level, it would mean that the price will rise 5,400% from its current value of $0.22 at the time of this writing.</p>

<p class="p2">However, before then, there are a number of important levels for the meme coin to clear before it reaches $12. From its <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-10-drop-66-million/">current price level</a>, the next point is $0.26 before moving upwards to $0.41. Following this, the chart shows $0.73 and then $1.5. Moving upwards, there’s $2.2, $3.9, $6.22, and then $12 at the very top.</p>
<p class="p2">As the analyst explains, despite the emergence of new meme coin competitors, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-price-surged-weekend/">Dogecoin retains its position and the leading meme coin</a>, which lends credence to this analysis. “From a technical perspective, #<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-shiba-inu-ethereum/">DOGE</a> seems to mirror the 2018-2021 pattern. If so, $DOGE could be at the very beginning of a massive parabolic bull run!” Martinez said.</p>

<title>TRON Vs SEC: Justin Sun Seeks Lawsuit Dismissal For Lack of “Jurisdiction And Regulatory Guidance”</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/tron-vs-sec-justin-sun-seeks-lawsuit-dismissal-for-lack-of-jurisdiction-and-regulatory-guidance/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/tron-vs-sec-justin-sun-seeks-lawsuit-dismissal-for-lack-of-jurisdiction-and-regulatory-guidance/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章介绍了Tron创始人Justin Sun和其他被告在美国证券交易委员会(SEC)诉讼中提出的驳回申请，称缺乏“管辖权”和“监管指南”。被告批评SEC对加密行业的打击，并请求驳回指控。他们指出SEC针对数字资产的监管范围扩大太远，不应该被接受。最后，被告声称SEC对他们指控缺乏明确性，并指出缺乏公平通知。 <div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Tron&#8217;s founder Justin Sun, The Tron Foundation, and other defendants in the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit have presented a motion to dismiss the regulator’s complaint due to a lack of “jurisdiction” and “regulatory guidance.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The case started a year ago when the SEC charged the defendants for allegedly offering unregistered securities with Tron (TRX) and BitTorrent (BTT) tokens.</p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">SEC’s Crackdown On The Crypto Industry Faces More Criticism</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Last year, the SEC <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sec-accuses-crypto-giant-justin-sun-of-securities-law-violation/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">charged</a> Justin Sun and his companies ­–Tron Foundation, BitTorrent, and Rainberry Inc.– for offering and selling &#8220;unregistered securities since Tron (TRX)’s Initial Coin Offering (ICO) in 2017.&#8221;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, the US regulator accused the defendants of fraud and charged several celebrities, including Lindsay Lohan, Jake Paul, and Austin Mahone, for “illegally touting Sun’s crypto asset securities.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The case’s most recent development involves Sun and the defendants <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.596044/gov.uscourts.nysd.596044.55.0.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">seeking</a> the lawsuit’s dismissal and asserting several criticisms of the US regulator’s crackdown on the crypto industry. The motion, filed on March 28, states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Yet another salvo in the SEC’s ever-widening campaign seeking dominion over digital assets whenever created, in whatever form, for whatever purpose, and wherever they may be found.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In the document, the defendants criticize the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bigger-argument-in-ripple-vs-us-sec-case/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">SEC’s efforts</a> to “leverage highly attenuated contacts to the United States” to extend its regulatory reach to predominantly foreign products. “The SEC is not a worldwide regulator,” and these attempts have gone “too far and should be rejected.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, the defendants highlighted that this case is “fundamentally unlike the vast majority of enforcement actions involving digital assets to date.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The argument presents the involvement of the development of blockchain products that are designed to promote, reward, and democratize “content sharing, not securities offering.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The SEC has ignored all but one focus of the projects, reducing the whitepapers in hindsight to “investor” communications about “token offerings,” according to the document.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">By disregarding the technology, purpose, and governance of projects, the SEC has reduced the role of tokens within these projects to be the “only aim for these projects.” Consequently, the US regulator’s “narrow reading” doesn’t hold up.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">TRON’s Claims For Case Dismissal</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The motion states the lack of regulatory clarity as one of the reasons for the dismissal request, as “the SEC has offered limited, often inconsistent, guidance.” It also argues that the regulatory guidelines offered before the TRX&#8217;s launch tackled activities “very different from the token functions” in this lawsuit.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">After the launch of TRX, the following “regulation by enforcement actions generally did not concern secondary market transactions.” As a result, the SEC “largely relies on generalizations and conclusions to support its already thin, frequently indiscernible claims.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The absence of jurisdictional power is a crucial point, stating that the SEC has failed to show that executing personal jurisdiction is appropriate over foreign defendants.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The defendants claim the SEC has made a “strained attempt” to establish a nexus between the US and the products in the complaint. These efforts include turning the “ordinary course” of global secondary market trading, contests, giveaways, and free airdrops into unregistered and “improper” US securities offerings.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The motion claims that even if the SEC could prove their jurisdiction over foreign defendants and worldwide platforms offering services to the global public, the SEC’s claim still fails to hold up:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Even if it could be shown that personal jurisdiction over the foreign defendants is appropriate here, the claims still fail for myriad, equally powerful reasons.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Per the document, the SEC has failed to offer factual allegations and lay out the role of each defendant in each of its claims. Instead, it has labeled all <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-tycoon-justin-sun-summoned-by-us-court/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">defendant parties</a> as “the Sun Defendants,” asserting that they have done “various acts to satisfy Rule 9(b)’s strict requirement to plead fraud with particularity.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, the document highlights the lack of fair notice that the US regulator could attempt to pursue the claims in the complaint. Under these grounds, the defendants deem the complaint as subject to dismissal.</p>

<title>Shiba Inu Community Being Targeted By These Scams, Pundit Warns</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-community-scams-2/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-community-scams-2/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。<br />最近的报告显示，Shiba Inu社区成员成为骗子利用的目标。最新的恶意行为主要针对Shiba Inu的生态系统代币SHIB，特别是针对投资者。Shibarmy骗局警报揭示了骗子假冒合法奖励平台，鼓励社区成员通过点击链接连接他们的加密货币钱包来领取虚假代币。此外，骗局还包括其他欺诈手段，如社交媒体账户被盗、虚假广告等。建议Shiba Inu社区成员保持警惕，不要参与未经验证的平台，以确保他们的安全。 <div>
<p>Recent reports have indicated an alarming increase in <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-community-scams/">scam attacks</a> targeting Shiba Inu community members, aiming to exploit the community’s enthusiasm for fraudulent purposes. The latest wave of these malicious acts has specifically focused on investors of Shiba Inu’s newest ecosystem token, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/new-shiba-inu-ecosystem-token-march-7/">K9 Finance (KNINE).</a></p>
<h2>SHIB Scam Alerts On The Rise</h2>
<p>Shibarmy Scam Alerts, a Shiba Inu X (formerly Twitter) account <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-scam-security-threats/">dedicated to exposing scam attacks</a> in the community has <a href="https://x.com/susbarium/status/1773398066357285092?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">uncovered</a> a malicious actor posing as a legitimate rewards claim platform for the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-partner-token-featured-on-us-tv-station/">K9 Finance token. </a></p>

<p>Sharing a screenshot of the fraudulent account, Shibarmy scam alerts disclosed that the site had promised to distribute $400,000 worth of K9 Finance tokens to investors. Community members were encouraged to claim the token airdrops by clicking a link to connect their cryptocurrency wallet. </p>
<p>Typically, scam attacks like this <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-scams-beware/">target unsuspecting investors</a>, luring them into connecting their wallets and inadvertently granting malicious actors complete control over their wallet accounts. This enables the attackers to illegally access a user’s wallet to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-scammers-use-new-tactics-to-steal/">steal their cryptocurrency assets. </a></p>
<p>Interestingly, this is not the first scam attack made on the Shiba Inu community. Over the past month, the Shibarmy scam alert has exposed a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-message-exchanges/">string of scam attempts</a> aimed at the community.  </p>
<p>Previously in March, Shibarmy scam alert <a href="https://x.com/susbarium/status/1773376483542663229?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">revealed</a> a fraudulent scheme enticing investors with a fake airdrop of about 20,000,000 SHIB tokens. Similarly, Lucie, a prominent Shiba Inu marketing influencer <a href="https://x.com/lucieshib/status/1772878180304462186?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">raised concerns</a> about a potential breach of the X account, Mantra Protocol, after the company launched an unexpected airdrop for one of Shiba Inu’s native tokens, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-bone-new-target/">BONE</a>. </p>
<p>This <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-scams-persist-exit-scams-hacks-cost-crypto-sector-160-million-in-february/">rise in scam activities </a>is becoming a growing concern in the cryptocurrency space underscoring the vulnerability of the industry. It also significantly highlights the need for more enhanced security measures and scam awareness programs within the digital space. </p>
<h2>Shiba Inu Community Members Advised To Stay Vigilant</h2>
<p>In uncovering the latest scam attacks targeting community members, Shibarmy scam alerts advised investors and crypto enthusiasts to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/uk-crypto-scams-surge-by-23-lloyds-bank-warns/">exercise caution</a> and refrain from engaging in illicit platforms promising unverified rewards. The platform warned <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/investor-4-46-million-crypto-scam-after-withdrawal/">investors of connecting their wallet addresses</a> to malicious sites, emphasizing the need to prioritize their safety. </p>

<p>Besides the fake airdrops, numerous deceptive scam tactics such as <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-warns-community-about-copycat-scams-on-the-prowl/">impersonation</a>, social media account hacks, fake ads and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/over-2-6m-stolen-in-phishing-scam-involving-top-crypto-trader/">phishing attacks</a> have targeted unsuspecting members of the crypto community. This highlights the critical need to consistently verify information through official platforms and websites before taking any action. </p>
<p>As <a href="https://x.com/susbarium/status/1774295576391082351?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">stated</a> by Shibarmy scam alert, “If an offer seems too good to be true, it probably is a scam.”</p>

<title>Binance Ties Allegations Swirl As Hong Kong Crypto Exchange Shuts Down Unexpectedly</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/hong-kong-crypto-exchange-shuts-down-unexpectedly/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/hong-kong-crypto-exchange-shuts-down-unexpectedly/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。Hong Kong数字资产交易平台HKVAEX宣布将于2024年5月1日完全关闭。在未与币安正式合作的情况下，其启用了币安作为“合作伙伴”。此举反映了全球日益严格的加密货币监管趋势。随着香港金融监管机构努力为虚拟资产服务提供商建立明确的框架，HKVAEX决定关闭。用户需要在2024年4月30日前提取他们的资产，但撤回了监管申请引发了用户对资产安全的担忧。这次关闭事件引起了对加密货币交易所在严格监管环境中运营的未来的疑问。 <div>
<p>Hong Kong&#8217;s crypto landscape is shifting as HKVAEX, a local digital asset trading platform, announced a phased closure culminating in a complete shutdown by May 1st, 2024. This move comes amidst a growing global trend of increased regulatory scrutiny on the cryptocurrency industry.</p>

<p>HKVAEX was only in operation for five months after its December 2022 launch. Promotional materials identified Binance as a &#8220;partner,&#8221; although the exchange continuously denied any formal affiliation.</p>
<h2>Hong Kong Crypto Exchange Calls It Quits</h2>
<p>HKVAEX&#8217;s decision to shut down follows a period of heightened regulatory focus in Hong Kong. The Securities and Futures Commission, the city&#8217;s financial watchdog, has been striving to establish clear frameworks for virtual asset service providers. This includes stringent anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) standards, along with robust investor protection measures.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Hong Kong exchange HKVAEX, suspected to be owned by Binance, announced that it will be permanently closed and all users will withdraw their assets before April 30. The Hong Kong SFC shows that HKVAEX submitted a license application on January 4, 2024 and withdrew it on March 28.…</p>
<p>— Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1774285170834870301?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">March 31, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>The exchange&#8217;s struggles began in early 2024 when it reportedly applied for a license with the SFC. However, on March 28th, just weeks before the scheduled closure announcement, HKVAEX withdrew its application. Industry analysts believe this withdrawal points towards potential difficulties in meeting the SFC&#8217;s strict compliance requirements.</p>
<p>The impact of HKVAEX&#8217;s closure extends beyond a single platform. This event raises questions about the future of cryptocurrency exchanges operating in heavily regulated environments. It could be a harbinger of further consolidation within the industry as exchanges grapple with navigating complex regulatory landscapes.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/CDIUZcaU/" width="2475" /></p>














<h2>Critical Concern: HKVAEX Users&#8217; Inability To Retrieve Assets</h2>



HKVAEX users who are unable to retrieve their assets by April 30, 2024 are at the heart of the critical issue. The stringent deadline creates a sense of urgency, which in turn raises apprehensions regarding the security of their possessions. The sudden cessation of operations creates an environment of uncertainty, despite the exchange&#8217;s assurances that it will accommodate withdrawals.













<p>While HKVAEX has assured users of post-delisting support for asset withdrawals, the closure highlights the need for a more stable and predictable environment for cryptocurrency businesses. Striking a balance between fostering innovation in the digital asset space and ensuring robust regulatory oversight remains a key challenge for authorities worldwide.</p>
<p>The ripple effects of HKVAEX&#8217;s closure are likely to be felt most acutely in the Asia-Pacific region, which has historically been a hub for cryptocurrency activity. The region&#8217;s financial centers, like Hong Kong, are grappling with the integration of digital assets into their existing regulatory frameworks. This struggle could lead to a flight of cryptocurrency businesses to jurisdictions with less stringent regulatory environments.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Now Selling 500,000 BTC Per Month</h2>
<p>As explained in a <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoVizArt/status/1774488181896810731" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X by CryptoVizArt, a senior researcher at the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode, the BTC long-term holders have been selling recently, regardless of how bullish the mood around the market has been.</p>
<p>The &#8220;<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/hodling-steady-bitcoin-long-term-holder-supply-ath/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">long-term holders</a>&#8221; (LTHs) here refer to the Bitcoin investors who have been holding onto their coins since more than 155 days ago. These holders are known to display a strong resolve, as they don&#8217;t sell that often, despite whatever may be going on in the wider market.</p>

<p>Because of this strength, they are popularly known as the &#8220;diamond hands&#8221; of the sector. Since it&#8217;s uncommon to see the LTHs selling, the times that they do participate in distribution can be worth paying attention to, especially if the selloff is of any significant degree.</p>
<p>One way to track the behavior of these HODLers is through the &#8220;<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/how-much-capital-1-change-bitcoin-market-cap/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">net position change</a>&#8221; metric, which keeps track of the net amount of BTC that entered into or exited out of the wallets of these investors over the past 30 days.</p>
<p>Below is a chart shared by the analyst that displays the trend in this indicator for the LTHs over the past few years:</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin LTH Netflow" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="2359" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GKA8yGSW4AAcZbM?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096" width="4096" /></p>

<p>As is visible in the above graph, the Bitcoin LTH net position change has been negative recently. This would imply that coins have been leaving the addresses of these HODLers.</p>
<p>This selling from the cohort has come as the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price has gone through a sharp rally and has achieved fresh all-time highs (ATHs). From the chart, it&#8217;s visible that a trend like this also played out during the last two major bull runs.</p>
<p>In the recent distribution, the LTHs have been making net outflows at the rate of 490,000 to 520,000 BTC per month. As the Glassnode researcher has highlighted in the chart, the previous bull runs took around 4 to 5 months to top out after the LTH net position change hit such red levels.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible that if a similar pattern follows in the current bull run as well, a peak may be encountered in the next 4-5 months. Something that&#8217;s different this time around, though, is the presence of the Bitcoin <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-spot-etfs-odds-at-a-pessimistic-25/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs)</a>.</p>
<p>The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) turned into an ETF with the US SEC approval in January and since then, the fund has been observing major outflows. The coins held by GBTC fall inside the LTH range, so selling of them is naturally being counted under the LTH net position change.</p>

<p>As the analyst has noted, GBTC monthly outflows have ranged from around 90,000 to 100,000 BTC, which means that they have made up for about 20% of the recent LTH distribution.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>Bitcoin had surged beyond the $71,000 level earlier, but the original digital asset has seen a plunge over the past day that has now taken it to $69,700.</p>

<title>Dogecoin Community Set To Celebrate DOGE Day – What’s All The Fuss About?</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-community-doge-day/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-community-doge-day/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的<br />DOGE Day即将到来，预计将在活动前几天获得更多关注，有望积极影响其价格。文章介绍了DOGE Day的由来和意义，以及DOGE社区对其独特性的坚持。同时，文章提到了DOGE Day和比特币减半事件的可能重叠，预计DOGE社区可能会因此受到更多关注。此外，4月将推出Dogecoin期货，这可能增加对DOGE的兴趣并促使更多资金流入其生态系统。最后，文章提到了DOGE目前的价格和交易情况。 <div>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-bitcoin-spot-etfs/">The Dogecoin (DOGE) community</a> is brimming with anticipation of DOGE Day, which is fast approaching. The foremost meme coin is expected to gain <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/doge-open-interest-breaks-2-billion/">further attention</a> in the days leading up to the event, which could undoubtedly positively impact its price. </p>
<h2>What DOGE Day Is All About</h2>
<p>DOGE Day, celebrated on April 20, is earmarked to promote and reaffirm the values of the foremost meme coin <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-10-largest-meme-coin/">launched in 2013</a>. The meme coin, which was <a href="https://dogecoin.com/dogepedia/articles/history-of-dogecoin/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">created as a “joke,”</a> has continued to make a statement in the crypto market, and this journey is usually celebrated during DOGE Day.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, despite DOGE attaining this level of prominence, its community has always ensured the preservation of the crypto token&#8217;s goofy nature. As such, it is no surprise that DOGE Day is also on the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/420-day-in-crypto-remembering-the-class-of-altcoins-that-went-up-in-smoke/">same day</a> as the one meant to celebrate marijuana. Besides appreciating how far Dogecoin has come, the day is also expected to be filled with jokes and memes from the community. </p>
<p>However, the DOGE community might not have the undivided attention of the crypto community, as eyes will also be on the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bull-market-glassnode/">Bitcoin Halving</a> event. The Halving event is expected to occur sometime around that period and could even fall on the same day as DOGE Day. </p>
<p>If so, less attention might be paid to DOGE Day, considering how much more impact the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-supply-shock-57-of-btc-hasnt-moved-2-years/">Halving event</a> could have on the broader crypto market. Despite that, Bitcoin Halving falling on DOGE Day could turn out to be a remarkable occurrence for the DOGE community, especially if Bitcoin were to lead altcoins, including Dogecoin, to a massive pump on that day. </p>
<h2>Dogecoin Futures Set To Launch This Month</h2>
<p>April is already on course to be memorable for the meme coin. In addition to DOGE Day, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/coinbase-seeks-dismissal-of-default-judgement/">foremost US crypto exchange, Coinbase</a>, is set to <a href="https://x.com/PhoenixTrades_/status/1773873710786605425?s=20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">launch</a> Dogecoin futures for its institutional clients on April 29. This move is projected to increase the interest in DOGE and cause more liquidity to flow into its ecosystem. </p>

<p>Furthermore, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-price-rise-above-57000/#:~:text=Bitcoin%20isn&#039;t%20showing%20signs,a%20bullish%20narrative%20for%20BTC.">derivatives market</a> plays a significant role in any crypto token’s price discovery, which is why NewsBTC <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-price-breaks-new-3-year-high-here-are-factors-that-could-drive-the-price-to-1/#:~:text=An%20increase%20in%20the%20number,again%20to%20the%20crypto%20market." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">recently highlighted</a> this launch as one of the factors that could drive DOGE’s price to $1. Traders are already positioning themselves for further increases in DOGE’s price as Bitcoinist <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/doge-open-interest-breaks-2-billion/">recently reported</a> a surge in DOGE’s future open interest. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bitcoinist also reported that Dogecoin;s funding rate has remained positive since October 2023, strengthening the bullish sentiment around the meme coin. </p>
<p>At the time of writing, DOGE is trading at around $0.20, down in the last 24 hours, according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dogecoin/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">data</a> from CoinMarketCap. </p>

<title>Spot ETF Frenzy Cools Down – Are Bitcoin Investors Shifting Focus Now?</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etf-frenzy-waning-investors-shifting-focus/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。2024年1月推出的现货比特币交易所交易基金（ETF）引发了加密货币投资的变革。这些新的金融工具在短短三个月内吸引了超过120亿美元的资金，目前持有所有比特币的重要4.20％份额。然而，最近的数据显示了对ETF投资的放缓迹象，并且存在一些短期的担忧，尤其是新比特币进入市场时这些基金将不再吸收它们。尽管存在这些短期担忧，许多分析师对比特币的长期前景仍然持乐观态度。 <div>
<p>Spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), launched in January 2024, have become a game-changer for cryptocurrency investing.</p>
<p>These new financial instruments attracted a massive inflow of over $12 billion in just three months, currently holding a significant 4.20% share of all bitcoins.</p>
<p>Recent trends raise questions about their short-term impact and highlight the complex dynamics at play in the crypto market.</p>

<p>The initial surge in ETF investment was attributed to their ease of access for mainstream investors. Unlike traditional methods like crypto exchanges, ETFs offer a familiar trading platform and potentially lower fees.</p>
<p>This accessibility fueled optimism, with some analysts predicting a repeat of the parabolic price growth witnessed after the 2020 halving, where bitcoin&#8217;s value skyrocketed by 654%.</p>












<h2>Waning Interest: Signs Of Concern In Recent Bitcoin Data</h2>












<p>However, recent data paints a slightly concerning picture. While the initial euphoria was strong, <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/6607c5fb3177430cdc6e56aa-Projected-Supply-Absorption-of-Spot-ETFs-Turns-Negative" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">interest in spot bitcoin ETFs seems to be waning.</a> Crucially, these funds are no longer projected to absorb new bitcoins entering the market. In a recent report, the analyst operating under the alias Oinonen_t of CryptoQuant observed this.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-291076" height="648" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/a_312646.png?resize=1024%2C648" width="1024" /></p>

<p>This &#8220;negative supply absorption&#8221; could explain the stagnation in bitcoin&#8217;s price despite the approaching halving event, scheduled for later this month. The halving, by reducing the number of new bitcoins mined daily, is supposed to increase scarcity and theoretically drive up the price.</p>
<p>This slowdown in ETF investment could be attributed to several factors. One possibility is a shift in retail investor focus. With the rise of alternative cryptocurrencies like Solana-based tokens and meme coins, some investors might be exploring these potentially high-growth, high-risk options.</p>
<p>Additionally, concerns remain about the volatility inherent to the cryptocurrency market as a whole, which could deter some from long-term bitcoin investment through ETFs.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/4esx5Enb/" width="2475" /></p>

<h2>Bitcoin&#8217;s Long-Term Outlook Upbeat</h2>
<p>Despite these short-term concerns, the long-term outlook for bitcoin seems to remain positive for many analysts. The upcoming halving still presents a potential catalyst for price appreciation.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the overall market capitalization of bitcoin, currently a fraction of gold&#8217;s, could see significant growth if it reaches parity with the precious metal, as some predict. This would translate to a staggering 1000% increase in bitcoin&#8217;s value.</p>

<p>However, achieving such a feat relies heavily on factors outside the immediate scope of spot bitcoin ETFs. Regulatory environments, institutional adoption, and broader economic trends will all play a crucial role in shaping the future of bitcoin.</p>
<p>Spot bitcoin ETFs have undoubtedly opened up new avenues for mainstream investors to participate in the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p>Their initial success suggests a strong appetite for regulated, easy-to-access bitcoin exposure. However, the recent slowdown in investment and the lack of short-term price movement raise questions about their immediate impact.</p>

<title>Polygon CEO Debunks Layer 3 Networks, Contends Scaling Can Be Achieved Without Them</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/polygon-ceo-debunks-layer-3-networks/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/polygon-ceo-debunks-layer-3-networks/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。文章讨论了Polygon CEO对Layer 3网络的负面看法，认为它们可能会降低以太坊的价值。CEO不认为Layer 3对以太坊的扩展是必要的，并担心这些网络可能会破坏以太坊的安全性。另一方面，社区成员提出Layer 3解决方案的好处，包括原生桥接成本低、挑战游戏成本低和自定义gas令牌等。总之，文章探讨了Layer 3网络对以太坊的潜在影响。 <div>
<p>The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/polygon-connect-layer-2-networks-on-ethereum/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Polygon Labs</a> Marc Boiron, has expressed a negative sentiment towards layer 3 (L3) networks, arguing the necessity and implications of the solutions for scaling Ethereum &#8211; the second largest cryptocurrency asset.</p>
<h2>Polygon CEO Claims Layer 3 Devalues Ethereum</h2>
<p>In a heated <a href="https://x.com/0xMarcB/status/1774551016937324949?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">conversation</a> on the X platform, Marc Boiron claimed that these layer 3 networks pose a potential risk to the value of Ethereum. The Polygon CEO asserted that the major purpose of  L3s is to devalue ETH and the layer 2s that serve as the foundation for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-layer-3-protocols-might-be-a-thing/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">layer 3s</a>.</p>
<p>As a result, Boiron believes that layer 3 is not required to scale Ethereum. Since L3 networks are not required to scale current networks, Boiton has declared that Polygon Labs will not operate on the networks.</p>

<p>L2 solutions reduce network congestion through the diversion of transactions from the main chain. Additionally, they provide reliable benefits by transmitting the transactions to the main chain.</p>
<p>On the other hand, L3s can guarantee cross-chain connections between several protocols. Effectively, they might also support layer-1 and layer-2 network communication.</p>
<p>The Polygon&#8217;s CEO claims appear to have attracted much criticism from the crypto community. A pseudonymous X user disagreed with Boiron, saying that there is no such thing as taking away value from the asset and onto the L2s, as L2s on ETH are value Ethereum.</p>
<p>While Boiron agreed with the user that L2s are Ethereum, he disagrees with the notion that L2 value is ETH value. According to the Polygon CEO, ETH will essentially gain no value if all the L3s settle to a single <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-layer-2-network-growth/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">layer 2</a>. Consequently, the security of Ethereum will be compromised and will be vulnerable. </p>
<p>He then emphasized the possible dangers and consequences of these L3s devaluing the cryptocurrency excessively. &#8220;If Ethereum earns no fees and has no prospect of earning fees other than a tiny amount of fees from this one L2, then the value of ETH will drop,&#8221; he stated. </p>
<p>Given that it has no economic future, he believes it is obvious that it will keep falling; therefore, both the willingness to hold <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-and-ethereum-see-gains-nftfn-predicts-unprecedented-50x-profit/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">ETH</a> and to protect its network will fade among validators.</p>
<h2>Benefits Of Layer 3 Solutions</h2>
<p>The Polygon CEO&#8217;s insights suggest that layer 3 networks do not provide any major benefits to the cryptocurrency landscape. However, Peter Haymond, one of the community members in charge of creating Ethereum&#8216;s scaling solutions, has <a href="https://x.com/peterhaymond/status/1774563196147569073?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">spotlighted</a> several benefits of L3 solutions.</p>

<p>According to Haymond, these networks do not devalue ETH in any way, while drawing attention to Potuz&#8217;s post highlighting some of the advantages of L3s. These include the low cost of native bridging from L2 as opposed to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/layer-1-blockchain-technology-trends-to-look-for-in-2024/">L1</a>, the minimal cost of a challenge game or proving on the chain by playing the game in L2 rather than L1, custom gas tokens, and others.</p>

<title>Crypto Forecast: Top 5 Coins Set To Dominate This Week</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/weekly-crypto-forecast-top-5-coins/</link>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。本文介绍了本周在比特币和加密市场上将发生的五个主要要点：1. 机构投资机构购买现货比特币 ETF 的披露；2. Aptos 即将举办的 DeFi DAYS 活动引发合作伙伴猜测；3. Fetch.AI、SingularityNET 和 Ocean Protocol 合并提议为新代币 Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)；4. 比特币现金将迎来减半事件；5. Cosmos 令人瞩目地暗示即将进行重大的 Interchain 扩展。BTC 目前交易价格为 69,571 美元。 <div>
<p>This week in the Bitcoin and crypto market promises to be particularly eventful, with several key developments poised to capture investors&#8217; attention. From anticipated regulatory filings shedding light on institutional Bitcoin ETF investments to potential groundbreaking partnerships and innovative mergers in the DeFi and AI sectors, the landscape is ripe with opportunities and challenges. Here&#8217;s a closer look at the top 5 coins and developments that every crypto enthusiast, investor, and analyst should keep an eye on in the coming days.</p>
<h2>#1 Bitcoin: Who Has Bought The Spot ETFs?</h2>
<p>This week, the community is set to gain unprecedented insight into institutional investment patterns concerning spot Bitcoin ETFs, a development first reported by Bitcoinist. With the requirement for investment managers to file their 13F forms with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the market anticipates detailed disclosures on institutional engagements since the Bitcoin ETFs were <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/breaking-spot-bitcoin-etfs-approved-by-us-sec/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">launched on January 11</a>.</p>
<p>According to MacroScope, a notable crypto analyst, &#8220;these filings will start with a trickle next week, then pick up after that and run well into May,&#8221; hinting at a gradual revelation of institutional players involved in Bitcoin ETFs. “The most interesting names could come later in the filing process, since some funds like to wait as long as possible in order to not show their hand before the mid-May deadline,” <a href="https://twitter.com/MacroScope17/status/1772366841727373749" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">according</a> to the analyst.</p>

<p>These revelations have the potential to bolster the market sentiment significantly, enhancing Bitcoin&#8217;s market value as major financial players reveal their positions.</p>
#2 Aptos: Anticipation Builds Around DeFi DAYS Event
<p>As the DeFi DAYS event hosted by Aptos approaches from April 2 to 5, the crypto community is abuzz with speculation about a major announcement potentially involving a partnership with an asset management behemoth like BlackRock. As NewsBTC <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/all/why-blackrock-could-bet-on-this-rwa-token-crypto/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reported</a>, this speculation is not baseless; Aptos CEO Mo Shaikh&#8217;s previous tenure at BlackRock and strategic teasers have hinted at something significant on the horizon.</p>
<p>In a revealing post, Shaikh hinted at impactful discussions with major asset managers, stating, &#8220;I sat down with three of the world&#8217;s largest asset managers this week. A little preview&#8230;while the year started with ETFs, it will conclude with RWA on-chain en masse, growth in Asia and all using parallelisation on Aptos See you in Hong Kong.&#8221;</p>
<p>This statement suggests an ambitious vision for integrating real-world assets (RWA) with blockchain technology, potentially through Aptos. Adam Cader of Thala Labs further stirred the speculation pot by noting, &#8220;Something is cooking for Aptos.&#8221; He speculated that this could involve a collaboration with one of the world&#8217;s largest asset managers, highlighting BlackRock&#8217;s openness to crypto as a significant hint towards their possible involvement.</p>
#3 FET Merger: AI Crypto Projects Unite
<p>In a groundbreaking move, three leading AI crypto projects—Fetch.AI, SingularityNET, and Ocean Protocol—have <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ai-tokens-fetch-ai-agix-ocean-merger-surge-double-digits/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> a proposed merger into a new token, Artificial Superintelligence (ASI), aiming to forge a decentralized AI powerhouse last.</p>

<p>This collaborative effort, led by SingularityNET CEO Ben Goertzel and Fetch.ai CEO Humayun Sheikh, seeks to challenge the dominance of tech giants by leveraging blockchain&#8217;s potential in AI development. Starting tomorrow, April 2, the merger proposal awaits community approval, marking a significant step toward decentralized AI innovation.</p>

#4 Bitcoin Cash Halving: A Precursor to Price Rally?
<p>The Bitcoin Cash community is on the cusp of a significant milestone, with the impending block reward halving on April 2, 2024, at 20:32 UTC. This event, which slashes the mining reward from the current 6.25 BCH to 3.125 BCH per block, has historically been a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-halving-supply-shock-significant-heres-why/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">catalyst </a>for price increases due to the reduced rate of new coin generation.</p>
<p>In anticipation of this event, the price of BCH has surged, rallying 37% over the past week and achieving a 12% increase in just the last 24 hours alone.</p>
#5 Cosmos: Teasing Major Interchain Expansion
<p>Cosmos (ATOM) has intrigued the crypto sphere with an announcement scheduled for April 2 at 1 pm UTC, marking three years of its Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol and interchain expansion. This tease “3 years of IBC, 3 years of Interchain expansion” has sparked speculation about potential milestones or partnerships that could further solidify Cosmos&#8217; position in the blockchain ecosystem, emphasizing the importance of interconnectivity in the future of blockchain technology.</p>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。比特币的算力持续增长，显示出网络的强大和自信。尽管价格未大幅超过前高点，但算力翻了一番，表明网络有能力处理更大价值。4月2024年的减半可能导致一些矿工退出市场，但矿工仍然对未来价格表现充满信心。算力激增也增强了网络安全性，使其更加抵抗恶意攻击。这一发展值得密切关注，显示了比特币矿工社区内在健康和情绪。 <div>
<p>Bitcoin continues to defy expectations. While the price recently surpassed its November 2021 peak, the true story might lie beneath the surface – a record-breaking <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-hashrate-returns-to-new-ath/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">surge in hashrate</a>, the computational power securing the network. This unexpected development has analysts buzzing about potential bullish signals for the world&#8217;s leading cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>The hashrate, essentially the combined processing power of Bitcoin miners globally, has doubled in the past year. This stands in stark contrast to the price action, which has only marginally surpassed its previous all-time high.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Hashrate Surge: The &#8216;Money Container&#8217;</h2>
<p>CryptoQuant, a leading analytics platform, sees this as a positive imbalance. The increased hashrate suggests the network&#8217;s capacity to handle a much larger monetary value, potentially tripling its current worth.</p>
<p>This analogy of Bitcoin as a &#8220;container for money&#8221; highlights the underlying strength of the network. A chart showcased by CryptoQuant reveals a 30-month rally in key network activity metrics, indicating a robust and growing ecosystem.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">#Bitcoin</a> = Money container</p>
<p>Hashrate = Container size measure</p>
<p>Same price level as the previous ATH, but this container can now store three times more money. <a href="https://t.co/2i7waHL0M1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/2i7waHL0M1</a></p>
<p>— Ki Young Ju (@ki_young_ju) <a href="https://twitter.com/ki_young_ju/status/1774091713147281474?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">March 30, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>However, a significant event looms on the horizon – the April 2024 halving. This pre-programmed code reduction in miner rewards by 50% could force some miners out of the game.</p>
<p>After the halving, 3-7% of Bitcoin (BTC) miners may stop mining because the rewards will only be 3.125 BTC each block instead of 6.25 BTC.</p>
<p>The Bitcoin (BTC) hashrate increased by above 700 Ehashes per second at least four times in March 2024, according to CoinWarz data. To put things in perspective, it was hovering about 300–350 EH/s a year ago.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/7c99r1nr/" width="2475" /></p>

<p>The hashrate surge suggests miners remain confident. This unwavering commitment, even in the face of declining rewards, is seen as a strong vote of faith in Bitcoin&#8217;s future price trajectory. The increased processing power also bolsters network security, making it even more resistant to malicious attacks.</p>
<p>While the hashrate surge is undoubtedly a positive development, some experts advise caution. The rise could be partially attributed to advancements in mining hardware efficiency, not necessarily a direct reflection of price expectations. Additionally, the halving might still cause temporary price fluctuations as miners adjust to the new reward structure.</p>

<p>The cryptocurrency market is notoriously volatile, and past performance is no guarantee of future results. However, the ongoing hashrate boom paints a compelling picture. It suggests a network brimming with confidence, one where miners are actively investing in long-term infrastructure despite potential short-term setbacks. This dedication to securing the network could be a harbinger of good things to come for Bitcoin&#8217;s price.</p>
<p>The hashrate surge is a development worth watching closely, as it sheds light on the underlying health and sentiment within the Bitcoin mining community.</p>

<title>Ripple Ruling By Judge Torres Could Be ‘Thrown Out’: Fox Business Reporter</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-ruling-judge-torres-could-be-thrown-out/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-ruling-judge-torres-could-be-thrown-out/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。文章提到了Fox商业网络高级记者查尔斯·加斯帕里诺对瑞波公司从美国证券交易委员会（SEC）获得的有利裁决可能在更高级别司法审查中不会持续的可能性。加斯帕里诺提到了他在推特上表达的怀疑，认为联邦法官对托雷斯法官有利的裁决持怀疑态度。此外，文章还提到了在Coinbase对SEC的诉讼中，SEC获得了关键胜利，这可能对加密货币行业产生深远影响。文章还包括XRP社区对这些看法的回应。 <div>
<p>Fox Business Senior Correspondent Charles Gasparino has raised the possibility that the favorable ruling received by Ripple from Judge Analisa Torres against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) might not withstand higher judicial review. This speculation comes in the wake of a<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-future-clouded-by-coinbase-sec-ruling/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> divergent decision</a> in the Coinbase vs. SEC lawsuit, where the SEC secured a pivotal victory, challenging the notion that digital assets can skirt securities laws—a decision that may have far-reaching consequences for the crypto industry at large.</p>
<h2>Ripple Ruling To Be Overturned?</h2>
<p>Gasparino, utilizing his reach on X (formerly Twitter), has <a href="https://twitter.com/CGasparino/status/1774441346922664360" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">spotlighted</a> what appears to be a growing skepticism among federal judges towards Judge Torres&#8217; ruling in favor of Ripple. Specifically, he pointed out that &#8220;A reminder to the XRP community: So far TWO Fed judges including the one considered the ‘dean’ of corporate-law judiciary (Rakoff) have scoffed at arguments using Judge Torres&#8217; Ripple ruling as precedent because the ruling itself is so incoherent.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added that “no one can guarantee the ruling gets thrown out and XRP being declared an unregistered security, but the signs are there that her legal analysis is faulty.”</p>

<p>This skepticism was echoed in the legal community following Judge Katherine Polk Failla&#8217;s decision in the Coinbase vs. SEC case. He claimed that “securities lawyers” say the judge&#8217;s ruling against Coinbase “should be a warning to XRP holders that Judge Torres&#8217;s Ripple analysis is likely to be reversed by the federal courts.”</p>
<p>Failla&#8217;s ruling emphasized that &#8220;The ‘crypto’ nomenclature may be of recent vintage, but the challenged transactions fall comfortably within the framework that courts have used to identify securities for nearly eighty years,&#8221; effectively dismissing the application of Torres&#8217; Ripple ruling as a defense.</p>
<p>Gasparino highlighted the Judge in the Coinbase case a rejected Coinbase&#8217;s contention that Torres&#8217;s Ripple ruling supports its case to dismiss. Instead, Judge Failla cited the<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/terraform-labs-in-the-hot-seat-trial-begins/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> Rakoff analysis on Terraform</a>, which also rejected the Torres analysis.</p>

<p>This perspective gains further weight considering SEC Chair Gary Gensler&#8217;s hardline stance on cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum (ETH), suggesting a determined regulatory push that could see Torres&#8217; ruling challenged. “If Gary Gensler considers <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-not-security-sec-probe-a16z/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">ETH a security</a>, the SEC will stop at nothing in getting Torres&#8217;s weird half-baked Ripple ruling overturned in the appellate division, and he has a good shot doing so,” Gasparino remarked.</p>
<h2>XRP Community Responds</h2>
<p>The discourse has not gone without rebuttal from the XRP community. Jesse Hynes, a lawyer and staunch XRP supporter, <a href="https://twitter.com/CGasparino/status/1774512301585977528" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">criticized</a> the narrative being drawn from the Coinbase ruling, stating, &#8220;This is a really bad take lol. No real lawyer will take the decision on what was essentially a motion to dismiss and apply it to a SJ decision. The haters need to come up with better content.&#8221; This highlights a sentiment within the pro-XRP camp that the legal nuances of the case are being oversimplified or misunderstood.</p>
<p>Bill Morgan, another pro-XRP lawyer, directly challenged Gasparino&#8217;s interpretations, <a href="https://twitter.com/Belisarius2020/status/1774446891339763781" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">asking</a> for explicit references that would support the claims of judicial skepticism towards Judge Torres&#8217; decision: &#8220;To assist your readers, please point out the references in any decision of these two judges in which they ‘scoff’ at arguments based on the decision in SEC v Ripple. You are surely not talking about two motions to dismiss given the nature of such motions compared to a summary judgment decision.”</p>
<p>At press time, XRP traded at $0.61234.</p>

<title>Dogecoin Whales Fill Up Their Bags As Price Rallies – How Much DOGE Did They Buy?</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-whales-fill-up-their-bags-as-price-rallies/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-whales-fill-up-their-bags-as-price-rallies/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章提到了上周DOGE取得的成功，包括价格上涨和交易量增加。报告显示大额交易者购买了价值280亿美元的DOGE，并且鲸鱼持仓量不断增加。DOGE目前正在面临来自鲸鱼的大宗购买，价格在短期内看涨。有望突破0.22美元阻力位，最终可能达到1美元，但还需警惕高达0.35美元的大量持有者。 <div>
<p>Last week was a particularly good week for DOGE. The meme coin experienced a surge in trading volume during the week that allowed it to successfully surpass the $0.22 price mark for the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-price-breaks-new-3-year-high-here-are-factors-that-could-drive-the-price-to-1/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">first time since November 2021</a>. This spike saw the price of DOGE increasing by as much as 33% during the week, outperforming the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-shark-and-whales/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">likes of Bitcoin</a> and other large market-cap cryptocurrencies. </p>

<p>Interestingly, the price surge was on the back of increased activity from whales, as indicated by on-chain data. The increased activity led to an increased accumulation trend from this cohort of traders, as noted by crypto analyst Ali Martinez. According to the analyst, Dogecoin whales purchased 1.40 billion DOGE over the past two weeks, worth around $280 million. </p>
<h2><b>Dogecoin Whales Filling Up Their Bags</b></h2>
<p>According to the Santiment chart <a href="https://x.com/ali_charts/status/1773603033949110698?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">shared by Ali Martinez</a> on social media, whale wallets holding between 10 million to 100 million DOGE tokens have constantly been increasing their holdings since March 15. This accumulation trend led to the whales increasing their total holdings by 1.40 billion DOGE to a total of 16.7 billion DOGE at the time the metric was shared. </p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-290869" height="340" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_7cbb28.png?resize=666%2C340" width="666" /></p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that this accumulation, worth around $280 million, is the highest recorded in a two-week period since Dogecoin&#8217;s shot to mainstream popularity in the 2021 bull market.</p>
<h2><strong> What’s Next For DOGE?</strong></h2>
<p>The chart shared by Martinez showed that the increase in whale accumulation largely corresponded with an <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-doge-payments-x/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">increase in the price of DOGE</a>. This is a recurring trend among cryptocurrencies, as crypto whales are generally known to move the market. At the same time, Dogecoin saw a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/dogecoin-2/dogecoin-open-interest-hits-record-2-2-billion-whats-next-for-doge-price/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">surge in open interest</a>, setting a new record of $2.2 billion.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/Tfxfyhb9/" width="1835" /></p>

<p>DOGE has since reversed by 7% since its foray into the $0.22 price level, although still up by 18.9% in the past seven days. According to CoinMarketCap, at the time of writing, DOGE is trading at $0.2064 with a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-shiba-inu-ethereum/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">market capitalization</a> of $29.6 billion. A continued accumulation from the whales could lead to Dogecoin resuming the price spike in the new week. </p>
<p>With new money pouring in and whales making big buys, the short-term outlook for Dogecoin looks positive. As <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-price-breaks-new-3-year-high-here-are-factors-that-could-drive-the-price-to-1/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reported by NewsBTC,</a> various factors point to DOGE reaching the $1 mark before the end of the current bull market phase. </p>
<p>However, the meme coin now faces a major resistance at $0.22. A successful breakout of this price resistance could give Dogecoin a clear path to <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-enters-new-trend-set-to-drive-price-to-0-3-analyst/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">$0.3</a>5. </p>

<p>According to data from <a href="https://app.intotheblock.com/coin/DOGE/deep-dive?group=financials&amp;chart=inAndOut" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">IntoTheBlock</a>, around 602,000 addresses purchased DOGE at an average price of $0.35 and still waiting to break even. This remains a key price level to consider as a break-even could lead to a potential sell-off from some of these addresses.</p>

<title>Solana Surging Ahead Of Ethereum In This Particular Metric</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/solana-surging-ahead-of-ethereum-in-this-metric/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/solana-surging-ahead-of-ethereum-in-this-metric/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章指出，尽管Solana难以突破200美元，但在链上数据显示SOL仍然强劲。Solana区块链处理稳定币交易量超过以太坊，尤其在过去一周。最近，Solana价格上涨，并达到195美元，显示强劲的上涨势头。然而，有41万SOL代币即将进入市场，可能增加卖压。交易活动表明，Solana正处于道路上，走向200美元。 <div>
<p>Recent market dynamics have seen Solana struggling to break above the $200 mark. A notable bearish factor among these market fundamentals is the recent reports of the estate of bankrupt cryptocurrency exchange <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-founder-sam-bankman-fried-gets-25-years-in-jail/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">FTX </a>selling its $7.65 billion worth of Solana at a 68% discount to its current market price.</p>

<p>However, on-chain data indicates SOL is still going on strong, particularly in the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/stablecoins-steal-the-spotlight-150-billion-market-cap-122-billion-daily-trades/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">stablecoin sector</a>. Stablecoin transfers on the Solana chain reveal the blockchain steadily processing more transactions than Ethereum every day, registering $411.2 billion more in trading volume in the past week. </p>
<h2><strong>On-Chain Data Highlights Solana&#8217;s Growing Stablecoin Usage</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://app.artemis.xyz/stablecoins" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Data from Artemis</a>, a crypto on-chain analytics platform, has highlighted the growing usage of stablecoins on Solana. According to on-chain data, daily stablecoin trading volume on the blockchain has outpaced that of Ethereum for almost the entirety of March, particularly starting on March 9. The difference in trading volume was further aggravated in the past week, as noted by Artemis in a social media post.</p>
<p>For example, Solana registered $97.5 billion in stablecoin trading volume yesterday March 30, compared to a $9.3 billion volume on the Ethereum blockchain. The highest difference came on March 28, with the altcoin registering $112.9 billion in trading volume, $95.3 billion more than Ethereum&#8217;s $17.6 billion. Consequently, Solana now contributes over 80% of the stablecoin market trading volume.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-290830" height="351" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_90f3a5.png?resize=627%2C351" width="627" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/artemis__xyz/status/1774157161356255565?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">According to Artemis</a>, most of the volume can be attributed to MEV bots and Phoenix, a decentralized crypto exchange. MEV (maximum extractable value) bots are programmable software built to scan blockchain networks for transactions that have the potential to generate profits and then automatically carry out those transactions. These bots have been particularly active on the Solana blockchain, constantly scanning for arbitrage opportunities for profit. </p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/Cj1vNWaZ/" width="1835" /></p>

<h2><b>SOL To 200?</b></h2>
<p>The Solana ecosystem is expanding quickly, as evidenced by price surges and on-chain metrics. SOL, Solana&#8217;s native cryptocurrency, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-sol-continues-to-soar-how-high-can-it-go/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">witnessed considerable growth</a> in the past seven days to reverse last week&#8217;s downtrend. </p>
<p>At the time of writing, SOL is trading at $195, up by 13% in the past seven days and reaching as high as $198. The price of Solana had already touched $208 on March 18. However, the bullish momentum wasn&#8217;t enough to keep the price appreciation going, as it dropped to as low as $167 on March 20. </p>

<p>Fundamentals point to a roadblock before reaching the $200 mark again. The roadblock is in tune of 41 million SOL tokens about to hit the market from the estate of FTX. Such a selloff could increase the selling pressure, leading to a price reversal. Trading activity, on the other hand, indicates that there is a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-sol-breaks-through-key-resistance-analyst-forecasts-250-price-target/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">greater possibility of price appreciation</a> and that Solana is on the route to <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-sol-continues-to-soar-how-high-can-it-go/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reaching $200 and beyond</a>.</p>

<title>DOGE Day Afternoon: Open Interest Breaks $2 Billion, Setting New Records</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/doge-open-interest-breaks-2-billion/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/doge-open-interest-breaks-2-billion/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章展示了DOGE加密货币近期的活跃度，包括期货市场活动激增和技术指标看涨，预示着价格可能会爆发。DOGE期货持仓量达到创纪录的20多亿美元，显示市场活动明显增加。同时，DOGE资金费率保持积极，暗示市场看涨情绪。关于DOGE可能与X社交媒体平台整合支付的传言也增强了积极趋势。尽管市场仍然不稳定，但DOGE最近的表现表明其有望在金融世界中建立持久影响力。 <div>
<p>DOGE, the internet&#8217;s favorite memecoin, is back in the spotlight. Recent data reveals a surge in futures market activity, coupled with bullish technical indicators, suggesting a potential price explosion on the horizon.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.coinglass.com/currencies/DOGE" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Data from Coinglass</a> reveals a record high of over $2 billion in DOGE futures open interest, signifying a significant increase in market activity. This suggests that traders are placing more bets on the future price of the memecoin, with many likely anticipating a price rise.</p>
<h2>DOGE Flexes Its Muscles With Big Numbers</h2>
<p>Further bolstering the bullish case, DOGE funding rates have remained positive since the broader market rally began in October 2023, despite a temporary price dip in mid-March. Positive funding rates indicate that traders holding long positions (betting on a price increase) are being paid by those holding short positions (betting on a price decrease). This dynamic suggests a market bias towards a price appreciation for the crypto.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-290858" height="291" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_236e10.png?resize=1024%2C291" width="1024" /></p>

<p>Analyzing the data reveals that the majority of this interest is spread around a number of significant cryptocurrency trading platforms, with Binance leading the way with nearly $640 million, Bybit coming in second with $623 million, and BingX coming in third with $300 million. The distribution of interest on these platforms demonstrates the growing fervor and trust that investors are putting in Dogecoin.</p>
<p>The latest rumors about the possible integration of <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOGE</a> and cryptocurrency payments into X (previously Twitter) are partially responsible for this positive trend. There has been a lot of conjecture about the integration of DOGE into X&#8217;s payment systems, according to recent reports. Elon Musk&#8217;s well-known love for Dogecoin—he frequently refers to it as his favorite coin—has added gasoline to this rumor.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/MtnfmHSR/" width="2475" /></p>

<p>The confluence of these factors has instilled a sense of optimism among investors and traders. The cryptocurrency is currently trading at $0.21, representing a 30% increase over the past week. This positive sentiment has many anticipating an extended price rally for the meme coin.</p>
<p>However, amidst the excitement, experts advise caution. The cryptocurrency market remains notoriously volatile and unpredictable. While the current market conditions and technical indicators suggest a favorable outlook for DOGE in the near term, unforeseen events or broader market shifts could easily disrupt the current trajectory.</p>

<p>Despite the inherent risks, Dogecoin&#8217;s recent performance underscores the evolving nature of the financial landscape. Even digital assets born out of internet jokes can, under the right circumstances, garner significant traction and influence within the market.</p>
<p>As Dogecoin continues to capture the attention of both crypto enthusiasts and mainstream investors, its future performance will be closely watched to see if it can defy its meme-coin origins and establish itself as a legitimate player in the ever-changing world of finance.</p>

<title>12-Year Bitcoin Slumber Ends: Whales Signal Stormy Seas Ahead</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/12-year-bitcoin-slumber-ends-details/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/12-year-bitcoin-slumber-ends-details/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。比特币最近飙升至创纪录的73,000美元，引发了市场的兴奋和忧虑。12年来一直沉睡的比特币鲸鱼最近转移了他们的资产，引发了对可能大规模抛售的担忧。专家认为，美国比特币ETF的涌入可能会加剧鲸鱼活动，而鲸鱼们则可能在这个高价位锁定利润或者调整持仓。由于未来市场走势不确定，投资者应谨慎对待。 <div>
<p>The recent stratospheric rise of Bitcoin, reaching a new all-time high of $73,000, has sent ripples of excitement and trepidation through the crypto world. While some celebrate the digital gold&#8217;s record-breaking ascent, others watch with bated breath as long-dormant Bitcoin whales – entities holding massive amounts – begin to awaken from their slumber.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin Whale Rises From Hibernation</h2>
<p>One such whale recently emerged from the depths, a digital leviathan that hadn&#8217;t breached the surface for nearly 12 years. This behemoth, with a treasure trove of 500 BTCs initially acquired in 2012 for a measly $4,000, has transferred its entire stash, now<a href="https://blockstream.info/tx/2c8960feef2c66a8960f058cef11f42ba883db53e3287f085bffd29d663fc98a" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> valued at a staggering $35 million</a>, to multiple new addresses. The resurfacing of this whale, and others like it, has cast a long shadow over the market, raising concerns about a potential fire sale on the horizon.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-290833" height="425" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_b4e8a1.png?resize=1024%2C425" width="1024" /></p>

<p>The specter of a mass sell-off looms large, particularly with the upcoming Bitcoin halving event scheduled for April 19th. Historically, these <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/why-bitcoin-halving-could-bring-uncertainty-to-mining-industry/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">halvings</a>, which cut the amount of new bitcoin entering circulation in half, have been linked to price drops. However, some experts believe the market has already factored in this event, mitigating the risk of a significant price plunge.</p>
<p>Memories of earlier this year are still fresh in investor minds. When <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bitcoin</a> reached the $60,000 level, a colossal sell-off from a Satoshi-era miner wallet sent shockwaves through the market.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/gPhETWqD/" width="2475" /></p>

<p>The price plummeted from a dizzying high of $69,000 down to a sobering $58,000 in a single day. Fortunately, the surge in demand from newly launched Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) provided a much-needed lifeline, propelling Bitcoin to its current record heights.</p>
<h2>US Bitcoin ETFs: Catalyst For Increased Whale Activity</h2>
<p>Analysts posit that the recent surge in whale transactions points towards a sell-side liquidity crisis, potentially fueled by the influx of new money from these US-based Bitcoin ETFs. This sentiment is bolstered by the overall increase in large-scale transactions since Bitcoin surpassed its previous peak.</p>

<p>This flurry of activity from the slumbering giants of the crypto world suggests a potential repositioning of their holdings. Whales may be strategically maneuvering their assets in anticipation of future market movements, or simply taking advantage of the current high prices to lock in some profit.</p>
<p>The true intentions behind these reactivations remain shrouded in mystery. However, one thing is certain: the awakening of the whales adds another layer of uncertainty to the already volatile Bitcoin market.</p>
<p>Investors should tread cautiously, closely monitoring market sentiment and whale movements in the coming weeks, particularly as the halving event approaches. The coming days may reveal whether these colossal creatures are preparing to feast or merely seeking a more comfortable corner of the digital ocean.</p>

<title>Tornado Cash Co-Founder Seeks To Dismiss Charges – Details</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。Tornado Cash的联合创始人Roman Storm因涉嫌洗钱和违反IEEPA法案而被美国司法部指控。他的律师提交了一份文件，声称指控有致命缺陷，包括援引第一修正案保护法。辩护律师表示，Tornado Cash不属于“货币传输业务”，而Storm也无意用该平台进行非法活动。辩护还指出，Storm创建Tornado Cash是在行使第一修正案权利。加密社区支持Tornado Cash的开发者，包括以太坊开发者Preston Van Loon。 <div>
<p>The co-founder of Tornado Cash, Roman Storm, has filed a motion to dismiss the charges levied against him by the US Department of Justice (DOJ), Southern District of New York. In a petition <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.604938/gov.uscourts.nysd.604938.30.0.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">submitted on March 29</a>, Storm&#8217;s lawyers have laid out several arguments to secure the freedom of the client, including invoking the First Amendment Protection Act.</p>

<h2>DOJ Charges Are &#8220;Fatally Flawed,” Storm’s Lawyers Say</h2>
<p>On August 23, 2023, the US State Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Merrick B. Garland, alongside key staff of the DOJ and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/tornado-cash-founders-charged-money-laundering-and-sanctions-violations" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> an indictment against Storm and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/tornado-cash-co-founde-to-us-sanctions-list/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Roman Semenov</a>, two of the co-founders of popular crypto mixer platform Tornado Cash.</p>
<p>The DOJ stated it was charging both individuals for their alleged role in the “creation, operation, and promotion” of Tornado cash which it claims has functioned as a platform for the money laundering of over $1 billion, including hundreds of millions of dollars for notorious North Korean hackers known as the Lazarus Group. </p>
<p>In its lawsuit statement, the DOJ accused both defendants of one count of conspiracy to commit money laundering, one count of conspiracy to violate the International Economic Emergency Powers Acts (IEEPA), and one count of conspiracy to operate an unlicensed money-transmitting business.</p>
<p>Analyzing these allegations, the lawyers for Storm, who has since been arrested, have described the DOJ’s petition as “fatally flawed” and are seeking a total dismissal of all accusations. To begin, the defense states in its motion that Tornado Cash cannot be categorized as a “money transmitting business” as the platform charged no fees for its services and allowed users to keep total control of their digital assets in any transaction. </p>
<p>Furthermore, Storm&#8217;s lawyers also expressed that the charge of a money laundering conspiracy was rather invalid as the defendant never had an intention to conduct such a crime using Tornado Cash, nor did he have an agreement with any party or entity that has used the crypto mixer platform for any illicit purposes. </p>
<p>Finally, the motion challenges the alleged conspiracy to willfully breach the IEEPA by stating that Storm’s involvement in the creation of Tornado Cash is part of the defendant expressing his First Amendment rights. The defense argues that the writing of computer code to transmit information is referred to as a form of speech (informational materials exemption) which falls under the First Amendment Protections according to US laws.
</p>

<h2>Crypto Community Stands Strong With Tornado Cash Co-Founders</h2>
<p>The indictment of Roman Storm and other Tornado Cash developers, including Alexey Pertsev, who is <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/tornado-cash-founder-charged-for-allegedly-aiding-1-2-billion-in-laundered-funds/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">currently facing trial</a> in the Netherlands for similar reasons, has attracted a lot of attention as some crypto enthusiasts argue that developers should not be responsible for the individual use of their projects. </p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As Bitcoinist earlier <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/tornado-cash-founder-charged-for-allegedly-aiding-1-2-billion-in-laundered-funds/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">reported,</a>  prominent supporters of the Tornado Cash co-founders include Ethereum developer Preston Van Loon and the Blockchain Association in Washington. It can be assumed these cases hold significant weight on the future of blockchain technology as potential victories for the government could discourage developers&#8217; participation in the crypto ecosystem.</p>

<title>Prisma Finance Hacker Continues On-Chain Tirade Following $11 Million Heist</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/prisma-finance-hacker-on-chain-11-million-heist/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/prisma-finance-hacker-on-chain-11-million-heist/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。文章讨论了以太坊网络上去中心化借贷协议Prisma Finance遭受一起价值1160万美元的闪电贷攻击。攻击者通过转移一部分盗窃所得到加密混合器Tornado Cash。攻击者声称自己是“白帽黑客”，并要求协议团队举行在线新闻发布会。文章还指出Prisma Finance可能在防范漏洞方面存在不足，并对DeFi行业的安全问题提出了关注。报告显示，2024年第一季度加密货币行业的损失由于黑客攻击和欺诈活动减少了23%，DeFi协议仍然是黑客的主要目标。 <div>
<p>On Thursday, March 28, a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-hacks-value-saw-97-in-february-investigator/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">hack occurred on Prisma Finance</a>, a decentralized lending protocol on the Ethereum network. The exploiter carted away about 3,257.7 ETH (equivalent to $11.6 million) via a flash loan attack on the protocol.</p>
<p>On Friday, March 29, the Prisma Finance hacker transferred some of the proceeds from the theft to crypto mixer Tornado Cash in multiple transactions. According to <a href="https://x.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/1773620491212743051?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">PeckShield</a>, $2.7 million in ETH was moved in one transaction and $3.8 million in another.</p>
<p>What’s most interesting is the hacker sent an on-chain message barely six hours after the attack through one of the addresses linked to the heist, claiming they are a “white hat hacker.” And the exploiter has continued to send on-chain messages to Prisma Finance&#8217;s team since the theft occurred.</p>
<h2>Was Prisma Finance &#8216;Sloppy&#8217; In The $11.6 Million Loss?</h2>
<p>In a <a href="https://etherscan.io/idm?addresses=0x2d413803a6ec3cb1ed1a93bf90608f63b157507a,0xd8531a94100f15af7521a7b6e724ac4959e0a025&amp;type=1" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">series of on-chain messages,</a> the exploiter criticized the team behind Prisma Finance for not catching the loophole in the protocol, which allowed the exploit to take place in the first place. The hacker also requested an online press conference in which the protocol’s team would reveal their identity while apologizing and appreciating their users and investors.</p>

<p>The attacker said in the message:</p>
<blockquote><p>During that session, you must specifically present the mistake you made, which party audited the smart contract, and your plan to improve security in the future (what you would do before deploying a new contract, how you react when something you don&#8217;t expect comes, etc.).</p></blockquote>
<p>The hacker also emphasized <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/surge-in-north-korean-crypto-attacks-hacks-2023/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">the need for users to be more careful in the decentralized finance</a> (DeFi) industry and when interacting with various smart contracts. “I look forward to your online conference. After it happens, the amount I would keep and the amount that I can send to you would be discussed (stay assured, most of it would be returned), and the notes would be sent to your email,” the hacker added.</p>
<p>A particular accusation that caught the eye in the hacker’s latest message is that “no professional developers can easily make that mistake.” The attacker said that if they had not exploited the loophole in the smart contract, it could have been the “perfect backdoor” for the protocol’s team.</p>
<p>As of this writing, Prisma Finance has paused all operations on its protocol. Meanwhile, the total value locked (TVL) on the platform stands at about $85.65 million, down by 61% since the hack.</p>
<h2>Crypto Hack Losses Witness Decline In 2024 Q1: Report</h2>
<p>In a new <a href="https://downloads.ctfassets.net/t3wqy70tc3bv/34mVQUo6KAMcKF7rHyRdNM/d6c8710283abad55ec786c56f94eb3d1/Immunefi__Crypto_Losses_in_Q1_2024.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">report by Immunefi</a>, the cryptocurrency industry suffered relatively fewer losses due to hacks and scams in the first quarter of 2024. Compared to 2023’s first quarter, the value lost to exploits and cyber attacks is down by 23%.</p>
<p><img alt="Prisma Finance" class="aligncenter wp-image-290815 size-large" height="578" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screen-Shot-2024-03-31-at-06.50.43.png?resize=980%2C578" width="980" /></p>


<p>According to the blockchain security firm, approximately $336.3 million was lost to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-scams-persist-exit-scams-hacks-cost-crypto-sector-160-million-in-february/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">hacks and scams in the first quarter of 2024</a>. Specifically, Immunefi identified 46 hacking incidents and 15 cases of fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the report revealed that DeFi protocols are still the primary targets for cyber attackers, accounting for all the reported hack incidents in Q1. Notably, the cross-chain protocol Orbit Bridge suffered the largest exploit in the past three months, losing about $82 million on January 1.</p>

<title>Worldcoin Earns Approval From Ethereum Founder For Privacy Initiatives</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/worldcoin-earns-approval-from-ethereum-founder/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/worldcoin-earns-approval-from-ethereum-founder/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章讨论了Worldcoin提供数字身份和加密货币以换取虹膜扫描的计划，以及在技术进步和数据隐私之间的冲突。以太坊联合创始人Vitalik Buterin赞扬Worldcoin的隐私措施，并认为他们在隐私保护方面优于传统的中心化身份验证解决方案。然而，葡萄牙数据监管机构暂停了90天的生物识别数据收集，表示对公民数据权利的严重担忧。文章提出了关于虹膜扫描数据长期安全性、Worldcoin的匿名化技术以及替代验证方法的问题。文章强调了Worldcoin需要在数据安全和匿名化技术方面展示其承诺的重要性。 <div>
<p>A battle between technological advancement and data privacy is brewing around Worldcoin, a project offering digital identity and cryptocurrency in exchange for iris scans.</p>
<p>While Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin applauds Worldcoin&#8217;s efforts to strengthen privacy measures, Portugal&#8217;s data regulator has thrown a wrench into the program by halting biometric data collection for 90 days.</p>

<p>Worldcoin&#8217;s system hinges on a unique approach. Instead of traditional signup methods like name and address, users submit iris scans to create a digital ID.</p>
<p>This anonymity is incentivized by offering free WLD cryptocurrency tokens. The program has garnered over 4.6 million users globally, but concerns about data privacy have dogged it from the start.</p>
<h2>Buterin Praises Worldcoin In Addressing Privacy Issues</h2>
<p>Buterin, a crypto heavyweight, seems to stand by Worldcoin. He recently commended the team&#8217;s &#8220;data-minimal&#8221; approach and their commitment to addressing privacy critiques. He believes they outperform traditional, centralized authentication solutions in terms of privacy protection.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">IMO they actually have been doing quite a good job of taking the privacy critiques seriously and designing their system to be more and more data-minimal. Modern cryptography is truly amazing.</p>
<p>— vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) <a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1773540073239183536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">March 29, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>However, regulators aren&#8217;t convinced. Portugal joins Kenya in<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/argentina-probes-worldcoin-operations/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> raising red flags.</a> The Portuguese National Commission for Data Protection (CNPD) expressed fear of &#8220;serious harm&#8221; to citizens&#8217; data rights.</p>
<p>This move comes after over 300,000 Portuguese individuals entrusted their iris data to Worldcoin. The CNPD cited the high risk associated with storing biometric information as justification for the suspension.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/L8C5xoTN/" width="2475" /></p>

<p>The situation raises several questions. Firstly, how secure is iris scan data in the long run? Breaches of such sensitive information could have severe consequences.</p>
<p>Secondly, are Worldcoin&#8217;s anonymization techniques robust enough? Even anonymized data can potentially be linked back to individuals, especially with advancements in facial recognition technology.</p>
<p>Finally, could alternative verification methods achieve similar goals without compromising user privacy?</p>
<h2>Worldcoin: The Road Ahead</h2>

<p>Worldcoin&#8217;s approach presents undeniable benefits. By eliminating traditional identification methods, they potentially create a more inclusive financial system, particularly for the unbanked population.</p>
<p>But these benefits come at a cost. The program hinges on trust, and the onus lies on Worldcoin to demonstrate their commitment to user privacy.</p>
<p>Moving forward, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/worldcoin-up-46-in-wake-of-altman-board-reunion/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Worldcoin</a> must navigate a tightrope. They need to convince regulators and users that their data is safe and anonymization techniques are foolproof.</p>
<p>Transparency about data storage practices and potential risks is crucial. Additionally, exploring alternative verification methods that minimize privacy risks could be a strategic move.</p>

<title>Here Are The Top Crypto Predictions Following The Bitcoin Halving In April 2024</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的<br />随着比特币减半事件的临近，加密社区将密切关注预测的实现情况。一些人认为比特币价格可能上涨到100万美元，而其他分析师给出的预测则更保守。同时，关注Solana和ADA等热门替代币的发展，以及XRP在减半后的表现。存在预测价格上涨的乐观情绪，但也有对价格下跌的担忧。 <div>
<p>The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bull-market-glassnode/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin Halving</a> event, which will cut miners&#8217; rewards in half, is set to take place in mid-April. Once that happens, the crypto community will have its eyes on <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-supply-shock-57-of-btc-hasnt-moved-2-years/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">specific predictions</a> that have been projected to be actualized after the Halving event. </p>

<h2><b>Where Is Bitcoin Headed After The Halving?</b></h2>
<p>Crypto analysts have given varying opinions on the future trajectory of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/why-bitcoin-halving-could-bring-uncertainty-to-mining-industry/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">flagship crypto</a> after the Halving takes place. <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-reach-1-million/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Samson Mow’s prediction</a> stands out from the rest, considering that he believes Bitcoin could rise to $1 million this year. If that is to happen, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-crashed-65000/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bitcoin’s price</a> would have to begin showing tremendous upside post-halving. </p>
<p>Besides Mow, some other crypto analysts have given bullish price predictions for Bitcoin, although not as ambitious as Mow’s. One of them is Tom Dunleavy, Partner and Chief Investment Officer (CIO), who <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-100000-cardano-dead/#:~:text=Why%20Cardano%20Is%20Dead,non%2Dexistent%E2%80%9D%20on%20it." rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">predicted</a> that Bitcoin would rise to $100,000 after the Halving takes place. </p>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-could-be-poised-for-a-huge-breakout-fundstrats-tom-lee/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Tom Lee</a>, Managing Partner and Head of Research at Fundstrat Global Advisors is another person who has high hopes for Bitcoin’s price post-halving. In February, he <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/fundstrat-exec-bitcoin-150000/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">predicted</a> that Bitcoin could rise to $150,000, thanks partly to the Bitcoin Halving. The common belief among these analysts is that Bitcoin’s supply will shrink, causing its value to appreciate.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some have projected a bearish outlook for Bitcoin after the Halving event. This includes JPMorgan, which <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-price-correct-after-halving/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">has predicted</a> that Bitcoin could drop to as low as $42,000 once the event occurs. They believe this price drop could happen due to increased production costs and mining difficulties. </p>
<p>In one of his analyses, Crypto expert Rekt Capital <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-to-50000-or-80000/#:~:text=%2480%2C000%20Could%20Be%20Next%20For%20Bitcoin&amp;text=However%2C%20a%20correction%20could%20quickly,be%20encouraging%20during%20that%20period." rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">also suggested</a> that Bitcoin isn’t exactly going to have a smooth ride up once the Halving takes place. Specifically, he mentioned that Bitcoin would enter a “multi-month re-accumulation” after the Bitcoin Halving, which could last up to five months.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/CENfi4wN/" width="1835" /></p>

<h2><b>Altcoins To Keep An Eye On</b></h2>
<p>Solana (SOL) is generating much attention, especially with the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-meme-coins-myro-wif/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">meme coin frenzy</a> on the Solana network. This has caused SOL’s price to skyrocket in recent weeks and has increased optimism that it won’t be long before it <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-headed-to-100/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">surpasses its all-time high</a> (ATH) of $260. Moreover, crypto analysts like Jake Gagain have <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-price-will-climb-to-750/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">predicted</a> that the crypto token will still rise to as high as $750. </p>
<p>The crypto community will also be monitoring ADA closely. Before now, Dan Gambardello, the founder of Crypto Capital Venture, <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">had explained</a> that ADA historically lags for a while before it eventually takes off in the bull run. Gambardello had also <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/ada/cardano-ada-price-to-11/#:~:text=According%20to%20him%2C%20this%20is,the%20next%20Bitcoin%20Halving%20event." rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">predicted</a> that ADA would begin its run to $11 once the Halving takes place.  </p>

<p>XRP, like ADA, has had an <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-price-action-legal-expert/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">unimpressive price action</a> despite the broader crypto market enjoying significant gains year-to-date (YTD). However, with crypto analyst <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Egrag Crypto</a> predicting that XRP <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">could rise to $27</a>, the token will be another altcoin to keep an eye on post-Halving. </p>

<title>Fox Journalists Says XRP Won’t Make You Rich, Here’s Why</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-wont-make-you-rich/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-wont-make-you-rich/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。文章提到美国记者对XRP和Ripple面临的金融风险发出警告，指出美国SEC主席Gary Gensler可能会挑战XRP的分类，导致投资者可能不会从中获利。文章还提到SEC对XRP的裁决可能会被推翻，给投资者带来更大损失。另外，文章还谈到了BlackRock拒绝批准XRP ETF的消息，强调XRP的价值受限。 <div>
<p><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/crypto/crypto-market-bloodbath-if-ripple-loses-to-sec/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Charles Gasparino</a>, an American journalist and a senior correspondent for Fox Business, has delivered a sobering message to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-judge-allows-us-xrp-investors-pursue-claims/">XRP investors</a>, warning them of the financial risks associated with XRP as Ripple navigates its <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/pro-xrp-lawyer-ripple-sec-settlement-odds-40/">regulatory battle </a>with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</p>
<h2>Gary Gensler Could Challenge XRP Ruling</h2>
<p>In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, Gasparino <a href="https://x.com/cgasparino/status/1773308680416452786?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">discussed</a> the current regulatory situation between <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-lawsuit-ripple-sec-agreement-schedule/">Ripple and the US SEC</a>. The Fox Business journalist disclosed that the SEC government could potentially overturn the previous <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-judge-deems-xrp-sale-non-investment-contract/">ruling made by Judge Analisa Torres</a> regarding XRP.</p>

<p>According to Gasparino, if the current chair of the US SEC, Gary Gensler, were to classify <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-in-the-hot-seat-sec-security-label-looms/">Ethereum</a>, the second largest cryptocurrency, as a security, then the government would spare no effort to reverse the ruling on XRP from July 2023. Back then, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/breaking-ripple-win-as-judge-rejects-secs-appeal/">Judge Torres</a> had ruled that programmatic sales of XRP should not be considered a security, granting the Ripple team a partial victory over the SEC. </p>
<p>The Fox Business journalist asserted that if this scenario were to unfold, then XRP investors would “probably not get rich on XRP.” He revealed that investors could get even poorer depending on how things unfold. This is because if the SEC manages to overturn the Ripple ruling, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-cto-xrp-price-amm-feature/">XRP may see its price plummeting</a> once again, with almost no chance of a comeback for years.  </p>
<p>While Gasparino has expressed a strong belief that the US SEC has a great chance of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-judge-torres-approves-interlocutory-appeal/">reversing the Ripple ruling</a>, Gensler has yet to offer clear guidance on how Ethereum should be classified. </p>
<p>The SEC chair has <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/house-gop-pressures-sec-to-clarify-ethereum/">refrained from categorically declaring whether Ethereum is deemed a security or not</a>. This lack of clarity has heightened uncertainty surrounding Ethereum’s classification, potentially exacerbating regulatory uncertainty within the digital asset ecosystem. </p>
<h2>Fox Journalist Echoes BlackRock’s XRP ETF Rejection</h2>
<p>In another X post, Gasparino <a href="https://x.com/cgasparino/status/1773311140254150679?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reiterated</a> BlackRock’s stance on an <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-file-for-an-xrp-etf/">XRP Exchange Traded Fund (ETF)</a>, highlighting that the asset management company is unlikely to approve an XRP ETF.</p>

<p>The Fox Business journalist conveyed the statement to XRP investors and supporters, emphasizing that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-file-for-an-xrp-etf-2/">BlackRock</a>’s rejection of an XRP ETF was “sad”. Gasparino also <a href="https://x.com/cgasparino/status/1773475306906542472?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">criticized</a> several XRP enthusiasts, stressing that the cryptocurrency had limited value. </p>
<p>Currently, BlackRock’s position regarding the potential issuance of an XRP ETF remains uncertain. Despite denying <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-xrp-etf-filing/">rumors</a> of planning to launch an XRP ETF in 2023, the asset management company has not definitively ruled out the possibility, instead, it is maintaining its primary focus on its <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-gobbles-up-nearly-196000-btc/">Spot Bitcoin ETF</a>.</p>

<div> <br /><br />摘要: 这些信息是消极的。<br />美国法官裁定驳回了Custodia银行对获得美联储主账户和成员资格的要求。该数字资产银行起诉美联储是因为拖延决定是否授予其主账户。然而，明年1月美联储批准了Custodia银行向美国中央银行系统提交这些请求的资格。银行认为，没有主账户，将无法像其他银行那样直接接入美联储并提供类似的资产托管服务。然而美国法官认为，美联储保留了授予或拒绝主账户请求的自主权。最终判决支持了美联储堪萨斯城分行，裁定数字资产银行无权获得其请求的Order of Mandamus。 <div>
<p>A United States judge has ruled against Custodia Bank’s claim to membership and a master account with the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/us-crypto-industry-major-victory-federal-reserve/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Federal Reserve</a>. The digital asset bank had initially sued the Fed in 2022 for delaying a decision on whether or not to grant the bank a master account.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-friendly-custodia-bank-faces-setback/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Federal Reserve rejected the bank’s membership and master account applications</a> in January 2023. This move came after confirming Custodia&#8217;s eligibility to submit these requests to the US central banking system.</p>
<h2>Why Custodia Bank Applied For Fed Master Account And Membership</h2>
<p>On Friday, March 29, Judge Scott Skavdahl rejected Custodia Bank’s bid to obtain a Federal Reserve master account, according to a filing submitted to the United States District Court of Wyoming. </p>
<p>The master account is referred to as “a bank account for banks,” which grants deposit institutions access to the Fed’s services, including its payments system.</p>

<p>As disclosed in the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/e4eik55fl6gfapyb37ctc/show_temp-13.pdf?rlkey=2gh2k2o1emjsd7c4zvldbkq0p&amp;dl=0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">March 29 court filing</a>, Custodia argued that it won&#8217;t be able to directly access the Federal Reserve and offer similar custodial services for crypto assets as some other banking institutions currently do without a master account.</p>
<p>“Without a master account, if Custodia is able to operate at all, it is as a second-class citizen, relegated to dependency on and fealty to an intermediary bank (which does have a master account),” the digital asset claimed.</p>
<p>The court document revealed that Custodia applied to the Board of Governors for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-drop-short-term-roar-fed-slash-rates/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">membership in the Federal Reserve</a> in August 2021. According to the bank, a membership would subject it to oversight and regulation by the Fed Board.</p>
<p>The bank, however, clarified that:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is not necessary to be a member bank in order to receive a master account&#8230;Custodia, however, took this additional step to demonstrate to FRBKC (Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City) and the board its willingness to submit to full federal supervision and accountability.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Why The Federal Judge Dismissed Request For Master Account</h2>
<p>In its updated argument, Custodia contended that all legally eligible depository institutions (including itself) should receive a master account and that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-lawyer-fed-operation-chokepoint-2/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">the Fed</a> didn&#8217;t have the right to reject applications from non-member depository institutions.</p>

<p>However, Judge Skavdahl ruled that Custodia Bank cannot receive a master account from FRBKC just because it is legally eligible to apply for one. According to the court filing, the Fed retains the discretion in granting or denying requests for master accounts.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the judge declared that the digital asset bank is not entitled to its requested writ of mandamus, compelling the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City to grant it a master account, thereby ruling in FRBKC’s favor.</p>

<title>Will Bitcoin Burst? Demand Outpaces Supply, Liquidity Crisis A Threat</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/will-bitcoin-burst-demand-outpaces-supply/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章提到比特币市场正面临着需求激增和供应减少的情况，可能引发流动性危机。加密数据分析公司CryptoQuant透露，比特币需求激增，同时流通供应下降，创造了潜在市场挤压的格局。分析师们警告，虽然可能导致价格上涨，但市场缺乏流动性也会带来极端波动。未来几周对比特币至关重要，投资者需密切关注价格波动和流动性水平。比特币可能在当前最高价附近进行横盘交易，但考虑到历史数据，短期的下跌可能为投资者提供积累比特币的机会。 <div>
<p>The Bitcoin market is brewing with anticipation as a confluence of surging demand and dwindling supply threatens to trigger a liquidity crisis. This potential shortage of available Bitcoin comes on the heels of the upcoming halving event, historically a bullish period for the world&#8217;s most popular cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>CryptoQuant, a prominent on-chain data analytics firm, recently revealed a staggering increase in Bitcoin demand. Over the past month, monthly demand skyrocketed from 40,000 BTC to a whopping 213,000 BTC. This meteoric rise is attributed to a perfect storm of factors, including the launch of new Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and aggressive accumulation by high net worth investors, often referred to as &#8220;whales.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">In 2024, monthly demand surged from 40K to 213K <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">$BTC</a>, driven by ETFs &amp; whale activity.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, available <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">#Bitcoin</a> dropped to 2.7M, signaling the tightest liquidity since March 2020.</p>
<p>Is this the beginning of a liquidity crisis? Let&#8217;s look into this <img alt="🧵" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f9f5.png" style="height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>— CryptoQuant.com (@cryptoquant_com) <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptoquant_com/status/1773357439989039265?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">March 28, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>On the other side of the equation, the total circulating supply of Bitcoin has plunged to just 2.7 million coins, the lowest level since the market crash of March 2020. This widening gap between surging demand and contracting supply paints a picture of a potential market squeeze. According to basic economic principles, such a scenario could send Bitcoin&#8217;s price significantly higher in the near future.</p>
<p>CC</p>
<p>However, analysts warn that a market starved of liquidity can be a double-edged sword. While it might fuel a price surge, it can also lead to wild price swings in either direction. In an illiquid market, large trades can have an outsized impact on the price, making Bitcoin vulnerable to extreme volatility. This underscores the importance for investors to closely monitor liquidity levels in the coming days.</p>

<p>With the halving event less than 20 days away, all eyes are on how this historical price catalyst will play out this time around. <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-analyst-sees-100k-before-halving/">The halving</a> refers to a pre-programmed event in Bitcoin&#8217;s code that cuts the block reward for miners in half, effectively slowing down the rate at which new Bitcoins are created. This event has historically coincided with bullish periods for Bitcoin, and many investors are eagerly waiting to see if this cycle will hold true.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">#Bitcoin</a></p>
<p>BTC is consolidating near the new ATH. In the previous cycle, we saw price going sideways for 150 days after the halving before it started pumping again.</p>
<p>It wouldn&#8217;t be unusual to see something similar happen near the halving.</p>
<p>Any dips before or after the halving… <a href="https://t.co/rsNMMB9Qwi" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/rsNMMB9Qwi</a></p>
<p>— Mags (@thescalpingpro) <a href="https://twitter.com/thescalpingpro/status/1773689566546805216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">March 29, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Popular crypto analysts are offering their insights into <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/why-bitcoin-halving-could-bring-uncertainty-to-mining-industry/">Bitcoin&#8217;s price trajectory</a> in the face of these converging factors. Analyst Mags predicts that Bitcoin might enter a period of sideways trading near its current all-time high of $70,000. Mags draws a parallel to the 2016 halving cycle, where the price consolidated for roughly 150 days before launching into a historic bull run. Mags views any short-term dips as opportunities for investors to accumulate Bitcoin before a potential parabolic surge.</p>
<p>RR</p>
<p>The coming weeks will be crucial for Bitcoin as it navigates the interplay of surging demand, limited supply, and the impending halving event. While the potential for a liquidity crisis exists, the historical bullish sentiment surrounding the halving suggests a possible breakout for Bitcoin. Investors are advised to tread cautiously and closely monitor market conditions, keeping an eye on both price movements and liquidity levels.</p>

<title>Binance Clamps Down: A New Strategy To Exclude US Traders Unveiled</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/binance-clamps-down-a-new-strategy-to-exclude-us/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/binance-clamps-down-a-new-strategy-to-exclude-us/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章介绍了Binance加强对客户的筛选以排除美国投资者，并对机构投资者进行更严格的检查。此举是为了符合监管要求。除了客户筛选外，Binance还实施更严格的措施以提高投资者保护并加强监督。尽管在美国加强合规框架，但在其他国家面临监管挑战。尼日利亚政府对Binance有指控，导致在该国的运营受到监管机构的审查。尼日利亚政府逮捕了两名Binance执行人员，并要求其关闭尼日利亚的业务。然而，BNB的交易价值仍保持在500美元以上。 <div>
<p>A recent report from Bloomberg has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-19/binance-tasks-prime-brokers-with-checks-to-root-out-us-investors" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">shed light</a> on Binance&#8217;s latest efforts to refine its client base. It enhanced the screening process for prime brokerage clients to exclude US-based investors from its platform.</p>
<p>This move comes amidst increasing regulatory demands and the exchange&#8217;s endeavors to fortify its compliance framework.</p>

<h2>Binance Intensifies Screening To Exclude US Investors</h2>
<p>According to the report, Binance&#8217;s initiative to engage prime brokers such as FalconX and Hidden Road in this enhanced screening process underscores the exchange&#8217;s commitment to adhering to regulatory standards.</p>
<p>The directive to these prime brokers, who predominantly serve institutional investors, includes rigorous checks on the geographical locations of their client&#8217;s offices, founders, and employees.</p>
<p>This approach to client screening is part of Binance&#8217;s broader strategy to ensure that US investors are not served in line with regulatory expectations.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as Binance navigates the complex regulatory environment, it has implemented stricter measures beyond client screening. Notably, the exchange has recently introduced more <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-implements-stricter-token-listing-procedure/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">stringent requirements for listing new digital tokens</a>.</p>
<p>As reported, this initiative aims to improve investor protection against fraudulent activities, such as &#8220;rug pulls,&#8221; and enhance oversight of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-investigates-300m-bome-token-pre-listing/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">token listings</a>.</p>
<p>These measures include extending the &#8220;cliff period&#8221; during which tokens cannot be sold, mandating increased allocation of coins to market makers, and instituting security deposits.</p>
<h2>Navigating Global Regulatory Challenges</h2>
<p>While Binance&#8217;s efforts to strengthen its compliance framework in the US are notable, the exchange also faces regulatory headwinds in other jurisdictions.</p>
<p>In Nigeria, for example, the government has raised serious concerns, accusing the exchange of facilitating transactions that they allege have negatively <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-suspends-all-operations-in-nigeria/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">impacted the national currency, the naira</a>. This has placed Binance under the spotlight, leading to heightened scrutiny from Nigerian regulators.</p>
<p>The situation escalated, and the Nigerian authorities took decisive action against Binance&#8217;s operations within their borders. Two executives from Binance, Tigran Gambaryan and Nadeem Anjarwalla, were<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/nigeria-detains-binances-crypto-crime-investigator/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> detained in a government facility</a> starting February 26, closely monitored by the Nigerian National Security Agency.</p>
<p>This move by the Nigerian government underscores the growing tension between Binance and regulatory bodies in its operating countries, spotlighting the broader challenges crypto exchanges face in maintaining compliance across diverse regulatory environments.</p>
<p>In addition to the detention of its executives, the Nigerian government has pressed the exchange to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/nigeria-crackdown-binance-authorities-demand/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">provide extensive transactional data on its top 100 users</a> within the country.</p>
<p>Despite regulatory turbulence, the exchange native token, BNB, has sustained its trading value above the $500 mark. Despite a 6.1% dip in its price over the last 24 hours, BNB currently maintains its position, trading at $516 at the time of writing.</p>

<title>CFTC’s Approach In KuCoin Case May Undermine SEC’s Authority, Commissioner Warns</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/cftcs-approach-may-undermine-secs-authority/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/cftcs-approach-may-undermine-secs-authority/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。文章讨论了CFTC对KuCoin提起诉讼的情况，包括指控未注册货币转发行为和未执行所需的客户了解身份实践。CFTC委员Pharm警告称，此举可能侵犯SEC对证券交易的管理权，并可能威胁现有投资者保护法律的有效性。文章指出CFTC和SEC之间在加强对加密领域监管权方面存在竞争，并呼吁尽快建立明确的加密货币监管框架。 <div>
<p>Following a recent lawsuit against prominent crypto exchange KuCoin, Caroline D. Pharm, a Commissioner at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has warned that the agency may be infringing on the Securities and Exchange Commission’s authority in regards to securities trading. This development comes as both financial regulators continue the tussle over the control of the crypto space amidst the lack of a clear regulatory framework for the US crypto industry.</p>

<h2>CFTC May Be Tampering With Investor Protection Law, Pharm Says</h2>
<p>On March 26, the CFTC, alongside the US Department of Justice, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/kucoin-faces-doj-prosecution/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">filed a lawsuit</a> against KuCoin and two of its founders for conspiracy to violate the Bank Secrecy Act and conduct an unregistered money transmitter operation. The petition, which was submitted in the Southern District of New York, also charges all parties for not conducting the required know-your-customer practices and breaching the US anti-money laundering laws.</p>
<p>Commenting on this development in a <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/SpeechesTestimony/phamstatement032924" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">public statement</a> released on March 29, the CFTC commissioner Caroline Pharm states the agency has taken an “aggressive” stance in performing its duties in regards to halting the operations of an unlicensed crypto derivatives trading firm. While Pharm commended the CFTC&#8217;s commitment and alertness in safeguarding the US financial markets, the commissioner says this recent lawsuit may undermine the SEC’s jurisdiction over securities trading.</p>
<p>This is because the CTFC complaints against KuCoin claim that according to Section2(c)2(D) of the Commodity Exchange Act, securities can be used in leverage trading, which regulation falls under the agency’s authority; Commissioner Pharm warns that the interpretation of this law does not provide enough differentiation of security and the trading activities of one. </p>
<p>Thus, Pharm states that the CFTC’s argument in this latest lawsuit could infringe on the SEC’s jurisdiction as well as threaten the validity of existing investor protection laws. The Commissioner said:</p>
<blockquote><p>The CFTC’s approach may infringe upon the SEC’s authority and undermine decades of robust investor protection laws by conflating a financial instrument with a financial activity, disrupting the foundations of securities markets. Owning shares is not the same thing as trading derivatives.”</p></blockquote>

<h2>The Crypto Turf War Continues</h2>
<p>Over the last few years, the CFTC and the SEC have battled for regulatory supremacy over the robust US crypto industry. While the CFTC continues to regulate the crypto futures and derivatives trading and the SEC focuses on processes involved in initial coin offerings (ICO), both regulators have attempted to gain greater control of the crypto space. </p>
<p>Back in March 2022, the CFTC chairman Rostin Behman in a testimony before the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, openly called for an expansion of the agency’s jurisdiction to other aspects of digital asset trading, </p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is a similar call to repetitive petitions by the SEC’s boss Gary Gensler who is also seeking greater authority from the US Congress to exert an increased influence on crypto regulations. Obviously, the existing battle between both regulators for higher regulations is unbeneficial to crypto investors and only signals the need for the hastening of the legislative process involved in the creation of clear crypto regulations. </p>

<title>Shiba Inu Whales Make Big Moves – Is It Time To Buy?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的<br />Shiba Inu的鲸鱼再次进行了大额交易，转移了2万亿SHIB代币到另一个钱包。这表明大型投资者对SHIB仍然持有看涨情绪，且有意增加其持有量。交易数据显示，某些钱包可能为了满足客户需求而进行这些转移。部分钱包将这些代币转移至未知钱包，可能是为了长期持有。同时，一些分析师建议目前是购买Shiba Inu的好时机，预计SHIB可能在7月达到新的历史高点。 <div>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-pepe-whales-sold/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Shiba Inu (SHIB) whales</a> are at it again, with <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-transactions-spree/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">large transactions</a> involving the meme coin recorded lately. These high-volume transactions have piqued the interest of other investors, who have deliberated on whether this could be the perfect opportunity to accumulate the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-dogecoin-shib-excitement/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">meme coin</a>. </p>
<h2><b>Shiba Inu Whale Transfers 2 Trillion SHIB Tokens </b></h2>
<p>On-chain analytics platform Whale Alert revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/whale_alert/status/1772830256468042099?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> that 2 trillion SHIB were transferred from a Kucoin-linked wallet (Kucoin 6) to another Kucoin-linked wallet (Kucoin 20). Interestingly, this came <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/kucoin-faces-doj-prosecution/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">amidst the charges leveled</a> against the exchange and its founders. </p>

<p>On-chain data further revealed that the receiving wallet began to transfer these <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-burn-rate-17000/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">SHIB tokens</a> across different wallets. While the nature of the transactions remains unknown, the troubled crypto exchange may have made these transfers to meet customers&#8217; demands. </p>
<p>If so, that signifies a bullish sentiment among SHIB whales, who still want to purchase as much of the meme coin as possible. For instance, the Kucoin 20 wallet, which received the 2 trillion SHIB tokens, <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x8bcd935f10d855019fd3207a422ec2a87cf9fcc19ce812664c39a916c1033319" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">transferred</a> over 35 million SHIB to an unknown wallet, and that wallet hasn’t moved the SHIB tokens since then, which suggests they could be long-term holders. </p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/hcTQ3Clo/" width="1835" /></p>

<p>Another wallet that also <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xa63c6d609c837eaecb72263f2504ed0975f9348e689237ab69c1ccf3ac376d5c" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">received</a> 4.7 million SHIB tokens from the Kucoin 20 wallet moved its holdings to a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-exchanges-2-year-low/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">warm wallet</a>, possibly due to Kucoin FUD, and in a bid to preserve its holdings. The moves made by these wallets underline the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-latest-developments-2/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">bullish outlook</a> for the SHIB token, with large-scale investors having no intention of disposing of their tokens anytime soon. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, it is worth mentioning that the Kucoin 20 wallet transferred 1.4 trillion <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shib-magazine/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">SHIB tokens</a> back to the Kucoin 6 wallet. Those tokens are still in the wallet and haven’t been moved since then. </p>
<h2><b>Time To Buy Shiba Inu?</b></h2>
<p>Crypto trader and analyst Xanrox had <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-surge-crypto-shib/#:~:text=Shiba%20Inu%20To%20See%20A%20300%25%20Gain%20Before%20Year%2Dend&amp;text=Looking%20at%20SHIB&#039;s%20chart%2C%20the,invest%20in%20the%20crypto%20token." rel="noopener " target="_blank">previously advised</a> investors to load their SHIB bags at the $0.0000212995 price level. However, with SHIB trading far above that level, there is the feeling that it may never return to that entry point, especially with crypto expert Rekt Capital <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-price-mirrors-2021/#:~:text=Crypto%20expert%20Rekt%20Capital%20has,ATH)%20and%20even%20surpass%20it." rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">recently stating</a> that the meme coin has built support at the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-price-0-0001-target/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">$0.000026041 price level</a>.</p>

<p>Although Xanrox’s entry point may have been missed, investing in SHIB right now still looks like a good move based on the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/122000-surge-shiba-inu-price/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">predictions</a> of different analysts. This includes Xanrox, who hinted that SHIB could rise to a new all-time high (ATH) by July. Meanwhile, analysts like Oscar Ramos have <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-price-100-0-0001/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">predicted</a> that SHIB could shed another zero on the road to $0.0001. </p>
<p>At the time of writing, SHIB was trading at around $0.00003029, down over 2% in the last 24 hours, according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/shiba-inu/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">data</a> from CoinMarketCap.</p>

<title>UK Judge Freezes $7.6M Of Craig Wright Assets In Bitcoin Authorship Trial</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的<br />世界将目光聚集在克雷格·赖特和加密开放专利联盟（COPA）之间的审判上，确定澳大利亚计算机科学家是否是比特币的创造者，中本聪。审判结束后，一名英国法官授予了对赖特760万美元资产的全球冻结令，因为案件支付成本的风险很高。法官裁定克雷格·赖特不是比特币的创造者，COPA成功证明了这一点，并获得了对其资产的冻结令。考虑到赖特的历史和可能的资产转移，法官认为存在逃避支付成本的风险。 <div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The world had all eyes on the trial between Craig Wright and the Crypto Open Patent Alliance (COPA) that determined whether the Australian computer scientist was Bitcoin’s creator, Satoshi Nakamoto.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Now that the trial has concluded, a UK Judge granted a Worldwide Freezing Order (WFO) of $7.6 million in Wright’s assets. The decision was issued due to the high avoidance risk of the case’s payment costs.</p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin&#8217;s Creator Could Be Anyone, It’s Just Not Wright</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Craig Wright’s claims started in 2016 when he began to assert that he was behind the pseudonym identity of Satoshi Nakamoto. For years, these claims remained unproven and highly contested by the crypto community.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Wright faced several legal battles over his attempts to prove authorship of Bitcoin and to copyright BTC’s whitepaper.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Earlier this month, Judge James Mellor <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/judge-rejects-craig-wrights-claim-to-be-satoshi/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">concluded</a> that Wright was not Bitcoin’s creator. The trial between the Australian computer scientist and COPA determined that “overwhelming evidence” was presented to debunk Wright’s claims.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The judge’s resolution concludes that “COPA had established that Dr Wright was not Satoshi Nakamoto and had not been the creator of Bitcoin.” However, the final judgment that officially states these claims as false has not yet been finished and published.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Despite this, Judge Mellor <a href="https://bitcoindefense.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/COPA-v-Wright-WFO-Approved-Judgment-28.03.2024.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">granted</a> a £6 million ($7.6 million) WFO on Wright’s assets per COPA’s request.  According to the document, the cost of the trial totals just above £6.7 million ($8.45 million).</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The application’s judgment states that, as usual, the intention was to hold a hearing “at which the remaining relief sought, including costs, would be determined” after the trial’s judgment was finalized.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">However, Judge Mellor considered that issuing the WFO application’s judgment first was necessary to prevent Wright from evading court costs.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Concerns Over Payment Of The Trial’s Cost</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Due to the short notice between the WFO application and the hearing, Wright’s legal team “was not able to make anything other than very short observations” on the application.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">However, COPA “correctly anticipated this, correctly addressed me as if this WFO application was made without notice and so rightly acknowledged their duty to make full and frank disclosure.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">During the hearing, COPA submitted enough evidence to raise concerns over Wright’s intentions to pay the relief now that the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/craig-wright-bitcoin-creator-uk/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">trial concluded</a>. Some of the Australian computer scientist moves on March 18 raised the alarms.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Monday after the trial&#8217;s conclusion, Wright filed a form notifying Companies House that his shares in his company RCJBR Holding had been transferred to DeMorgan PTE, a company organized under the laws of Singapore.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This decision led COPA to believe Wright could be taking measures to offshore his assets and “seek to evade the costs and consequences of his loss at trial.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, Judge Mellor considered Wright’s “history of default in relation to orders for the payment of money” and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/craig-wright-confesses-to-faking-satoshi-evidence/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">his lying track record</a>. According to the judgment, “COPA has a very powerful claim to be awarded a very substantial sum in costs (&#8230;) I consider there is a very real risk of dissipation.”</p>

<title>Bitcoin Sharks Show Biggest Monthly Buying Spree Since 2012</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-sharks-biggest-monthly-buying-spree-2012/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-sharks-biggest-monthly-buying-spree-2012/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。最近一个月以来，比特币的鲨鱼群体已经进行了迄今为止规模最大的资产积累。拥有100至1,000 BTC的实体已经购买了超过268,000 BTC，价值约18.6亿美元。这表明这些大型投资者一直在增加他们的持仓。此外，最近从交易所Coinbase中观察到的资产流出也是一个积极的迹象，暗示投资者更倾向于自我托管，可能长期持有他们的比特币。最近比特币价格达到新的历史高点，目前约为69,400美元。 <div>
<p>On-chain data shows the Bitcoin shark cohort has participated in its largest accumulation spree over the past month since 2012.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Sharks Have Purchased More Than 268,000 BTC In The Last Month</h2>
<p>As analyst James Van Straten explains in a new <a href="https://twitter.com/jvs_btc/status/1773624811098378326" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Bitcoin entities holding between 100 and 1,000 BTC have made some large net buying moves in the past month.</p>

<p>An &#8220;entity&#8221; here refers to a collection of addresses owned by the same investor as determined through analysis by the on-chain analytics firm Glassnode.</p>
<p>The entities holding between 100 to 1,000 BTC are popularly known as &#8220;<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-rockets-up-8-shark-whale-holdings-hit-3-high/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">sharks</a>.&#8221; At the current exchange rate of the asset, this range converts to about $6.93 million to $69.3 million.</p>
<p>Thus, the investors carrying these amounts are clearly quite big, meaning that they should have some significance for the market as a whole. However, these sharks are still smaller and less influential than the whales, who typically occupy the range above 1,000 BTC.</p>
<p>Given the relevance of the sharks, their behavior is naturally worth monitoring. One way to track this behavior is through the &#8220;<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/not-your-keys-bitcoin-exchange-outflows-new-ath/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">net position change</a>&#8221; of the cohort.</p>
<p>This on-chain metric keeps track of the net amount of supply that entered into or exited out of the wallets of the entities belonging to the shark group over the past month.</p>
<p>The chart below shows this indicator&#8217;s trend over the entire history of the cryptocurrency.</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Sharks" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="1013" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GJ0t1pCWsAAboso?format=jpg&amp;name=large" width="1800" /></p>

<p>As the above graph shows, the Bitcoin shark net position change has been at highly positive levels recently. This would imply that these large investors have been adding a net number of coins to their wallets.</p>
<p>The sharks have made net purchases amounting to around 268,441 BTC in the last 30 days, which is currently worth almost $18.6 billion. This is a staggering amount and is the largest accumulation these holders have done since way back in 2012.</p>
<p>Back then, BTC&#8217;s price was a small fraction of what it is today so that the current shark accumulation would be the most impressive in the asset&#8217;s history based on the sheer amount of capital involved.</p>
<p>With such a high degree of accumulation, it&#8217;s no wonder that the past month has been a positive one for Bitcoin, where its price has reached new all-time highs.</p>

<p>Another positive development in the market recently is perhaps the outflows that the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has observed, as Straten has pointed out in another X post.</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Coinbase Outflows" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="1013" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GJ1JzDPXYAApPfK?format=jpg&amp;name=large" width="1800" /></p>

<p>According to the analyst, $1.1 billion worth of the asset was taken off the platform&#8217;s wallets yesterday, the third biggest net outflow this year, with all of the top three occurring within the past month.</p>
<p>Exchange outflows can be a bullish sign for the cryptocurrency, as they suggest that investors prefer to go into self-custody, possibly to HODL onto their coins for extended periods.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>Bitcoin&#8217;s price has gone a bit stale over the past few days as it has been unable to pick any direction. At present, BTC is trading at around $69,400.</p>

<title>Grayscale Unveils New Staking-Focused Income Fund Exclusively For High Net-Worth Individuals</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/grayscale-unveils-new-staking-focused-income-fund/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/grayscale-unveils-new-staking-focused-income-fund/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。资产管理公司和比特币现货交易所交易基金发行商Grayscale推出了其最新产品“动态收入基金”（GDIF），旨在通过投资于权益证明数字资产来优化回报。该基金将包括Osmosis（OSMO）、Solana（SOL）、Polkadot（DOT）等令人期待的代币，并专注于获取权益证明数字资产的收益。此外，比特币ETF市场显示出强劲的反弹，积极发展和增加投资者的兴趣。Grayscale和其他主要竞争对手本周表现出了强劲的表现，资金净流入超过细出的水平。比特币ETF市场在交易启动不到三个月的时间内，累计流入超过125亿美元。当前市场的主要加密货币是以69500美元的价格交易，并短暂跌破了关键的70000美元阈值。 <div>
<p>Asset management firm and spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuer Grayscale has unveiled its latest offering, the &#8220;Dynamic Income Fund&#8221; (GDIF), designed to focus on investments in <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sec-delays-decision-on-grayscales-ethereum-etf-here/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">proof-of-stake tokens</a>.</p>
<h2>Grayscale Launches Dynamic Income Fund</h2>
<p>This actively managed investment product seeks to optimize returns through staking rewards associated with proof-of-stake digital assets, according to the asset manager&#8217;s <a href="https://www.grayscale.com/private-funds/gdif" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement </a>on Friday. </p>
<p>Friday&#8217;s announcement also illuminates the fund&#8217;s key steps, which include raising capital from investors, allocating capital to a portfolio of proof-of-stake tokens using qualitative and quantitative factors, staking tokens to earn rewards, converting token rewards to cash on a weekly basis, and distributing cash to investors every quarter while rebalancing tokens as needed to maximize income.</p>

<p>Grayscale has hinted that the GDIF will initially include tokens such as Osmosis (OSMO), Solana (SOL), Polkadot (DOT), and other tokens to be announced.</p>
<p>However, the asset manager clarifies that the holdings are subject to change at the manager&#8217;s discretion, and the percentages allocated to each token may not sum up to 100% due to rounding.</p>
<p>To provide a deeper understanding of Grayscale&#8217;s new venture, staking involves investors actively validating blockchain network transactions and earning staking rewards in transaction fees for their services. To stake, investors commit a certain amount of their tokens to the network, enabling them to contribute to its security and governance.</p>
<p>Grayscale aims to simplify the complexities associated with staking and unstacking multiple tokens, as each token has its unique requirements and timelines for staking and unstacking. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that GDIF is exclusively available to qualified clients, defined as individuals with assets under management of $1,100,000 or a net worth of $2,200,000. </p>
<h2>Bitcoin ETF Market Shows Strong Rebound</h2>
<p>According to recent <a href="https://x.com/BitMEXResearch/status/1773674532500312534?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">data </a>from BitMEX research, the Bitcoin ETF market has witnessed significant developments in the past few days. Notably, the outflows of $887 million reported last week have nearly reversed, indicating a renewed investor interest. </p>
<p>Grayscale, one of the prominent players in the space with its <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/back-to-back-negative-bitcoin-etf-flows/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">GBTC ETF</a>, saw minimal outflows of just $104.9 million on Thursday, the lowest since March 12, as shown in the chart below.</p>
<img alt="Grasycale" class="size-large wp-image-290525" height="660" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GJ1bS_rXUAAL4du.jpeg?w=521&#038;resize=521%2C660" width="521" />
<p>In contrast, Grayscale&#8217;s competitors have demonstrated strong performance, recording net inflows of $844 million in only four days. On March 28, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-gobbles-up-nearly-196000-btc/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Blackrock&#8217;s ETF IBIT</a> emerged as the frontrunner, witnessing substantial gains with $95.1 million in inflows. Fidelity&#8217;s FBTC followed with $68 million in inflows on the same day. </p>

<p>However, it is worth noting that these figures are significantly lower than the best-recorded days for both asset managers. Blackrock&#8217;s ETF IBIT reached its peak on March 12, surpassing $849 million in total inflows. Similarly, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/fidelity-adjusts-ethereum-etf-application/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Fidelity&#8217;s FBTC </a>experienced its highest inflow on March 7, reaching $473 million.</p>
<p>BitMEX research data further reveals that the cumulative flow of the Bitcoin ETF market has approached $12.5 billion within just three months since trading commenced on January 11. </p>
<img alt="Grayscale " height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/PjHLRHk6/" width="1815" />
<p>At present, the leading cryptocurrency in the market is trading at $69,500, experiencing a brief dip below the crucial $70,000 threshold</p>

<title>Detained Binance Executive Tigran Gambaryan Seeks Justice, Sues Nigerian Government</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/binance-executive-sues-nigerian-government/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/binance-executive-sues-nigerian-government/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。在尼日利亚的加密货币活动中，Binance的执行人员Tigran Gambaryan对尼日利亚国家安全顾问和经济及金融犯罪委员会提起了诉讼，声称其基本人权被侵犯。Gambaryan还表示他受到非法拘留和国际护照被没收，请求法院下令释放他并返还护照。此外，他要求被告公开向他道歉，并禁止进一步扣留他。同时，尼日利亚政府对Binance提出了偷税漏税指控，涉及Anjarwalla和Gambaryan等人。这些诉讼和偷税漏税指控突显了加密货币交易所在尼日利亚所面临的挑战。 <div>
<p>Amid Nigeria&#8217;s <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/nigeria-sec-to-hike-vasp-registration-fees-under/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">crackdown </a>on cryptocurrency activities, one of the detained Binance executives, Tigran Gambaryan, has taken legal action against Nigeria&#8217;s National Security Adviser (NSA) and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), alleging a violation of his basic human rights. </p>
<p>Gambaryan, who serves as Binance&#8217;s Head of Financial Crime Compliance, was <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/nigeria-detains-binances-crypto-crime-investigator/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">arrested in February</a> along with fellow Binance member Nadeem Anjarwalla. </p>
<h2>Executive Alleges Rights Violation In Nigerian Detention</h2>
<p>According to local media <a href="https://punchng.com/detained-binance-executive-drags-efcc-nsa-to-court/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reports</a>, Gambaryan has filed a lawsuit seeking a declaration that his detention and the confiscation of his international passport violate the provisions of the country&#8217;s constitution. </p>
<p>In his legal motion, Gambaryan requested the court to order the NSA and EFCC to release him from custody and return his passport immediately. </p>

<p>Binance&#8217;s Head of Financial Crimes Compliance also sought a permanent injunction to prevent the defendants and their agents from further detaining him with any <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/nigeria-crackdown-binance-authorities-demand/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">investigation </a>of the exchange&#8217;s operations in the country. </p>
<p>Additionally, Gambaryan urged the court to compel the respondents to apologize to him publicly. He argued that his presence in Nigeria was to honor the invitation of the Office of the National Security Adviser and EFCC to discuss matters concerning Binance in the country. </p>
<p>The executive asserted that he had not committed any offense during the meeting and had not been officially informed of any personal offense committed in Nigeria.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the other detained Binance executive, Nadeem Anjarwalla, managed to escape from government custody approximately one month after his initial detention, as Bitcoinist <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-houdini-binance-exec-escapes-from-nigerian-custody-amid-tax-evasion-charges-report/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">reported</a> earlier this week. </p>
<p>According to the information gathered, Anjarwalla stayed with Gambaryan in a guesthouse in Abuja. During Ramadan, the guards took Anjarwalla to a nearby mosque for prayers, from which he allegedly escaped and left Abuja on a Middle Eastern airline. Anjarwalla has also filed a similar complaint with the Nigerian government.</p>
<h2>Binance Faces Tax Evasion Charges</h2>
<p>In a related development, the Nigerian government has filed tax evasion charges against Binance, with Anjarwalla and Gambaryan as the second and third defendants. </p>
<p>The charges, submitted at the Federal High Court in Abuja by the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS), accuse Binance of non-payment of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-suspends-all-operations-in-nigeria/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Value-Added Tax</a>, Company Income Tax, failure to file tax returns, and complicity in aiding customers to evade taxes through its platform. </p>
<p>The government further alleges that Binance failed to register with the FIRS for tax purposes and violated existing tax regulations within the country.</p>

<p>The lawsuits and tax evasion charges against Binance and its executives highlight the increasing <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-ceo-7-days-to-address-terrorism-financing/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">regulatory scrutiny </a>cryptocurrency exchanges face in Nigeria. It remains to be seen how this story will unfold and the outcome. </p>
<img alt="Binance " class="size-large" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/e8edABq7/" width="1815" />
<p>At present, the exchange&#8217;s native token, Binance Coin (BNB), is trading at $617. Over the past month, BNB has shown a consistent upward trend, experiencing a remarkable increase of over 47%. This surge has brought the token closer to its previous all-time high of $686, which was achieved in May 2021.</p>

<title>Crypto Open Interest At All-Time High: Explosive Move Incoming?</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-open-interest-all-time-high-explosive-move/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-open-interest-all-time-high-explosive-move/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。加密领域的总开放利益最近达到了历史最高点，表明加密货币可能面临波动性增加。开放利益是指与数字资产相关的所有衍生品头寸的总量，目前达到了高达513亿美元的水平。随着这一指标的上升，投资者正积极地在市场上开立新头寸，可能增加了杠杆，导致资产更可能出现剧烈波动。当前极端的开放利益水平可能意味着市场可能在不久的将来出现尖锐价格波动。 <div>
<p>Data shows the total open interest in the crypto sector has recently been at an all-time high, indicating that volatility may be coming for the coins.</p>
<h2>Crypto Open Interest Has Been At Extreme Levels Recently</h2>
<p>As CryptoQuant Netherlands community manager Maartunn pointed out in a <a href="https://twitter.com/JA_Maartun/status/1773439458936778874" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, the total crypto open interest has recently been sitting around a whopping $51.3 billion.</p>
<p>The &#8220;<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-open-interest-alarming-levels-brace-impact/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">open interest</a>&#8221; here refers to the total amount of derivative positions related to all digital assets currently open on the various exchanges in the sector.</p>

<p>When the value of this metric rises, it means that the investors are opening up fresh positions on the market right now. Generally, the total leverage in the sector goes up when such a trend takes form, so the assets could become more likely to show some <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-exchange-outflows-inflows-highs-volatility/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">volatility</a>.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a downtrend in the indicator implies that the investors are closing their positions of their own volition or getting forcibly liquidated by their platform.</p>
<p>A sharp plunge in the metric could accompany some violent price action, but once the indicator&#8217;s value has settled down, the markets could become more stable due to a washout of leverage.</p>
<p>Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the crypto open interest over the past few years:</p>
<p><img alt="Crypto Open Interest" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="668" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GJyFniHXUAAXixn?format=png&amp;name=large" width="1404" /></p>

<p>As displayed in the above graph, the total open interest in the crypto sector has been riding an uptrend recently. This rise in the metric has come as the prices of Bitcoin and other assets have gone through their rallies.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t unusual, as the market attracts much attention during such price action. With a large amount of attention naturally comes speculation, so users flood exchanges with positions in these periods.</p>
<p>From the chart, it&#8217;s visible that open interest in the crypto market also rose during the<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-shatters-profit-taking-streak-2021-bull-run/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> 2021 bull run</a>. The latest values of the indicator, however, have already surpassed the peak witnessed back then.</p>
<p>The metric has recently been around $51.3 billion, an all-time high. As mentioned before, high metric values can lead to volatility for the various assets in the sector.</p>

<p>As such, the current extreme levels of open interest could mean that the market may be prone to seeing some sharp price action in the near future. This volatility could take the market in either direction, at least on paper.</p>
<p>As is apparent from the graph, though, the indicator has historically only seen a significant cooldown with crashes in the Bitcoin price, so the current overheated open interest may be a bad sign for the crypto market.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Price</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around the $70,100 mark, up more than 9% over the past week.</p>

<title>Here’s Where Dogecoin And Shiba Inu Would Be With The Market Cap Of Ethereum</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-shiba-inu-ethereum/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-shiba-inu-ethereum/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章讨论了比特币、以太坊和狗狗币市值之间的比较。如果狗狗币达到以太坊的市值，其价格将大幅上涨。同样，如果狗狗币市值达到其历史最高值，价格将更高。狗狗币目前市值为307亿美元，价格为0.214美元。另一方面，如果以太坊的市值等于狗狗币，以太坊的价格将大幅下跌。类似地，狗狗币与狗狗币市值的比较表明其价格将大幅上涨。Shiba Inu 与以太坊市值的比较也显示价格差距巨大，但其价格随着市值的增长也将大幅上涨。 <div>
<p class="p2">Dogecoin and Shiba Inu are trending higher than they were a year ago, but they are still a long way from their 2021 all-time high prices. While they both feature prominently in the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market cap, they are still far below the market cap of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-spot-etfs-odds-at-a-pessimistic-25/">Ethereum</a>, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap. So, if both <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-on-chain-metrics-explode/">DOGE</a> and SHIB attained the market cap of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-lead-dev-ethereum/">Ethereum</a>, what price would they be trading at?</p>
<h2 class="p2">Dogecoin With The Market Cap Of Ethereum</h2>
<p class="p2">The Dogecoin market cap is currently sitting $30.7 billon while the price is at $0.214. This makes it the largest meme coin in the space in terms of market cap and puts it ahead of the likes of Shiba Inu. However, if the DOGE market cap were to reach the market cap of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-lead-dev-ethereum/">Ethereum</a>, the price would trade much higher than it is now.</p>

<p class="p2">The MarketCapOf website <a href="https://marketcapof.com/ethereum/dogecoin/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">shows</a> where one cryptocurrency would be trading with the market cap of another, and in this case, it’s Dogecoin compared to Ethereum. If the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-developer-utility-doge/">DOGE</a> market cap were to reach $424 billion, which is the current market cap of ETH, its price would trade at $2.96. Such a price point would mean that the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-on-chain-metrics-explode/">DOGE price</a> would be trading at 1,300% higher than its current price level.</p>
<p><img alt="Dogecoin Ethereum" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-290450 aligncenter" height="354" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-29-at-13.46.39.png?w=640&#038;resize=640%2C354" width="640" /></p>

<p class="p2">Then to take it one step further, the website shows where the Dogecoin price would be if its market cap were to reach the all-time high market cap of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-founder-buterin-whatmemecoins-could-be/">Ethereum</a>. This would put it at $3.97 per coin with a market cap of $571.66 billion. It would also be 1,800% higher than its current price.</p>
<p class="p2">On the flip side, ETH, with the market cap of DOGE, would mean that the former would be trading at $255.89 per coin. It would be 93% lower than its current price, with a market cap of $30.7 billion.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Shiba Inu With The Market Cap Of Ethereum</h2>
<p class="p2">Comparing the Shiba Inu price with the market cap of Ethereum leaves a large disparity between its current value and where it will be. As the website shows, SHIB’s price, if it reaches $424 billion, would sit at $0.00071637. Consequently, this would mean a more than 2,300% increase from its current level.</p>

<p class="p2">Then, looking at <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-lead-dev-ethereum/">SHIB</a> with the all-time high market cap of ETH puts it at 3,100% higher at $0.0009691. Inversely, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-spot-etfs-odds-at-a-pessimistic-25/">Ethereum</a> trading at the market cap of Shiba Inu puts it at a mere $150, which is 96% lower than its current price of $3,500.</p>
<p class="p2">This comparison shows the disparity between the assets despite all being some of the largest cryptocurrencies in the space. It also gives investors an idea of what to expect if the price of these coins were to continue growing over time.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Futures Approved For Trading On Brazil’s B3 Exchange, Launching April 17</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-futures-approved-for-trading-on-brazil/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-futures-approved-for-trading-on-brazil/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />巴西证券交易所B3获得巴西证券监管机构批准，将推出比特币期货交易，预计4月17日开始。合约将与纳斯达克比特币参考价格相关联，每份合约代表巴西雷亚尔10%的比特币价格。B3表示，比特币期货合约将以财务结算方式进行，避免实际比特币交易。此外，黑石集团推出iShares比特币信托ETF（IBIT39）也进驻巴西市场。这进一步证实了巴西在全球比特币和加密货币市场中的重要地位。在比特币价格方面，BTC的交易价格为70,400美元，在过去的一周和一个月内分别增长了11%和16%。今年迄今为止，BTC的增长接近150%。 <div>
<p>In response to the global demand for Bitcoin-related products, Brazil has seized the opportunity to capitalize on the momentum surrounding the leading cryptocurrency. </p>
<p>According to a Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/brazil-exchange-operator-b3-offer-bitcoin-futures-april-2024-03-28/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, Brazilian exchange operator B3 announced on Thursday that it has received approval from Brazil&#8217;s securities regulator to offer Bitcoin futures trading, which is expected to begin on April 17.</p>
<h2>BTC Futures Linked To Nasdaq Reference Price</h2>
<p>B3 announced that the official launch date of futures trading for BTC may be subject to change. Nevertheless, the exchange confirmed that future<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/hedge-fund-goes-long-bitcoin-short-microstrategy/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> contracts</a> will be linked to the Nasdaq Bitcoin reference price, with each contract representing 10% of the BTC price in Brazilian reais.</p>

<p>Felipe Goncalves, B3&#8217;s superintendent of swap rates and currency products, emphasized the significance of this milestone, stating: </p>
<blockquote><p>The launch meets the demand for a derivative that allows a hedge against Bitcoin&#8217;s price fluctuations or a directional exposure to the asset. </p></blockquote>
<p>It is important to note that the Bitcoin futures contract offered by B3 will be settled financially, meaning that no actual <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-at-crossroads-time-to-hold-or-take-profit/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">buying or selling</a> of BTC will occur. </p>
<p>This approach aligns with the landscape of regulated derivatives markets, allowing investors to engage with Bitcoin&#8217;s price movements without requiring direct ownership of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-difficulty-drops-miners-expand-halving/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">cryptocurrency</a>.</p>
<h2>Brazil Welcomes BlackRock&#8217;s iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF</h2>
<p>This development coincides with one of the world&#8217;s largest asset managers, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/north-koreas-eth-transfer-to-blackrock-via-tornado/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">BlackRock</a>, and a prominent Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF) issuer <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/blackrock-spot-bitcoin-etf-launches-in-brazil-etf-market-secures-4-of-total-btc-supply/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcing </a>the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF (IBIT39) launch in Brazil in early March. </p>
<p>Felipe Gonçalves highlighted the growth of the crypto market in Brazil, citing the existence of 13 ETFs with a total asset value of R$2.5 billion (approximately $505 million). Notably, the market has attracted institutional investors, including funds and individual investors, with a current count of 170,000. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-beats-okx-and-kraken-holdings/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF</a> (IBIT39) is expected to have a management fee of 0.25%, with a one-year waiver that reduces the fee to 0.12% once the fund surpasses $5 billion in assets under management. </p>

<p>With B3&#8217;s regulatory approval for Bitcoin futures trading and the iShares Bitcoin Trust ETF launch, Brazil is solidifying its position as a significant player in the expanding global Bitcoin and cryptocurrency market. </p>
<p>These developments provide investors with new avenues to participate in the digital asset ecosystem while fostering the growth and maturation of Brazil&#8217;s <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-gobbles-up-nearly-196000-btc/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">crypto investment landscape</a>.</p>
<img alt="Bitcoin" class="size-large" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/5HR2zDx0/" width="1815" />
<p>The largest cryptocurrency in the market trades at $70,400, demonstrating a rebound from the $60,800 level following a significant correction. BTC has successfully consolidated above this crucial level over the past 24 hours, indicating a strong momentum to surpass its previous all-time high of $73,700, achieved on March 14.</p>
<p>Examining the cryptocurrency&#8217;s performance over longer time frames, we see that BTC has exhibited substantial gains. In the past week alone, an impressive increase of 11% was recorded. BTC has experienced a notable surge of 16% in the past month. </p>
<p>Furthermore, its year-to-date growth is nearly 150%, highlighting the sustained bullish trend that has prevailed since the end of the bear market and the subsequent recovery from the 2022 crypto winter.</p>

<title>Dogecoin Influencer Predicts When DOGE Payments Will Debut On X</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-doge-payments-x/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-doge-payments-x/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的<br /> Dogecoin的开发者预测DOGE币将在未来五年内被整合到X Payments中。开发者预测这一整合将在未来比五年时间更早地实现，但不会在明年就发生。在此之前，X Payments将先引入法定货币，而不是加密货币。在整合加密货币之前，必须完成一系列关键的发展阶段，包括遵守监管要求。特斯拉CEO马斯克透露，X Payments已在美国三个地区展开测试，并有望获得加州另一项货币转移许可。 <div>
<p>Dogecoin influencer, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-influencer-crypto/">Mishaboar</a> has predicted the timeline for Dogecoin’s native token, DOGE to be integrated into <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-x-peer-to-peer-payments/">Elon Musk’s X Payments</a>. The developer has highlighted key phases and plans that must be accomplished before <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/company/accepting-crypto-as-payment-are-businesses-catching-on/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">cryptocurrency payments</a> are potentially added on X.  </p>
<h2>Developer Forecasts Dogecoin in X Payments Within 5 Years</h2>
<p>In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post released on Thursday, March 28, Mishaboar <a href="https://x.com/mishaboar/status/1773158061529526489?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">forecasted</a> the introduction of Dogecoin into X Payments in the coming years. The developer anticipates that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-payments-x-doge/">Dogecoin payments could be potentially introduced into X</a> within five years.</p>

<p>During discussions about forthcoming developments set for X Payments, Mishaboar addressed a member of the crypto community who <a href="https://x.com/gary61764440/status/1773128197267145170?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">suggested</a> that the implementation of crypto payments into X may take up to five years. Countering the statement, Mishaboar expressed anticipation for the integration of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-payments-not-a-preferred-choice-survey/">crypto payments</a> on X  “much earlier than that.” </p>
<p>The Dogecoin developer has anchored his predictions on the growing adoption and approval of cryptocurrencies in global payment systems. According to Mishaboar, world-leading payment services like <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/paypal-granted-for-crypto-services-in-the-uk/">PayPal are already supporting cryptocurrencies</a>, suggesting a strong possibility for X payments to follow suit and integrate cryptocurrencies in the near future. </p>
<p>In projecting <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shib-inclusion-x/">DOGE payments on X</a> before five years, Mishaboar has also tempered expectations by predicting that the integration is unlikely to occur as early as next year. While these forecasts have further piqued the heightened anticipation within the crypto community, it’s important to note that they <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/x-payments-dogecoin-integration/">remain speculative</a>. No official statements have been issued by <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-gains-momentum-as-musk-hints-at-future-tesla-payments-is-doge-going-to-the-moon/">Musk</a> confirming the integration of Dogecoin or any other cryptocurrency into X Payments. </p>
<h2>Key Developmental Phases Set For X Payments</h2>
<p>In his post, Mishaboar <a href="https://x.com/mishaboar/status/1773069549115474061?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">revealed</a> that there were still several developments planned for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/x-plans-to-launch-payments-service-in-2024/">X Payments</a> before the project launches officially. The developer underscored a statement made by Musk last year, in which the SpaceX CEO indicated that the first phase of X Payments would focus on introducing fiat currencies, rather than cryptocurrencies. </p>

<p>The crypto developer has <a href="https://x.com/mishaboar/status/1773078098159833405?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">stated</a> that potentially introducing cryptocurrency into X Payments would be a step-by-step process, emphasizing the importance of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/x-dogecoin-payments-included/">obtaining key licenses</a> and meeting regulatory requirements before launching a payments service on X.  </p>
<p>Recently, Musk disclosed that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-surges-x-payments-secures-3-new-licenses/">X Payments had secured money transmitter licenses</a> across three regions in the United States. The Tesla CEO has noted that X is getting closer to winning another money transmitter license in California. Achieving this milestone would mark another significant step towards advancing the potential launch of X Payments.</p>

<title>$1.4 Billion USDC Moved To Coinbase: Will History Repeat And Bitcoin Rally?</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/usdc-coinbasehistory-repeat-bitcoin-rally/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/usdc-coinbasehistory-repeat-bitcoin-rally/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />美元稳定币USDC的14亿美元巨额转移至Coinbase可能预示着牛市资金注入的准备。Bitcoin和Ethereum价格受到卖方控制，但USDC流入交易所通常被视为积极发展，对加密货币市场和主要资产有利。过去的USDC流入与价格上涨相吻合，投资者对于比特币和以太坊的复苏充满信心。USDC市值已逐渐增长，有可能超越XRP成为全球第六大最有价值的加密货币。 <div>
<p>On March 29, a massive $1.4 billion transfer of USDC, a fiat-backed stablecoin issued by Circle, was moved to Coinbase, one of the leading crypto exchanges. </p>
<p>Sharing a screen grab that <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/JA_Maartun/status/1773661583488536810" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">cites</a> CryptoQuant&#8217;s data, the analyst said the hefty inflow could suggest that bulls might be ready to inject capital. If that happens, top cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum could benefit.
</p>
<img alt="$1.4 billion USDC moved to Coinbase | Source: Analyst on X" class="size-full wp-image-290453" height="645" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GJ1PpLyWAAAqADu.jpg?resize=1024%2C645" width="1024" />
<h2>Are Bitcoin And Ethereum Ready To Turn The Corner?</h2>
<p>Looking at Bitcoin and Ethereum, it is evident that sellers might be in control, rejecting attempts for higher highs. Bitcoin trades below the $71,600 resistance level, marking March 28 highs. </p>

<p>On the other hand, Ethereum is yet to fully capitalize on <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-fees-spike-but-relief-on-the-horizon/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">post-Dencun</a> expectations to break higher, above $3,700. The coin remains under pressure, with the odds of falling below $3,200 a possibility if bulls fail to flow back.</p>
<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/x/lpwVhFIF/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Bitcoin price trending upward on the daily chart | Source: BTCUSDT on Binance, TradingView" class="size-full" height="904" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/lpwVhFIF/" width="1787" /></a>
<p>The analyst believes that the influx of USDC into Coinbase indicates a growing willingness among investors to enter the crypto market. Stablecoins have emerged as preferred conduits for traditional finance capital to flow to crypto. </p>
<p>Popular stablecoins like USDT and USDC are backed by fiat and can be redeemed for cash. Usually, stablecoin inflows into the exchange are seen as a positive development, a net positive for crypto, and mostly leading assets.</p>
<h2>Will History Repeat? Past USDC Inflows Lifted Price</h2>
<p>Still, while prices might expand in the coming sessions, the fact that $1.4 billion USDC was channeled into Coinbase can&#8217;t be the main fuel. The crypto and Bitcoin or Ethereum markets have deep liquidity, with sentiment mostly or big money injection from institutions as primary drivers of price. </p>
<img alt="Previous USDC inflow | Source: Analyst on X" class="size-full wp-image-290454" height="496" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GJ1RHk1XwAAlnrb.jpg?resize=1024%2C496" width="1024" />
<p>Even so, the general confidence is warranted. This isn&#8217;t the first time a bulk USDC transfer to Coinbase has coincided with a crypto upswing. In January 2023, the analyst <a href="https://twitter.com/JA_Maartun/status/1773663212359102812" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">notes</a>, a $1.3 billion USDC inflow to Coinbase preceded a price spike that saw the coin rise from around $16,300. </p>
<p>Therefore, with this historical precedent in mind, traders are bullish and expect a possible recovery for Bitcoin and Ethereum. </p>

<p>USDC has been steadily gaining traction and is now poised to potentially dethrone XRP as the world&#8217;s sixth most valuable crypto. According to CoinMarketCap data on March 29, USDC has a market cap of $32.5 billion. On the other hand, XRP, the native currency of the XRP Ledger, has a market cap of over $34 billion.</p>

<title>Ripple Shares 2 Major Technical Advances For The XRP Ledger</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。Ripple通过其开发部门RippleX推出了两项重大的技术进步，包括在devnet中推出新版本的以太坊虚拟机（EVM）侧链和对XRPL自动化做市商（AMM）功能的更新。XRPL的EVM侧链为XRPL的互操作性能力带来了显著提升，而AMM功能的修复将于4月11日生效，这是Ripple对XRPL跨境支付和DeFi战略的关键一部分。 <div>
<p>Ripple, through its development arm RippleX, unveiled two significant technological advancements for the XRP Ledger (XRPL). These developments involve the roll-out of a new version for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) sidechain in the devnet and updates to the XRPL&#8217;s Automated Market Maker (AMM) functionality. Both enhancements are pivotal in Ripple&#8217;s strategy to enhance the XRPL&#8217;s capabilities in cross-border payments and decentralized finance (DeFi).</p>
<h2>Ripple And Peersyst Releases New EVM Bridge</h2>
<p>The announcement of the<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-ledger-partnership-to-integrate-smart-contracts/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> EVM sidechain,</a> a collaborative effort between Peersyst Technology and Ripple, marks a notable milestone in the XRPL&#8217;s evolution. Through a statement shared by Peersyst Technology via X (formerly Twitter), the companies highlighted the completion of a significant update for the EVM sidechain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Exciting milestone reached on the EVM Sidechain! We are very excited to release the new version of the bridge with a new scalable interface for future #XRPLedger interoperability,&#8221; Peersyst Technology announced. This development introduces a scalable interface that promises to significantly enhance the XRPL&#8217;s interoperability capabilities.</p>

<p></p>
<p>It is designed to accommodate multiple networks, wallets for each network, and various tokens for each pair of networks. Moreover, it introduces the ability for dynamic bridge creation by users for any ERC20/IOU token, facilitating permissionless cross-chain applications with any asset. &#8220;This will allow us to add to the portal all the networks that have bridges with #XRPL and list multiple wallets for all these networks.</p>
<p>The development of the XRPL EVM sidechain has been structured into three phases, starting with its launch on the XRPL devnet (in October 2022) and culminating in the introduction of a permissionless EVM sidechain connected to the XRPL mainnet (<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-sidechain-xrp-ledger-close-to-launch/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">to be announced</a>). This phased approach ensures thorough testing and scalability assessments, paving the way for a robust framework that supports increased participation and interoperability with other blockchain networks.</p>
XRP Ledger AMM Feature To Be Activated On April 11
<p>On another front, RippleX communicated a vital update regarding the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-cto-xrp-price-amm-feature/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">XRPL AMM feature</a>. An amendment to fix a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-ledger-amm-problems/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">discovered bug</a> has achieved over 80% consensus for activation, a development expected to take effect on April 11. RippleX urged node and validator operators to update their infrastructure to rippled version 2.1.1, emphasizing the importance of this update for the continued smooth operation of the XRPL AMM feature.</p>

<p>In a recent <a href="https://dev.to/ripplexdev/update-on-the-xrp-ledger-amm-bug-and-the-path-forward-hkb" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Brad Chase, a developer at RippleX, detailed the events leading up to the discovery and resolution of the bug. &#8220;Last Friday, after over two years in the making, XLS-30, the Automated Market Maker (AMM) amendment, went live on XRP Ledger mainnet. However, a bug affecting the AMM functionality was discovered the following day,&#8221; he stated.</p>

<p>The bug, identified with the assistance of community members Tequ and Orchestra Finance, involved an inconsistency in how the payment engine interacts with order books and AMM pools, leading to incorrect liquidity draw from an AMM pool in certain scenarios.</p>
<p>The rectification process involved a comprehensive approach, encompassing the development of a fix, extensive testing, and the preparation of the network for the amendment&#8217;s activation. The commitment to transparency and collaboration in addressing the bug was evident in RippleX&#8217;s communication and the mobilization of the XRPL community to mitigate the bug&#8217;s impact and ensure a swift resolution.</p>
<p>At press time, XRP traded at $0.62843.</p>

<title>Shiba Inu Burn Rate Sees Massive 17,000% Surge, How Much SHIB Was Burned?</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-burn-rate-17000/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-burn-rate-17000/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。Shiba Inu的销毁率激增超过17,000%，在24小时内燃烧了5600万SHIB代币。这对SHIB价格有积极影响。Shibarium网络活动下降，需重新启动以促进SHIB代币销毁。SHIB目前以约$0.00003116交易，24小时内上涨超过3%。 <div>
<p>The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-burns-bright-shib/">Shiba Inu (SHIB) burn rate</a> is again on the rise, with the <a href="https://www.shibburn.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">burn tracking website Shibburn</a> highlighting the massive surge in the last 24 hours. This is undoubtedly a welcome development as it could positively impact SHIB’s price, which has made a decent recovery lately. </p>
<h2>Shiba Inu Burn Rate Surges By Over 17,000%</h2>
<p>Shibburn revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/shibburn/status/1773334270657888301?s=20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> that the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-8-billion-shib-burned/#:~:text=Over%208%20Billion%20Shiba%20Inu%20Burned%20In%20The%20Last%2024%20Hours&amp;text=As%20a%20result%20of%20this,transferred%20to%20a%20dead%20wallet." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">SHIB’s burn rate</a> had surged by over 17,000%, with 56 million SHIB tokens burned between March 27 and 28. During that period, 5.3 million SHIB tokens were burnt in a single transaction, contributing significantly to this surge. </p>

<p>SHIB’s burning program was recently one of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-latest-developments-2/#:~:text=Data%20from%20the%20market%20intelligence,to%20209%20since%20June%202023.&amp;text=Meanwhile%2C%20there%20has%20also%20been,addresses%20falling%20under%20this%20category.">major talking points</a> in the SHIB community as <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-0-001-9-25-trillion-shib/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Shiba Inu team member Ragnar</a> drew the community’s attention to how this was setting SHIB up for further growth. So far, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-shib-burns/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">the burn initiative</a> has continued to positively impact SHIB’s price whenever it is carried out on a large scale. </p>
<p>Therefore, sustaining the large-scale burning of these SHIB tokens is necessary. SHIB’s burn rate has continued to be inconsistent, with times when the amount of SHIB burned is largely unimpressive. </p>
<p>It is also worth mentioning that <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-8-billion-shib-burned/#:~:text=Over%208%20Billion%20Shiba%20Inu%20Burned%20In%20The%20Last%2024%20Hours&amp;text=As%20a%20result%20of%20this,transferred%20to%20a%20dead%20wallet." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">SHIB’s burn rate</a> has declined by almost 49% in the last seven days, which again highlights the need for sustained momentum in the burning of these crypto tokens. </p>
<h2>Time For Shibarium To Pick Up Again</h2>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inus-shibarium-hits-new-record-amid-chaotic-market-movements/">Layer-2 network Shibarium</a> looks to be the answer to ensuring a sustained increase in the SHIB burn rate. For context, Shibarium singlehandedly contributed to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-team-executes-4th-burn-to-bring-total-to-nearly-34-billion/">over 33.8 billion SHIB tokens</a> burned in December 2023. Meanwhile, before then, the only time the monthly SHIB burns crossed the 10 billion mark was in May 2023.</p>

<p>Shibarium’s importance is why much effort continues to be put into ensuring that network activity there picks up. Bitcoinist <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shibarium-99-decline/">reported</a> that Shibarium has seen a staggering 99% decline in daily transactions this month. At the time of writing, the network recorded just about 9,000 transactions in the last 24 hours. </p>
<p>That is undoubtedly concerning for a network that averaged over 7 million daily transactions for most of December last year. The surge in network activity was also why the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shib-magazine/">Shiba Inu team</a> was able to burn billions of SHIB tokens that month. </p>
<p>Therefore, network activity on Shibarium needs to pick up soon enough as it could play a major role in helping <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-price-100-0-0001/">SHIB break its all-time high</a> (ATH) and even surpass it. </p>
<p>At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at around $0.00003116, over 3% in the last 24 hours according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/shiba-inu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">data</a> from CoinMarketCap. </p>

<title>Bitcoin Will Hit $150,000 By 2025, According To Investment Firm CEO’s Crypto Crystal Ball</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-will-hit-150000-by-2025-ceo/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-will-hit-150000-by-2025-ceo/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。预测认为比特币价格可能在2025年达到150,000美元，基于Metcalfe定律的网络效应模型，估计其公平价值为50,000美元。尽管即将到来的减半事件可能会导致价格上涨，但近期交易费用的增加可能会在矿工利润方面产生影响。分析师预测减半后的价格在7.5万美元，由于增加的投资者兴趣和对错失机会的恐惧可能引起价格上涨。机构投资者的增加和减半导致供应受限可能推动价格上涨，但确切的价格轨迹仍不清晰。 <div>
<p>With the highly anticipated Bitcoin halving just weeks away, industry pundit Mark Yusko, CEO of Morgan Creek Capital Management, is fueling the fire of investor excitement with a daring price prediction: Bitcoin reaching a staggering $150,000 by 2025.</p>

<h2>Will Bitcoin Register A New ATH?</h2>
<p>Yusko&#8217;s bullish outlook hinges on a combination of factors. He cites Metcalfe&#8217;s law, a network effect model, to estimate the top crypto&#8217;s current &#8220;fair value&#8221; at $50,000.</p>
<p>The upcoming halving, which cuts miner rewards in half, is expected to disrupt supply dynamics and historically has been followed by price surges. However, Yusko acknowledges the emergence of transaction fees as a new wrinkle, potentially mitigating the immediate impact of the halving on miner profitability.</p>

<p>This cycle might be a bit different, Yusko says, referring to the transaction fees generated by Ordinals and Inscriptions, a recent development allowing users to embed data onto the Bitcoin blockchain.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin&#8217;s &#8216;Fair Value&#8217;</h2>
<p>Despite this, he anticipates a fair value of $75,000 post-halving due to factors like increased investor interest and the &#8220;fear of missing out&#8221; (FOMO) that often accompanies such events.</p>
<p>Yusko isn&#8217;t alone in his optimism. Big names like Robert Kiyosaki and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/standard-chartered-sees-bitcoin-200k/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Standard Chartered bank</a> share his belief in a potential $150,000 price target. This sentiment echoes the broader bullish trend in the crypto market, fueled by increasing institutional adoption and the growing recognition of Bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/MB1aqmMg/" width="2475" /></p>

<p>But not everyone is convinced. Bitcoin&#8217;s price history is notoriously volatile, and external factors like regulatory changes or economic downturns can quickly derail even the most well-reasoned predictions. Critics also point out limitations in applying Metcalfe&#8217;s law, originally designed for communication networks, to a complex system like Bitcoin.</p>

Exact Price Trajectory Unclear
<p>The road to $150,000 also remains unclear. While Yusko predicts a significant price increase after the halving, with a potential peak around nine months later (end of 2024), the exact trajectory hinges on a delicate balance between supply and demand.</p>
<p>Increased demand from institutional investors, particularly through vehicles like <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-beats-okx-and-kraken-holdings/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin ETFs</a>, could propel the price upwards. However, this needs to be met by a constrained supply due to the halving.</p>
<p>The price has to rise with more demand than supply, the analyst emphasizes, suggesting a potentially parabolic price movement towards the end of the year. Historically, Bitcoin price peaks have occurred around nine months after halving events, before a subsequent bear market sets in.</p>

<title>Crypto Expert Publishes A Run-Down Of Sam Bankman-Fried’s Lesser Known Activities</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/sam-bankman-fried-activities/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/sam-bankman-fried-activities/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。文章揭示了FTX创始人Sam Bankman-Fried进行的一系列不为人知的链上交易活动，包括售出大量的stETH导致价格崩盘、购买没有实用价值的NFTs、进行洗钱交易操纵市场等行为。他还被指责通过出售35,000万美元的FTT进行抛售，并利用BUG从FTX账户中提取资金。这些举动引发了市场恶意操纵和价格波动，损害了加密货币市场的信誉。 <div>
<p>Coinbase’s Director of Product Strategy &amp; Business Operations and On-chain Sleuth <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-collapse-alameda-usdt/">Conor Grogan</a> recently highlighted some of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-sentenced/">Sam Bankman-Fried’s (SBF)</a> lesser-known activities. These were primarily on-chain transactions that the FTX founder carried out, but they were never brought to light <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-collapse-sam-bankman-fried-trial/">during his trial</a>. </p>
<h2>How Sam Bankman-Fried On-Chain Transactions Harmed Crypto</h2>
<p>Grogan revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/jconorgrogan/status/1773332997590090064?s=20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> that Bankman-Fried, through <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-liquidity-exploding-alameda-gap-no-more/">Alameda Research</a>, sold $75 million of staked ETH (stETH) in January 2022. This led to a massive depeg event, which triggered the bank run on <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/celsius-makes-good-on-promise-begins-distributing-3-billion-to-creditors/">bankrupt crypto lender Celsius</a>. That was also the tail event that brought about the collapse of the bankrupt crypto hedge fund <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/no-apologies-3ac-co-founder-not-sorry-for-crypto-hedge-fund-bankruptcy/">Three Arrows Capital (3AC)</a>.</p>

<p>Bankman-Fried is also said to have used <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/ftx/sam-bankman-fried-100m-political-favors/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">FTX customer funds</a> to purchase a bunch of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) that didn’t necessarily have any utility, including CarolineDAO NFTs. CarolineDAO proudly claimed to be “SimpDAO for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/craziest-stories-ftx-sbf-caroline-ellison/">Caroline Ellison</a>,” the former CEO of Alameda Research and Bankman-Fried’s ex-girlfriend.   </p>
<p>Grogan further revealed that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/blockfi-resolves-dispute-with-ftx-alameda-research/">Bankman-Fried and Alameda Research</a> engaged in thousands of wash-trading transactions to boost the visibility of SBF’s holdings. Wash trading is a form of market manipulation in which the same trader buys and sells an asset to give the impression that there is demand for it. </p>
<p>Alameda, being a market maker and with FTX customers&#8217; funds at its disposal, had enough capital to manipulate the market. At some point, the trading firm was said to have had more trading activity than MEV bots. </p>
<p>Another way Sam Bankman-Fried tried to play the market was when the FTX founder’s ‘test’ NFT was created and sold for $270,000, with Grogan speculating that it was most likely bought by SBF himself using customers’ funds. <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-sentenced/">Bankman-Fried</a> was also at it again when he received 2 million RAY tokens and proceeded to sell part of them, even though they were meant to be vested. </p>
<h2>More On Bankman-Fried’s On-Chain Activity</h2>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-exchange-listing/">Shiba Inu (SHIB)</a> was also caught in the mix as Bankman-Fried is said to have helped the token’s price skyrocket while building a large position. He eventually <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-transactions-spree/">offloaded his SHIB tokens</a>, which caused the meme coin to plummet. Interestingly, this happened when FTX had just expanded its SHIB perpetual, meaning SBF possibly shorted the meme coin, too. </p>

<p>SHIB wasn’t the only crypto token that Sam Bankman-Fried aggressively dumped. Grogan revealed that the FTX founder offloaded 35,000 <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sushi-head-chef-requests-funds-for-legal-defense/">SUSHI tokens</a> while lying about not having dumped or shortened the coin. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftt-token-volatility-remains-high/">FTT token</a> he “invented” also played a massive role in his on-chain transactions as he wrapped and rewrapped the exchange’s utility token to gain more liquidity. That explains why Sam Bankman-Fried, almost every week, publicly shilled FTT and pretended to TWAP the token. </p>
<p>Grogan also mentioned that Bankman-Fried wasn’t active on-chain until the crimes started. Alameda wallets, in particular, weren’t very active until FTX’s Director of Engineering <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-ex-chief-engineer-under-probe/">Nishad Singh</a> created the bug, which enabled the trading firm to withdraw unlimited sums from FTX’s account. </p>

<title>Ethereum Spot ETFs Odds At A Pessimistic 25%: Bloomberg Analyst</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-spot-etfs-odds-at-a-pessimistic-25/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-spot-etfs-odds-at-a-pessimistic-25/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。<br />分析师认为在5月批准以太坊ETF的可能性不断减弱，已经下调产品批准概率至25%。Bitwise投资公司提交了ETH ETF申请，并进行了相关性分析以模拟SEC的评估过程。尽管一些人认为这是批准的迹象，但专家仍然持怀疑态度，认为批准可能性仍然很低。SEC在5月截止日期前仍然保持沉默，加重了不确定性。 <div>
<p>Analysts&#8217; optimism on the likelihood of<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/approval-denial-ethereum-etf-sell-the-news-event/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> Ethereum Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) approval </a>in May is constantly waning, as the once optimistic senior Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas has lowered his prediction for the products being approved to a mere 25%.</p>
<h2>Ethereum Spot ETFs Odds Continues To Drop</h2>
<p>Eric Balchunas, who noted that his chances of having an Ethereum ETF approved in May by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are still a bleak 25%, expressed his pessimism in an X <a href="https://x.com/EricBalchunas/status/1773455316081934825?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>. According to Balchunas, he would probably go lower if he could do so, suggesting how uncertain the analyst is towards the products.</p>

<p>The Bloomberg expert&#8217;s insights coincide with his colleague James Seyffart&#8217;s post regarding Bitwise Invest&#8217;s latest Ethereum ETF filling. On Thursday, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-giant-bitwise-shakes-bitcoin-etf-world-lands/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitwise</a> Invest registered shares of its ETH ETF with the SEC using a Form S-1 registration statement, which is its first stage of applying for the exchange products.</p>
<p>A 19b-4 form, announcing the firm&#8217;s intention to list the ETF on a stock exchange, was filed after this one. Bitwise plans to issue shares of the ETH investment vehicle on NYSE Arca, according to the 19b-4 modification filing that was submitted to the SEC.</p>
<p>Both filings preceded amid rumors that the SEC was attempting to classify <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-designated-as-commodity-by-cftc/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">ETH</a> as a security under its regulatory scope, raising concerns about future listings of the ETH ETFs. Bitwise Invest is the latest asset company to join the ETH ETF race, indicating the firm&#8217;s confidence about an approval by the May deadline.</p>
<p>Even though some in the cryptocurrency world welcomed this move as a hint that regulations would soon approve it, experts like Eric Balchunas are still not convinced, warning that the likelihood is still slim.</p>
<p>Balchunas stated that he has been getting tagged in tweets about Bitwise&#8217;s latest filing, the ETH Correlation study, and other ETH ETF hopium. Despite his high regard for the developments, he still believes that the odds for approval are very low.</p>
<p>Furthermore, with seven weeks remaining until the May deadline, Balchunas noted that the SEC&#8217;s radio silence is still depressing. &#8220;Again, personally I want them to approve but I also want to get the call right so we will be a perfect 4 for 4 in crypto ETF predictions,&#8221; he added.</p>
<h2>New Correlation As Part Of Bitwise&#8217;s ETH ETF Filing</h2>
<p>It is worth noting that Bitwise&#8217;s recent spot Ethereum ETF filing <a href="https://x.com/BitwiseInvest/status/1773427635919458551?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">includes</a> the release of a new correlation analysis. This marks the first ETH correlation analysis to imitate the precise assessment process of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-difficulty-drops-miners-expand-halving/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin (BTC)</a> by the SEC, providing a promising outcome.</p>

<p>Several studies were conducted by Bitwise in order to mirror the SEC&#8217;s evaluation of Bitcoin specifically. These include the same 2.5-year sample period, exact intraday correlation intervals, the same correlation statistic, and others.</p>
<p>For hourly, one-minute, and five-minute correlations, the differences in correlation values across the whole sample period are limited to 0.2%, 8%, and 5%, respectively.</p>

<title>Ethereum Founder Buterin Lays Out ‘What Else Memecoins Could Be’</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-founder-buterin-whatmemecoins-could-be/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-founder-buterin-whatmemecoins-could-be/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章提到以太坊创始人Vitalik Buterin对memecoins的未来进行了愿景描述，挑战加密社区重新思考其潜力。他批评了当前memecoins的状态，并提出创新路径。他介绍了“慈善币”概念，支持慈善事业，并倡导将memecoins整合到区块链游戏中，通过“罗宾汉游戏”支持公共物品。他呼吁加密社区更加细致地评估项目，支持那些符合其价值观的倡议。 <div>
<p>In a <a href="https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/03/29/memecoins.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, has laid out a vision for the future of memecoins that challenges the crypto community to rethink their potential beyond mere speculative assets. Titled &#8220;What Else Could Memecoins Be?&#8221;, published on March 29, 2024, Buterin&#8217;s comprehensive analysis not only critiques the current state of memecoins but also proposes innovative pathways for their evolution.</p>
<h2>Ethereum Founder Is Disappointed With Memecoins</h2>
<p>Reflecting on the genesis of his thinking around digital currencies, Buterin recounts, &#8220;Ten years ago, two weeks before the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/elon-musk-queries-ethereum-founder-buterin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ethereum project</a> was publicly announced, I published this post [&#8230;] arguing that issuing coins could be a new way to fund important public projects.&#8221; He envisioned digital currencies like AntiCancerCoin or ClimateCoin as mechanisms through which societal contributions could be directed towards significant causes, thereby leveraging blockchain technology for the public good.</p>
<p>The discourse around <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/3-meme-coins-1000-return/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">memecoins today,</a> however, has deviated significantly from such ideals, Buterin notes. The resurgence of meme coins has been marked not by innovation but by controversy, including instances of overt racism within certain Solana meme coin projects.</p>

<p>This trend has stirred discontent within the crypto space, leading figures like Ethereum philosopher Polynya to express severe disillusionment. Buterin quotes Polynya&#8217;s reaction to underscore the depth of the community&#8217;s unease: &#8220;Even long-time Ethereum philosopher Polynya is very very unhappy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seeking solutions to this quandary, Buterin introduces the concept of &#8220;charity coins&#8221; — cryptocurrencies where a substantial portion of the token supply is allocated to charitable endeavors. He reminisces about past initiatives like &#8220;GiveWell Inu,&#8221; which supported effective altruism through GiveWell, and &#8220;Fable of the Dragon Tyrant,&#8221; aimed at funding anti-aging research among other causes.</p>
<p>Despite mixed results and challenges, such as the dissolution of GiveWell Inu and community issues with &#8220;Fable of the Dragon Tyrant,&#8221; Buterin sees potential in the idea. He recalls the positive impact of donating half the supply of the Dogelon Mars token to the Methuselah Foundation, highlighting the benefits of aligning cryptocurrency projects with charitable causes.</p>
Integration Into Blockchain Gaming
<p>Expanding on this idea, Buterin advocates for the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/blockchain-gaming-a-614-billion-industry-by-2030/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">integration of gaming</a> into the memecoin ecosystem through what he terms &#8220;Robin Hood games.&#8221; These games would not only offer entertainment but also provide a means of supporting public goods and enabling financial gains for participants, especially those from lower-income backgrounds.</p>

<p>He emphasizes the importance of creating genuinely engaging and enjoyable games, critiquing and praising the play-to-earn model exemplified by Axie Infinity for its mixed outcomes. Buterin is particularly enthusiastic about the potential for these games to democratize cryptocurrency participation, offering a unique blend of fun, financial opportunity, and societal contribution.</p>
<p>He states, &#8220;Don&#8217;t just make a coin, make a game. But make an actually meaningful and fun game. Don&#8217;t think Candy Crush on the blockchain; think World of Warcraft on the blockchain.&#8221;</p>
<p>In his concluding remarks, Buterin calls for a more nuanced approach to evaluating crypto projects, urging the community to recognize and support initiatives that align with their values, even if they stem from traditionally criticized sectors. He advocates for a crypto space that is not only more inclusive and entertaining but also one that actively contributes to the betterment of society.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>I have zero enthusiasm for coins named after totalitarian political movements, scams, rugpulls or anything that feels exciting in month N but leaves everyone upset in month N+1. [&#8230;] At the least, more good memecoins than bad ones, ideally those that support public goods instead of just enriching insiders and creators.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>At press time, ETH traded at $3,530.</p>

<title>FTX Founder Sam Bankman-Fried Gets 25 Years Prison Sentence – Details</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-founder-sam-bankman-fried-gets-25-years-in-jail/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-founder-sam-bankman-fried-gets-25-years-in-jail/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。一名加密公司创始人因策划其FTX交易所的瓦解而被法院判刑25年。虽然量刑较重，但可能获得减刑。通过良好表现和《第一步法案》，他可能减刑至12.5年。判决也引发了关于白领犯罪刑罚公平性的讨论。判决对加密货币业发出警告，并对监管机构增加监管压力。 <div>
<p>Disgraced crypto entrepreneur<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/2024/mar/28/sam-bankman-fried-prison-crypto-regulation" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) faces a hefty 25-year prison sentence</a> for masterminding the spectacular collapse of his FTX exchange, a Manhattan court ruled on Thursday. The sentence, though significant, represents only the opening chapter in a saga likely to continue through appeals and potential early release considerations.</p>

<p>Judge Lewis Kaplan highlighted the risk of <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/sam-bankman-fried-sentenced-thursday-financial-fraud/story?id=108554809" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">SBF</a> repeating his crimes, stating, &#8220;There is a risk that this man will be in a position to do something very bad in the future, and it&#8217;s not a trivial risk.&#8221;</p>
<p>Prosecutors echoed this concern, suggesting SBF&#8217;s ambition for political influence fueled his financial misdeeds.</p>
<h2><strong>On Good Behavior And Short Prison Terms</strong></h2>
<p>While the 25-year term falls short of the 40-50 years requested by prosecutors, it places SBF among the most severely punished white-collar criminals. However, a closer look reveals a potential silver lining for the fallen crypto king. Federal good behavior credits and the First Step Act, a prison reform bill, could significantly reduce his sentence.</p>
<p>Mitchell Epner, a former federal prosecutor, explained that Sam Bankman-Fried could serve as little as 12.5 years with good behavior and the First Step Act&#8217;s potential 50% reduction for nonviolent crimes.</p>
<p>This benefit, originally intended for minority drug offenders, has raised concerns about discrepancies in sentencing for white-collar criminals who typically receive lighter sentences already.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/w98nsabz/" width="1835" /></p>

<p>&#8220;It has turned out to be an enormous boon for white-collar criminal defendants,&#8221; stated Epner, highlighting a potential unintended consequence of the reform act.</p>
<p>Another possibility for early release lies in extraordinary medical circumstances or serving a substantial portion of the sentence. While these are less likely scenarios, they remain options for the legal team of Sam Bankman-Fried to explore.</p>
<p>Beyond the prison term, Judge Kaplan ordered a hefty $11 billion forfeiture, a symbolic move aimed at recouping some of the investors&#8217; losses. Additionally, Kaplan recommended placing SBF in a medium-security facility near his family in San Francisco, a small concession amidst the harsh sentence.</p>
<h2><strong>Parents Of Sam Bankman-Fried To Continue Fighting For Their Son</strong></h2>
<p>Undeterred, SBF&#8217;s parents expressed their unwavering support, stating, &#8220;We are heartbroken and will continue to fight for our son.&#8221; Furthermore, SBF&#8217;s legal team confirmed plans to appeal the conviction, indicating a lengthy legal battle on the horizon.</p>

<p>This landmark sentencing serves as a stark warning to the once-booming cryptocurrency industry. The lack of regulations and oversight within the crypto sphere exposed vulnerabilities that SBF ruthlessly exploited.</p>
<p>Moving forward, regulators will likely face increased pressure to implement stricter controls to prevent similar catastrophes.</p>
<p>The saga of Sam Bankman-Fried also raises critical questions about the fairness of the justice system. The potential for significant sentence reduction through the First Step Act highlights potential gaps in how white-collar crimes are punished compared to other offenses.</p>

<h2>What Are Bitcoin Runes?</h2>
<p>Runes introduce a novel fungible token protocol on Bitcoin, utilizing an indexer-based model that builds upon the social consensus mechanisms first popularized by the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-ordinals-craze-throws-up-challenges-and-opportunities-for-the-network/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ordinals</a> initiative. This new protocol facilitates the etching, minting, and transferring of Bitcoin-native digital commodities, potentially altering the landscape of how digital assets are created and exchanged on the Bitcoin network.</p>

<p>According to analysis by ren (wassie arc) (@0xren_cf) from Electric Capital, <a href="https://twitter.com/0xren_cf/status/1773397548222337468" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">shared</a> via X (formerly Twitter), &#8220;The biggest update since Ordinals is coming to BTC at the halvening&#8230; RUNES.&#8221; Ren&#8217;s analysis highlights several key features and improvements that Runes brings to the table:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Simplified Transactions:</strong> Unlike the<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-ordinals-brc-20-tokens/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> BRC-20 token standard</a>, which requires multiple transactions for deployment, minting, and claiming, Runes streamline these operations into a single transaction.</li>
<li><strong>Extendability and Future Proofing:</strong> Runes feature an even-odd field tagging system within their protocol, allowing for future extensions and programmability through soft forks.</li>
<li><strong>Larger Namespace for Tokens:</strong> Runes expand the available character space for token names up to 28 characters, compared to BRC-20&#8217;s four-character limit.</li>
<li><strong>Security Enhancements:</strong> Runes addresses several security concerns, including the prevention of spoofing through the exclusion of Unicode symbols and mitigating the risk of token balance lockup by attackers.</li>
<li><strong>Unique Token Naming:</strong> Runes enforces unique naming for tokens, preventing the creation of tokens with duplicate names. “Rune names shorter than 13 characters will be gradually released over a 4 year period after the runes launch to prevent immediate grabbing of the shortest names,” Ren remarked.</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the most innovative aspects of the Runes protocol is its approach to token issuance and transfer. Utilizing a UTXO-based system, Runes tokens are directly issued into a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/wasabi-coinjoin-blacklisted-utxos-samourai/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">UTXO</a> during the transaction that sets their initial supply, ticker symbol, and decimal precision. This mechanism not only aligns closely with Bitcoin&#8217;s native design principles but also enables more efficient and flexible management of token balances and transfers.</p>

<p>The introduction of Runestones, described as the &#8220;precompiles&#8221; for Runes, further enhances the protocol&#8217;s capabilities. These instructions, stored within the OP_RETURN of a transaction, facilitate the movement of Runes from inputs to outputs and ensure future compatibility through an even-odd tagging system.</p>
<p>However, users are cautioned to be mindful of the specific tags used, as even-tagged Runestones can lead to the effective burning of the involved Runes, a process referred to as creating a &#8220;Cenotaph&#8221; by Rodarmor.</p>
Vision For The Future
<p>Looking forward, the Runes protocol aims to support a wide array of applications and interactions, from intricate inscriptions that could, for example, influence the abilities of digital collectibles based on the amount of a specific Rune held, to facilitating off-chain liquidity pools for Rune trading. This opens up new possibilities for decentralized finance (DeFi) on the Bitcoin network, a prospect that has garnered excitement within the community.</p>
<p>Ordiswap Labs, through a statement on X, emphasized the potential of Runes to enhance the Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem, noting the protocol&#8217;s efficient on-chain footprint and compatibility with existing Bitcoin standards, including the Lightning Network. “Runes aims to provide a simple, Bitcoin-native token system with a unique issuance model and efficient on-chain footprint [&#8230;] Runes are one that we are now specifically looking into, and we cannot be more excited about the potential of the BTC DeFi ecosystem in the coming months!”</p>

<p>TL;DR: Runes aims to provide a simple, Bitcoin-native token system with a unique issuance model and efficient on-chain footprint — its UTXO (unspent transaction output) approach differing from standards like BRC-20.</p>

<p></p>
<p>The activation of the Runes protocol is strategically timed to coincide with the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-halving-supply-shock-significant-heres-why/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin halving</a>, with expectations set for a block height of 840,000, around April 20.</p>

<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/snowden-warns-sec-to-lose-in-coinbase-lawsuit/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> 这些信息是积极的。<br /><br />摘要：《爱德华·斯诺登支持Coinbase与SEC法律纠纷》文章介绍了数字隐私倡导人士爱德华·斯诺登对Coinbase与美国证券交易委员会（SEC）之间法律纠纷的看法。一位美国地区法官支持SEC继续对Coinbase提起诉讼，但斯诺登表示SEC可能会在法庭上失败。他认为如果SEC继续以"恶意"行事，他们将在法庭上受到严厉打击。此外，文章还提到Coinbase在自托管钱包服务方面取得了胜利，阻止SEC对Coinbase钱包提起法律诉讼。整体来看，文章探讨了数字货币监管的复杂性和不确定性，以及这场法律纠纷对未来数字资产监管框架的影响。 <div>
<p>Edward Snowden, a prominent figure in the realm of digital privacy advocacy, has recently weighed in on the legal skirmish between Coinbase and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>

<p>In a significant development, a United States district judge has ruled in favor of allowing the SEC to proceed with its lawsuit against Coinbase. This decision emerged as Judge Katherine Failla denied Coinbase’s motion to dismiss the case, citing compelling evidence presented by the SEC indicating potential violations of securities laws through Coinbase&#8217;s trading and staking products.</p>
<h2>Edward Snowden: SEC Will Lose To Coinbase</h2>
<p>Despite this setback for Coinbase, the exchange had anticipated such a ruling. Chief legal officer Paul Grewal conveyed confidence in the company’s legal position, signaling its intent to vigorously contest the lawsuit.</p>
<p>Snowden, a vocal supporter of Coinbase within the crypto community, has <a href="https://uk.investing.com/news/cryptocurrency-news/edward-snowden-predicts-sec-will-lose-so-hard-in-court-against-coinbase-gensler-had-to-approve-bitcoin-etfs-with-tears-in-his-eyes-3405704" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">echoed sentiments favoring the exchange&#8217;s success.</a> While acknowledging the court’s decision to advance the SEC’s case, Snowden drew parallels to previous legal confrontations involving the SEC, suggesting a potential outcome akin to past cases.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/EQOEBiUW/" width="2475" /></p>

<p>He warned that if the SEC continues to act in what he perceives as &#8220;bad faith,&#8221; it could face significant losses in court. Such outcomes might hamper the SEC&#8217;s ability to enforce regulations on crypto-related entities, including its ongoing legal actions against platforms like Binance and Kraken.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">This doesn&#8217;t bother me. If the SEC keeps acting in bad faith like this, they&#8217;re going to lose so hard in court that they&#8217;ll never be able to do this to anyone ever again. Remember when the SEC got spanked so badly that Gensler had to approve BTC ETFs with tears in his eyes? yeah <a href="https://t.co/XWOwmoaICN" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://t.co/XWOwmoaICN</a></p>

<p></p>
<p>In a separate aspect of the legal battle, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/coinbase-scores-big-ex-uk-minister-joins-council/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Coinbase</a> has secured a victory regarding its self-custody wallet service. Judge Failla dismissed the SEC’s claim that Coinbase acted as an unregistered broker by providing customers access to its Coinbase Wallet application.</p>
<h2>Coinbase Vs. SEC: Legal Clash Unveils Crypto Regulatory Maze</h2>
<p>This dismissal effectively prevents the SEC from pursuing legal action against Coinbase concerning its wallet offering. Both parties now have until April 19 to submit a proposed case management plan, marking the continuation of legal proceedings in the case.</p>

<p>Edward Snowden, renowned for his role in leaking classified information about US government surveillance programs in 2013, remains a pivotal figure in advocating for digital privacy and civil liberties. Despite facing legal repercussions in the US, Snowden continues to wield influence in global discussions surrounding privacy rights, surveillance, and government transparency.</p>
<p>The ongoing legal battle between Coinbase and the SEC underscores the complexities and regulatory uncertainties surrounding the cryptocurrency landscape. As the case progresses, it is poised to shape the future regulatory framework governing digital assets in the United States.</p>

<title>Indonesia: Crypto Products Required To Pass On Regulatory Sandbox After New Rule</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/indonesia-crypto-products-required-to-pass-on-regulatory-sandbox-after-new-rule/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/indonesia-crypto-products-required-to-pass-on-regulatory-sandbox-after-new-rule/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />印尼金融监管机构发布了一个新规定，可能会影响该国的加密资产。根据本地报道，公司必须将其产品引入金融服务管理局（OJK）的监管沙盒进行测试。该规定旨在增加金融部门技术创新的发展，并保护用户免受损失和欺诈性投资。OJK要求金融服务机构（FSI）在印尼的监管沙盒中引入新产品和服务，其中包括银行、保险和加密公司。加密公司必须经过监管沙盒评估才能获得在印尼运营的授权。监管沙盒是一个测试机制，旨在确保金融科技创新和金融工具得到负责任的执行和适当的风险管理。同时，印尼在2025年将监督和管理这些资产的职责从大宗商品期货交易管理机构（Bappebti）转移给OJK。 <div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Indonesia’s regulatory agency has issued a new rule that could potentially affect crypto assets in the country. According to local reports, firms must introduce their products to the Financial Services Authority (OJK)’s Regulatory Sandbox.</p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto Assets To Be Tested On Regulatory Sandbox</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Local reports by news media outlet DetikFinance <a href="https://finance.detik.com/fintech/d-7263093/berantas-investasi-bodong-aset-kripto-baru-wajib-masuk-regulatory-sandbox-ojk" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">informed</a> of the new regulatory rule issued by the OJK this week. The rule aims to “increase the development of the technological innovation of the financial sector” and safeguard users from losses and “fraudulent investments.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">OJK’s new measure requires Financial Services Institutions (FSIs) to enter new products and services in Indonesia’s regulatory sandbox. According to the <a href="https://finance.detik.com/fintech/d-7262882/produk-baru-bank-fintech-diimbau-masuk-regulatory-sandbox-ojk-apa-itu" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reports</a>, the regulation includes banking, insurance, and crypto companies that “are guaranteed to be suitable for use by consumers.&#8221;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto firms must be evaluated in the regulatory <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/russia-proposes-legalizing-crypto-for-regulatory-sandboxes/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">sandbox</a> before being authorized to operate in Indonesia. Moreover, crypto products and new business models developed by entities already licensed by the OJK will also need to go through the sandbox.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Executive Head of the Supervisor of Financial Sector Technology Innovation, Digital Financial Assets, and Crypto Assets, Hasan Fawzi, said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I think this is our spirit at OJK, especially in consumer protection and education. We hope that all our regulatory mechanisms will be present and have a direct impact on the prevention of fraudulent investments.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">If companies fail to follow the new requirement and continue to operate, it will be considered unlicensed and the product illegal.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The regulatory sandbox is a testing mechanism to “assess the reliability of business processes, business models, and financial instruments.” Its goal is to ensure that innovation and financial technology <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/blockchain-revolution-china-npc-pushes-development/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">development</a> are carried out responsibly with suitable risk management.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Regulatory Landscape In Indonesia</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This regulatory sandbox requirement is a new development for crypto assets regulations in the country. Furthermore, the supervision and regulation of these assets will be transferred from the Commodity Futures Trading Regulatory Agency (Bappebti) to the OJK starting in 2025. Regarding this matter, Fawzi said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Now this sandbox is a good tool for familiarization of organizers, crypto asset digital finance practitioners, they will get used to how it is regulated by the OJK, on the other hand, we will introduce regulation and supervision at the OJK.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It’s worth noting that Indonesia has received criticism over its regulatory measures in the past. The country’s cautious approach to cryptocurrencies prohibits its use as a direct payment method for goods and services.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Additionally, the crypto’s dual taxation is believed to have potentially hindered the market growth in the country. As <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-indonesia-eyes-changes-in-taxation/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">reported</a> by Bitcoinist, local exchanges expressed their concerns about the high taxes possibly discouraging users’ activity in licensed exchanges.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Nonetheless, Indonesia has one of the highest adoption rates in the world despite its regulatory landscape. Bappebti, the country’s regulator, <a href="https://www.kemendag.go.id/berita/pojok-media/bappebti-targetkan-transaksi-kripto-rp800-triliun-pada-2024" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reported</a> there were over 18.51 million investors throughout 2023, which increased by over 9.8% by February 2024. According to Chainalysis <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/2023-global-crypto-adoption-index/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">data</a>, the Asian country ranks 7th in the 2023 Global Crypto Adoption Index.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Difficulty Drops: Miners Hesitant To Expand Ahead Of Halving?</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-difficulty-drops-miners-expand-halving/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-difficulty-drops-miners-expand-halving/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。根据文章提供的数据，比特币的难度已经下降，这意味着矿工们可能已经停止了扩张。比特币的难度调整约每14天一次，目的是保持区块生产速率在一个恒定水平。最新的难度调整显示了下降，而比特币价格则在约70080美元的水平交易。接下来的比特币减半事件可能会对挖矿经济产生重大影响。 <div>
<p>On-chain data shows the Bitcoin difficulty has seen a drop in the latest network adjustment, suggesting the miners have stopped their expansion.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Difficulty Drops 1% As Hashrate Remains Flat</h2>
<p>The &#8220;<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-mining-difficulty-soars-7-what-does-it-mean/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">difficulty</a>&#8221; is an in-built feature of the Bitcoin network that controls how hard the miners would find it to find blocks on the chain right now. This feature exists because the BTC blockchain intends to keep its &#8220;block production rate&#8221; at a constant rate.</p>
<p>The block production rate refers to the rate at which miners find blocks on the network. As compensation for solving these blocks, the miners receive block rewards.</p>

<p>These rewards serve as the only way to mint more of the cryptocurrency, so the rate at which they are given out equals the production rate of the cryptocurrency itself.</p>
<p>By nature, their BTC value remains fixed (except for during halvings), so the production rate of the asset is directly dependent on the speed at which miners can go through blocks.</p>
<p>When the miners increase their total computing power (known as the &#8220;<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-hashrate-plunges-from-all-time-high-but-why/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">hashrate</a>&#8220;), they become faster at their task and produce blocks faster, thus raising the production rate of the asset.</p>
<p>This is problematic, however, as it means that these chain validators can go through the unmined supply faster and faster, and continuously flood the market with tokens.</p>
<p>Demand-supply dynamics would suggest that such inflation can be disastrous for the value of the asset. And indeed, Satoshi, the creator of the digital asset, recognized this issue.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, the difficulty exists to keep the block production rate constant. This is the solution Satoshi came up with: by controlling how hard miners would find it to mine blocks, the speed boost owing to greater computing power can be negated.</p>
<p>Approximately every 14 days, the network adjusts its difficulty based on the average block time that the blockchain has observed since the previous adjustment. The Bitcoin network aims to keep this value at around a standard rate of 10 mins per block.</p>
<p>The latest such adjustment has occurred during the past day and has resulted in a reduction of difficulty.</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Difficulty" class="alignnone wp-image-290289 size-large aligncenter" height="344" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/chart_84a24d.png?resize=980%2C344" width="980" /></p>

<p>From the chart, it&#8217;s visible that although the Bitcoin difficulty has gone down, the reduction has only been slight: under 1%. This means that the average block time has recently been just a bit less than the 10 minutes per block target.</p>
<p>Earlier, the difficulty had been riding an uptrend and setting new all-time highs, as the miners had been constantly expanding their hashrate.</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Hashrate" class="alignnone wp-image-290290 size-large aligncenter" height="421" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/chart_9739a0.png?resize=980%2C421" width="980" /></p>

<p>The indicator has declined a bit recently, though, which is why the difficulty has gone down. It&#8217;s unclear right now whether this means that the miners are putting their expansion on hold for now or not.</p>
<p>Next month, Bitcoin is set to see a big event that will drastically change the economics of mining: the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/why-bitcoin-halving-could-bring-uncertainty-to-mining-industry/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">halving</a>. Halvings are periodic events coded into the BTC blockchain that permanently slash the block rewards in half.</p>
<p>These events go off after every 210,000 blocks or approximately every four years. The block rewards make up for the majority of the miners&#8217; revenues, so these rewards being cut in half would naturally be quite significant for the miners&#8217; bottom line.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s possible that some miners may not see it worth adding more hashrate now, as the halving may well make it unprofitable for them. Though, the bigger factor in the slowdown of the hashrate may be the fact that the BTC price has also slowed down since setting its new all-time high.</p>
<p>The block rewards obviously go up in value along with the BTC price, so a fresh uptrend in the coming days could encourage some miners to bet more and get new hashrate online, as it has always happened in history.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $70,800, up over 6% in the last seven days.</p>

<title>Hedge Fund Goes Long Bitcoin, Short MicroStrategy: Details</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/hedge-fund-goes-long-bitcoin-short-microstrategy/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/hedge-fund-goes-long-bitcoin-short-microstrategy/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> '<br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的<br />投资基金Kerrisdale Capital提出了一个投资论点：做多比特币的同时做空MicroStrategy股票。他们认为MicroStrategy的股价相对于其基础数字货币比特币存在严重的溢价，这导致股票被高估。文章详细解释了这一投资策略的理由，包括MicroStrategy的股价溢价、企业软件业务价值下降以及财务策略的负面影响。市场对此反应批评颇多，但Kerrisdale认为这一策略有理。当前比特币价格为71,519美元。' <div>
<p>Kerrisdale Capital, a hedge fund, today <a href="https://twitter.com/KerrisdaleCap/status/1773337285062172793" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">disclosed</a> a nuanced investment thesis: going long on Bitcoin while concurrently taking a short position on MicroStrategy shares. This move is predicated on the assessment that MicroStrategy, which has positioned itself as a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/peter-schiff-questions-microstrategys-bitcoin-buys/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">de facto Bitcoin investment vehicle</a>, is trading at a significantly unjustified premium to the underlying cryptocurrency that primarily constitutes its value.</p>
<h2>Long Bitcoin, Short MSTR</h2>
<p>The hedge fund&#8217;s analysis articulates, &#8220;Shares of MicroStrategy have soared amid a recent rise in the price of Bitcoin but, as is often the case with crypto, things have gotten carried away.&#8221; Kerrisdale highlights a critical discrepancy, noting that MicroStrategy&#8217;s stock price implies a BTC value of &#8220;over $177k, i.e., two and a half times the spot price of Bitcoin.&#8221;</p>

<p>Delving into the reasoning behind the premium on MicroStrategy&#8217;s shares, Kerrisdale debunks several arguments that have been made in favor of the company&#8217;s market valuation. The report categorically states, &#8220;None of the reasons commonly provided for MicroStrategy’s relative attractiveness justify paying well over double for the same coin.&#8221; This statement underscores the hedge fund&#8217;s stance on the overvaluation of MicroStrategy in relation to direct BTC exposure.</p>
<p>MicroStrategy, under CEO Michael Saylor&#8217;s leadership since 1989, has aggressively pursued BTC accumulation, making it a central pillar of its investment strategy. From August 2020 to 2023, the company made significant financial maneuvers to increase its holdings, which <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/microstrategy-1-of-all-bitcoin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">now exceed</a> 214,000 BTC.</p>
<p>Kerrisdale&#8217;s valuation approach considers MicroStrategy&#8217;s enterprise software business and its BTC reserves. The analysis concludes that the software business, while still operational, &#8220;no longer contributes meaningful value to the overall enterprise,&#8221; spotlighting the overwhelming influence of Bitcoin on the company&#8217;s valuation.</p>
<p>A key aspect of Kerrisdale&#8217;s critique focuses on the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/microstrategy-bitcoin-cfa-probes-debt-issue/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">inflated</a> premium over Net Asset Value (NAV) attributed to MicroStrategy&#8217;s shares. &#8220;At 2.6x, MicroStrategy’s equity premium is exceptionally high,&#8221; the report states, suggesting an unsustainable market position relative to historical data. Kerrisdale argues that a correction towards a more historically consistent premium would imply a substantial downside for MicroStrategy&#8217;s stock relative to Bitcoin&#8217;s performance.</p>

<p>The report thoroughly examines the potential implications of MicroStrategy&#8217;s financial strategy, including its reliance on leverage and the dilutive effects of its financing mechanisms. Kerrisdale&#8217;s analysis suggests that while MicroStrategy&#8217;s aggressive capital market activities have succeeded in increasing its Bitcoin holdings, they have simultaneously led to a stagnation in the amount of Bitcoin per share, due to the dilutive impact of debt financing and equity offerings.</p>
<p>Concluding, Kerrisdale Capital estimates that &#8220;assuming the current premium of 2.6x contracts to a more historically consistent 1.3x represents 50% downside in MSTR relative to bitcoin.&#8221; This conclusion is drawn from an examination of the interplay between MicroStrategy&#8217;s stock premium, its Bitcoin holdings, and the broader market dynamics.</p>
<p>The reactions from the community were rather critical. Bit Paine (@BitPaine) commented, &#8220;Are you selling advance tickets to your funeral?&#8221;. Another crypto analyst, Trey Sellers (@ts_hodl), stated, &#8220;Seems like a logical position to me, although markets can remain irrational longer than you can stay solvent, as they say.&#8221;</p>
<p>OSF (@osf_rekt) added, &#8220;There is probably nothing more dumb than publishing your mid-curve trade idea to an army of irrational degens who will make it their life mission to liquidate you.&#8221;</p>
<p>At press time, BTC traded at $71,519.</p>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。阿布扎比的经济实力在石油行业中闻名，但现在已经进入区块链技术领域，推出了Venom区块链用于Web3应用程序。Venom区块链具有每秒处理10万笔交易的能力，平均交易费用低至0.0002美元。该项目市值超过52亿美元，交易量超过2亿美元，在推出仅24小时内用户数量就超过100万。已有超过20个项目计划在Venom区块链上推出。阿布扎比成为科技创新摇篮，这些成就标志着科技进步去中心化的重要一步。VENOM代币目前交易价为0.6788美元，过去24小时涨幅超过27%。 <div>
<p>Abu Dhabi, known for its economic strength in the oil industry, has entered the realm of blockchain technology with a team that built the Venom Blockchain for Web3 application, which recently launched worldwide.</p>
<h2>Over 20 Projects Ready To Launch On Venom Blockchain</h2>
<p>The Layer 0 (L0) Venom blockchain differentiates itself with an infrastructure capable of processing 100,000 transactions per second while maintaining a low average transaction fee of $0.0002, according to its <a href="https://venom.foundation/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>.</p>

<title>Shiba Inu Lead Dev Tells Ethereum Founder, ‘It’s Just The Start’, Here’s Why</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-lead-dev-ethereum/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-lead-dev-ethereum/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。Shiba Inu（SHIB）的领头开发者Kusama表示，SHIB生态系统很快将有更多改进。他对Vitalik的肯定回应了对SHIB的赞誉，并表示SHIB还有很大增长空间。SHIB团队成员也对Vitalik的评论做出了回应，强调不要低估这个“暗黑币”，并鼓励社区利用社交媒体展示强大实力。此外，SHIB团队计划在去年收购顶级域名，为SHIB打造未来互联网操作系统。他们还计划推出Shiba Inu ETF，并希望Grayscale考虑提供。目前，SHIB的价格为0.00003122美元，过去24小时上涨近5%。 <div>
<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB) lead developer, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-game-changing/">Shytoshi Kusama</a>, recently told <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-scalability-leap-vitalik-buterin-solution/">Ethereum’s co-founder Vitalik Buterin</a> that he should expect more improvement from the SHIB ecosystem soon. This comes in response to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-founder-shiba-inu/#:~:text=Ethereum&#039;s%20co%2Dfounder%20Vitalik%20Buterin,in%20the%20last%2024%20hours.">Vitalik’s comment</a> in which he praised the meme coin. </p>
<h2>More To Come From SHIB</h2>
<p>Kusama responded to Vitalik in an X (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/ShytoshiKusama/status/1772893993426092357?s=20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, in which he shared a GIF that read, “&#8230; it’s just the start.” The developer was reacting to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-founder-shiba-inu/#:~:text=Ethereum&#039;s%20co%2Dfounder%20Vitalik%20Buterin,in%20the%20last%2024%20hours.">Vitalik’s comment </a>that SHIB has “massively outperformed” his expectations. Vitalik had specifically donated SHIB to the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ai-changes-needed-to-save-humanity/">Future of Life Institute (FLI)</a> and looked to be impressed with how fast the transaction was processed. </p>

<p>However, Kusama’s response is a bold statement to the crypto community about how SHIB has yet to reach its full potential and that more growth should be expected from the crypto token and its ecosystem. Meanwhile, Kusama wasn’t the only member of the Shiba Inu team that reacted to Vitalik’s statement. </p>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shib-2024/">Shiba Inu’s Marketing Lead, Lucie</a>, stated that Vitalik’s praise for SHIB is a great reminder not to underestimate the meme coin and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-message-exchanges/">its community</a>. She also used the opportunity to urge members of the SHIB community to utilize the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shibarium-public/">layer-2 network Shibarium</a> so that everyone in the crypto space can see how strong the community is. </p>
<p>Indeed, the SHIB community, commonly referred to as the ‘SHIB Army,’ has played an <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-team-discloses-projects-true-strength/">integral role</a> in helping SHIB experience such exponential growth since it launched in 2020. In his response to Vitalik, Kusama also reaffirmed this fact by using the hashtag ‘#SHIBARMYSTRONG’ in his post. </p>
<h2>What To Expect From The Shiba Inu Ecosystem</h2>
<p>Last year, Shiba Inu <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-game-changing/">revealed</a> plans to acquire a Top-Level Domain (TLD). This forms part of the Shiba Inu team’s plan to use the crypto token to bridge the gap between the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shaping-tomorrow-agorics-journey-to-empower-web2-developers-into-web3/">Web3 and Web2 space</a>. Back then, Shiba Inu’s partner, D3Inc, noted that this move would be a game-changer as the proposed ‘.shib’ TLD would natively support Web2 and Web3 tools. </p>

<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-dev-shibarium/">Shiba Inu developer Kaal Dhairya</a> added that this was part of their aim to decentralize the internet and make SHIB the “operating system of the future internet.” Interestingly, this move is part of a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shib-2024/">long list of plans</a> the team had outlined at the beginning of the year, which they planned to accomplish. </p>
<p>Although ambitious, the community also <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shib-grayscale-shiba-inu-etf/">launched a petition</a> in February for Grayscale to consider offering a Shiba Inu ETF. </p>
<p>At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at around $0.00003122, up almost 5% in the last 24 hours according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/shiba-inu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">data</a> from CoinMarketCap. </p>

<title>Canadian Authorities Probe $169M QuadrigaCX Crypto Scam In New Wealth Investigation</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/canadian-authorities-probe-169m-quadrigacx-scam/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/canadian-authorities-probe-169m-quadrigacx-scam/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> 摘要：<br /><br />这些信息是消极的。加拿大不列颠哥伦比亚省寻求对加拿大数字货币交易所QuadrigaCX联合创始人Michael Patryn采取未经解释的财富令(UWO)。文章提到政府试图追求QuadrigaCX的相关资产，因其涉及金融欺诈和犯罪活动。文章还详细介绍了QuadrigaCX的历史以及Patryn和另一创始人Cotten之间的涉及。政府声称，如果成功，将没收Patryn等人的资产，并将犯罪所得转入受害者服务计划和犯罪预防项目。 <div>
<p>In a significant development, the Canadian province of British Columbia seeks to employ an unexplained wealth order (UWO) against Michael Patryn, co-founder of the Quadriga Coin Exchange (QuadrigaCX). </p>
<p>The UWO is a newly introduced court order that compels individuals to disclose the source of their assets. The Minister of Public Safety and Attorney General of Canada, Mike Farnworth, said that the <a href="https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2024PSSG0022-000430" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">filing </a>of the UWO demonstrates the government&#8217;s commitment to taking decisive action against criminals and organized crime.</p>
<h2>Government&#8217;s Pursuit Of QuadrigaCX Extends</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/canada-revenues-agency-goes-after-quadrigacx-taxes/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Quadriga Coin Exchange</a>, founded in Canada by Gerald Cotten and Michael Patryn and the focus of British Columbia&#8217;s UWO, gained international notoriety for its criminal activities that caused substantial financial losses to numerous individuals. </p>

<p>Farnworth highlights QuadrigaCX&#8217;s connection to a high-profile cryptocurrency fraud documentary on Netflix as illustrative of the nature of such crimes. The government emphasizes that &#8220;robust&#8221; enforcement measures that undermine criminal organizations&#8217; profit motives are essential to effectively combating these crimes.</p>
<p>In addition, the Attorney General notes that the case received further attention when it was featured in an episode of Law and Order Toronto entitled &#8220;The Key to the Castle: Criminal Intent&#8221; in February 2024. </p>
<p>According to Farnworth&#8217;s statement, if successful, the motion would result in the forfeiture of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/winkevoss-twins-keep-promoting-trust-and-regulation-after-quadrigacx-debacle/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">various assets</a>, including $250,200 in cash, 45 gold bars, four luxury watches, and valuable jewelry. The Attorney General&#8217;s statement concluded:</p>
<blockquote><p>We will continue to take the assets from unlawful activity and redirect the proceeds of crime to much-needed victim services programs and crime prevention initiatives, such as the anti-hate grants to communities announced on Feb. 15, 2024.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Allegations Of Personal Gain From Customer Assets</h2>
<p>While a 2020 report from the Ontario Securities Commission did not result in charges, it concluded that only Gerald Cotten had engaged in fraudulent activities. The report stated that Patryn had ceased associating with QuadrigaCX in 2016, and most client funds were deposited after his departure.</p>
<p>However, in the <a href="https://vancouversun.com/business/bc-files-third-unexplained-wealth-order-case-alleging-cash-gold-linked-to-169-million-quadrigacx-cryptocurrency-fraud" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">civil forfeiture case</a> filed in British Columbia&#8217;s court last year, the province alleged that an investigation revealed Patryn and Cotten had misappropriated customer assets for personal use and financial gain. The province&#8217;s claim mentions Patryn&#8217;s involvement in purchasing and maintaining a safety deposit box and its contents.</p>
<p>Lovie Horner, Patryn&#8217;s common-law spouse, was <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/quadrigacx-linked-bitcoin-on-the-move/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">identified </a>as one of the individuals who deposited money into the bank account between 2014 and 2020, according to the forfeiture case.</p>

<p>In 2005, Michael Patryn, then known as Omar Dhanani, was convicted in the United States for his involvement in a conspiracy to transfer identification documents related to an online money-laundering service.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in December 2018, Gerald Cotten, the co-founder of QuadrigaCX, embarked on a trip to India with his newlywed wife, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/quadrigacx-founders-widow-to-compensate-exchange-hack-victims/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Jennifer Robertson</a>. During the trip, Cotten, who suffers from Crohn&#8217;s disease, became seriously ill. </p>
<p>Despite medical attention, his health deteriorated, leading to his untimely <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/quadrigacx-update-dead-ceo-cotten-embezzled-funds-for-years/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">death </a>shortly after his hospitalization. About a month later, QuadrigaCX officially announced Cotten&#8217;s death in a <a href="https://archive.ph/GAheG" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">statement </a>attributed to Jennifer Robertson.</p>

<title>Top 3 Meme Coins That Can Give A 1,000% Return In The Bull Market</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/3-meme-coins-1000-return/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/3-meme-coins-1000-return/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的<br />在加密货币市场中，迷因币的热度证明它们将在即将到来的牛市中成为推动力。为了在市场中赚钱，投资者在牛市开始之前应该在好的迷因币中定位。本文列出了在牛市中可能获得1,000%回报的前3个迷因币：Myro (MYRO)、ArbDoge AI (AIDOGE)和Bone ShibaSwap (BONE)。这些迷因币具有潜力，可以在牛市中迅速增长，并提供投资者巨大的收益机会。 <div>
<p class="p2">The rave around meme coins and their popularity has proven that they will be a driving force in the upcoming bull market. As such, it is important for investors looking to make money in the market to position in good meme coins before the bull run commences. So, here are the top 3 coins that have the potential for a 1,000% return in the bull market.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Myro (MYRO) Leads Undervalued Meme Coins</h2>
<p class="p2">The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/pepe-wif-bonk-myro-next/">Myro (MYRO) meme coin</a> has been around for a number of months now and has yet to fade from the limelight. It comes as a second chance for investors who missed the run with DogWifHat (WIF), and has followed a similar pattern to WIF as well.</p>

<p class="p2">Just like WIF, Myro has been initially listed by Binance on its futures platform but not on its spot platform. Again, similar to WIF, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-meme-coins-myro-wif/">Myro’s price</a> had surged to a new all-time high following this listing before dropping back down. If it continues to follow this trend, then the meme coin’s price could see a rapid surge to $1 billion on its next leg up.</p>
<p class="p2">Myro is currently in the cycle that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/pepe-wif-bonk-myro-next/">WIF</a> was about a month ago before it rallied. From here, a rally to a $2.5 billion market cap would mean a 1,000% increase for the meme coin, which is a feasible target for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/pepe-wif-bonk-myro-next/">Myro</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="Myro price chart from Tradingview.com (Meme coins)" class="aligncenter size-medium" height="1530" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/7z9xSULj/" width="3286" /></p>

<h2 class="p2">ArbDoge AI (AIDOGE)</h2>
<p class="p2"><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/aidoge-triggers-meme-coin-bull-run/">ArbDoge AI (AIDOGE)</a> is one of the leading meme coins on the Arbitrum network, but what sets it apart is the fact that it has lasted this long in the market. Currently, ArbDoge AI (AIDOGE) seems suppressed by the lack of action on the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/top-meme-coins-across-blockchains/">Arbitrum network</a>. However, once adoption picks up on the network, it is expected to spill over to AIDOGE similar to what happened to Solana-based BONK.</p>
<p class="p2">AIDOGE is trading at less than half the market of Myro at $100 million, which gives it a lot of room to run. So far, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/aidoge-triggers-meme-coin-bull-run/">AIDOGE</a> is the only coin that has shown potential to be the first meme coin to cross the $1 billion market cap milestone on the Arbitrum network.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Bone ShibaSwap (BONE) Can Reach $2 Billion</h2>
<p class="p2">Another meme coin that has the capacity for a 1,000% return is <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-bone-new-target/">Bone ShibaSwap (BONE)</a>, which is part of the Shiba Inu ecosystem. One thing that sets the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bone-binance-shiba-inu-army-campaigns-for-listing/">BONE coin</a> apart from other meme coins is the fact that it is also a utility token.</p>

<p class="p2">The Ethereum Layer 2 network, Shibarium, developed by the Shiba Inu team, uses the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bone-binance-shiba-inu-army-campaigns-for-listing/">BONE token</a> as its fee token. This means that demand is created for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-team-show-how-to-move-bone-to-shibarium/">BONE</a> every time the Shibarium network is used as users need BONE to pay gas fees.</p>
<p class="p2">As the adoption of the Shibarium network continues to rise, so will the demand for the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-bone-new-target/">BONE token</a>. This sort of demand is the driver for coins like Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX), and at only a $209 million market cap, BONE still has a long way to go, given its utility.</p>

<title>Glassnode Data Shows Bitcoin at Crossroads: Time to Hold or Take Profit?</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-at-crossroads-time-to-hold-or-take-profit/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-at-crossroads-time-to-hold-or-take-profit/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。根据Glassnode的链上数据分析，比特币处于一个关键的时刻。当BTC在2024年3月飙升至73,800美元时，创下新的历史高点，比特币市场达到了一个统计上显著的水平，即根据市值与实现值（MVRV）比率。MVRV比率显示了比特币相对于历史价格的昂贵程度，可以帮助判断比特币在当前价格水平下是被高估还是被低估。尽管近期比特币价格下跌至约62,000美元，但整体市场情绪仍然看涨。 CoinStats的恐惧和贪婪指数仍然表现为"极度贪婪"。 <div>
<p>According to on-chain data analysis by Glassnode, Bitcoin is at a critical juncture. When BTC soared to $73,800 in March 2024, printing new all-time highs, the Bitcoin market reached a statistically significant level regarding on-chain unrealized profits, according to the Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV) ratio.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin MVRV Ratio At Historically Significant Level: Time To Hold Or Take Profit?</h2>
<p>The analytics platform <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/glassnode/status/1773014300895949302" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">notes</a> that, historically, such levels have coincided with periods of market resistance. Therein, some holders often choose to take profits by exiting their positions. </p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether the same will be replicated, and prices fall as holders make a profit. However, according to MVRV, this will likely happen if past performance guides.</p>
<img alt="BTC MVRV Bands | Source: Glassnode on X" class="size-full wp-image-290236" height="590" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GJsC_0cXQAAxC9X.jpg?resize=1024%2C590" width="1024" />
<p>Simply put, the MVRV ratio shows how expensive the coin is relative to historical prices. It is a tool for gauging whether Bitcoin, as it is at spot rates, is under or overvalued. When the ratio is above 1, it suggests that it is overvalued.</p>
<p>When BTC rose to approximately $74,000, the MVRV ratio rose above 3. However, it should be noted that it was way lower than historical levels when Bitcoin registered new all-time highs. When BTC rose to $69,000 in 2021, the MVRV ratio was over 5. At the 2017 peak, this value was over 4.8, which is the highest it has been.</p>
<h2>BTC Has Been Under Pressure, Will Prices Recover?</h2>
<p>Recently, Bitcoin has struggled to edge higher, looking at price action in the daily chart. The coin remains below all-time highs of $73,800. Even though bulls shook off selling pressure over the weekend, pushing strongly above resistance levels, the follow-through has not been impressive. </p>
<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/x/XmRmruzB/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Bitcoin price trending upward on the daily chart | Source: BTCUSDT on Binance, TradingView" class="size-full" height="904" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/XmRmruzB/" width="1787" /></a>
<p>Any breakout above $74,000 from the candlestick arrangement will thrust the coin into new territory. Some analysts speculate the coin might float to as high as $100,000 in 2024, especially after the network halves its miner rewards in April 2024.</p>

<p>Despite the recent sell-off pushing prices to around $62,000, the overall market sentiment remains bullish. The CoinStats Fear and Greed Index, a gauge of investor sentiment, still <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://coinstats.app/fear-and-greed/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reads</a> &#8220;Extreme Greed&#8221; at 80.</p>
<img alt="Bitcoin sentiment data | Source: CoinStats" class="size-full wp-image-290233" height="598" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot606.png?resize=1024%2C598" width="1024" />
<p>Additionally, interest is back after days of outflows from spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). By March 27, Lookonchain data <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1773020896329974069" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">shows</a> that Fidelity added added 4,001 BTC. In total, and factoring in GBTC&#8217;s outflow, all spot Bitcoin ETF issuers added 3,469 BTC.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Stablecoins Ratio At 1-Year Lows: Is This Bullish?</title>

<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-stablecoins-ratio-1-year-lows-why-bullish/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章介绍了比特币交易稳定币比率下降至2023年3月以来最低的情况，并解释了该指标对市场的影响。随着比特币交易稳定币比率下降，这可能意味着比特币的卖出供应减少，这可能对价格有利。稳定币的兑换为其他加密货币是对它们价格的支持。最新的指标显示，在2023年中期达到最高点后，市场的潜在卖出压力一直在下降，表明对比特币可能是乐观迹象。最近比特币价格在$70,000以上，仍在这一水平的范围内震荡。 <div>
<p>On-chain data shows the Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio has plunged to its lowest since March 2023. Here&#8217;s what this could mean for BTC.</p>

<p>As explained by an analyst in a CryptoQuant Quicktake <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/660520aac8a6526c1e3e656d-Exchange-Stablecoins-Ratio-at-the-lowest-level-since-March-2023" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, the Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio has been declining recently. The &#8220;Exchange Stablecoins Ratio&#8221; is an indicator that keeps track of the ratio between the Bitcoin and stablecoins exchange reserve.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-exchange-reserves-declined-by-30-in-2022/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">exchange reserve</a> here is the total amount of a given cryptocurrency that all centralized exchanges are holding in their wallets right now. Generally, this part of the supply sitting in these platforms is considered the available trading supply of the asset.</p>

<p>What the trend in this indicator may imply for the market, though, depends on the exact type the cryptocurrency in question is. In the case of volatile assets like Bitcoin, investors may transfer to these platforms when they want to sell.</p>
<p>As such, an increase in the exchange reserve may imply that the available sell supply of the asset has gone up, which could naturally prove to be bearish for the price.</p>
<p>For <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bullish-combo-stablecoin-soars-bitcoin-breaks-50000/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">stablecoins</a>, exchange deposits also imply that investors want to trade from these coins into other assets or fiat. The difference, though, is that a shift of stables into other cryptocurrencies is bullish for their prices, as this swap obviously acts as buying pressure for them.</p>
<p>For this reason, the total exchange reserve of all stablecoins is often considered the available buying supply for the volatile side of the cryptocurrency sector.</p>
<p>Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio over the past few years:</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio" class="aligncenter" height="806" src="https://i0.wp.com/img.cryptoquant.com/331846/quicktake/A2reCRL_afd3709981cc5fb471520fd5b2cbd70d3237b3f0aaafa143b1db34dd1b2b583f.png?resize=1280%2C806&#038;ssl=1" width="1280" /></p>

<p>As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Exchange Stablecoins Ratio has been declining for a while now, but the indicator&#8217;s downtrend has especially sharpened recently.</p>
<p>When this indicator has a low value, it means that the BTC exchange reserve is low in comparison to that of all stablecoins right now. Since this may correspond to the &#8216;sell supply&#8217; of the asset being lower than the &#8216;buy supply&#8217;, the indicator assuming such a value can be bullish for BTC.</p>

<p>According to this indicator, the potential selling pressure in the market had risen to its peak in mid-2023, but it has been on its way down since then. So far, the metric has retraced back to levels observed in March 2023.</p>
<p>The latest values of the indicator are still high when compared to those observed during the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/why-the-2022-crypto-bear-market-is-different/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">2022 bear market</a> lows, but the fact that they are only going down may be an optimistic sign.</p>
<p>That said, in the current post-ETF environment, it&#8217;s unclear how relevant the exchange reserves are now (and therefore, the indicator), as the ETFs offer a different avenue into Bitcoin, for which demand has been significant so far.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>Since its initial surge beyond the $70,000 mark, Bitcoin has been stuck in consolidation during the last few days, as it&#8217;s still trading around this level.</p>

<title>Shiba Inu Team Launches Latest Edition Of The SHIB Magazine</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shib-magazine/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shib-magazine/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。<br />Shiba Inu Magazine发布了第18期，介绍了DAMN，这是最新的梗币整合进Shibarium生态系统。文章重点介绍了这个代币的最新发展和更新，强调了其在加密空间中的卓越表现。文章还详细介绍了DAMN的诞生背景，以及它如何成为Shibarium网络中的主要角色。此外，文章还探讨了DAMN作为梗币的独特特点，如何推动Shibarium生态系统的发展。 <div>
<p>The<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-latest-shib-magazine/"> Shiba Inu team</a> has published the 18th edition of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/manny-pacquiao-shib-magazine/">The Shib Magazine</a>, featuring DAMN, the newest meme coin integrated into the Shibarium ecosystem. The publication emphasizes the latest developments and updates on the token, accentuating its impressive achievements and performance in the crypto space.</p>
<h2>Shiba Inu Magazine Unveils The Solana Killer, DAMN</h2>
<p>On Wednesday, March 27, The SHIB team released the latest edition of its <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-team-shib-magazine/">magazine</a>, focusing exclusively on the SOL Killer, DAMN. Highlighting the rapidly growing popularity of the cryptocurrency, The Shib Magazine disclosed that DAMN has become one of the major <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-is-europes-2nd-most-beloved-crypto/">meme coins of interest to investors</a> in the crypto space. </p>

<p>Delving deep into the story behind DAMN’s inception, the Magazine revealed that Woof, a pseudonymous developer of WoofSwap, a community-driven Decentralized Exchange (DEX), had been the first to introduce the idea of creating a new <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-investing-meme-coins/">meme coin</a> exclusively for the Shibarium network. Taking advantage of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/meme-coin-madness-sends-ethereum-fees-soaring/">recent hype on meme coins in the market</a>, the developers proceeded to create DAMN, recognizing the market’s interest in meme coins as an opportunity for explosive growth. </p>
<p>According to the magazine, DAMN was a token created through the general collaboration of the entire <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-shibarium-public/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Shiba Inu community</a>. After its successful inception, developers relinquished ownership of the meme coin, burning all <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/liquidity-providers-the-good-the-bad-and-its-wonderfully-bizarre-future/">Liquidity Provider (LP)</a> tokens in order to enhance transparency and improve security by eradicating the potential for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/rug-pull-layer-2-project-suffers-500-eth-exploit/">rug pulls</a> and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-community-scams/">scams</a>.  </p>
<p>In an effort to <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-shib-0-0008-ath/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">bolster the cryptocurrency’s adoption</a> and elevate its visibility, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-latest-developments-2/">the Shiba Inu army</a> had united in support of the meme coin, promoting it through social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter) and submitting requests to leading cryptocurrency aggregators such as CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. </p>
<p>As a result, DAMN underwent a substantial growth spurt, skyrocketing by more than 500% and reaching a trading volume of over $3 million within five days of its launch. The cryptocurrency has garnered considerable attention and engagement within the crypto community, capitalizing on the heightened demand for new and potentially lucrative meme coins to propel itself to new heights. </p>
<h2>DAMN’s Unique Qualities As A Meme Coin</h2>
<p>One of the unique characteristics of DAMN as a meme coin is its inherent ability to bolster the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shibarium-new-partner/">Shibarium ecosystem</a>. As the cryptocurrency gains momentum, it shines the spotlight on Shibarium, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shibarium-breaks-the-internet-again-with-over-400-million-layer-2-transactions/">boosting the network’s popularity</a> and adoption. </p>

<p>According to The Shib magazine, DAMN has been one of the key players in Shibarium’s rapid growth lately. The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-outperform-dogecoin/">Shiba Inu</a> Layer 2 blockchain solution has witnessed a major increase in its Total Value Locked (TVL), <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Shibarium" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">achieving</a> an impressive high of $3.79 million, at the time of writing. </p>
<p>DAMN has also played a potential role in boosting the network activity within the Shibarium ecosystem. The Layer 2 blockchain recently <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shibarium-network-2/">recorded a series of milestones</a>, attributed to the introduction of its new meme coin and the ecosystem’s resilience and steadily growing user base.</p>

<title>Maximum Sentence: Judge Suggests Sam Bankman-Fried Could Face 110 Years In Prison</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/sam-bankman-fried-could-face-110-years-in-prison/</link>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。在加密货币世界中引起轰动的庭审中，FTX交易所联合创始人Sam Bankman-Fried被判阻碍司法和伪证罪。法官指出他的犯罪严重性，损失超过数十亿美元，可能面临长达110年的监禁。Bankman-Fried对犯罪造成的影响表示忏悔，案件涉及的悲剧事件也引起了关注。交易所欺诈行为对投资者、债权人和客户都造成了重大影响。 <div>
<p>In a courtroom drama that has captivated the cryptocurrency world, the sentencing day for Sam Bankman-Fried, co-founder of the now-bankrupt crypto exchange FTX, has arrived. As the hearing unfolded, it became increasingly clear that the fallen crypto mogul could be handed the harshest punishment.</p>
<h2>Sam Bankman-Fried Found Guilty Of Obstruction And Perjury</h2>
<p>During the <a href="https://x.com/innercitypress/status/1773369173533466627?s=20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">live coverage</a> of the sentencing by Inner City Press, Judge Lewis A. Kaplan&#8217;s remarks shed light on the severity of Bankman-Fried&#8217;s crimes. The judge adopted the pre-sentence report and addressed the substantial disputes surrounding the sentencing guidelines.</p>
<p>Judge Kaplan pointed out that investors, lenders, and customers were all victims of Bankman-Fried&#8217;s fraudulent activities. These crimes included misappropriating FTX customer funds for speculative investments by Alameda and engaging in illicit activities. The judge emphasized that any fortuitous gains from the rise in cryptocurrency values did not diminish the gravity of the offenses committed.</p>

<p>Regarding the loss amount, Judge Kaplan stated that the loss exceeded the $550 million threshold, with investors losing $1.7 billion, lenders losing $1.3 billion, and customers suffering losses of $8 billion. </p>
<p>Additionally, the judge found Bankman-Fried guilty of obstruction of justice, citing his text messages to the former general counsel as attempted witness tampering. Based on the trial testimony, the judge also made three perjury findings, highlighting Bankman-Fried&#8217;s false statements regarding his knowledge of Alameda&#8217;s use of FTX customer funds.</p>
<h2>Tragic Fallout Of FTX Fraud</h2>
<p>As Sam Bankman-Fried addressed the courtroom, he expressed remorse for his actions&#8217; impact on FTX customers and colleagues. He acknowledged the losses suffered by customers and their prolonged wait for resolution. Bankman-Fried also mentioned the dangers faced by Alameda and his efforts to salvage the situation, including receiving an “anonymous” message offering advice.</p>
<p>Bankman-Fried acknowledged his understanding of how the prosecutors perceived him, the court, and the media, referencing his earlier attempts to help the general counsel. </p>
<p>Sam Bankman-Fried expressed regret for not being able to do more to ensure that customers, lenders, and investors were appropriately compensated. Despite his statements, the judge&#8217;s remarks earlier indicated that the potential sentence could still be severe.</p>

<p>According to Inner City Press, the judge stated that Bankman-Fried&#8217;s guideline in the case is life imprisonment, which may amount to a maximum of 1,320 months (110 years). </p>
<p>The case has also been marred by tragic outcomes, with victims, such as Sunil, criticizing the liquidator for the handling of creditor&#8217;s rights and alleged suicides linked to the FTX fraud.</p>
<p>As this high-profile case reaches its conclusion, the crypto community awaits the final verdict that will determine Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s fate. His actions have left a significant impact on investors, lenders, and customers alike.</p>

<title>Crypto Crackdown: US, UK Zero In On Hamas Funds In Gaza</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-crackdown-us-uk-zero-in-on-hamas-funds/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-crackdown-us-uk-zero-in-on-hamas-funds/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。美国和英国同时采取行动，对涉嫌为哈马斯提供资金的互联网媒体平台Gaza Now实施制裁。制裁措施主要针对Gaza Now的幕后策划者Mustafa Ayash，以及与该组织筹款活动相关的各个个人和实体。随着对10月7日在以色列发生的袭击事件后Gaza Now筹款举措的深入调查，加密货币在恐怖主义融资中的使用受到关注。美国和英国强调全球合作在解决这些问题方面的重要性。同时，该组织通过加密货币募集了超过1.3亿美元，表明恐怖组织利用数字资产进行融资的问题引起了关注。伊朗向哈马斯和巴勒斯坦伊斯兰圣战组织提供国际资金支持。 <div>
<p>In a synchronized move aimed at disrupting the financial infrastructure backing Hamas, the United States and the United Kingdom have taken decisive action by imposing sanctions on Gaza Now, an internet-based media platform allegedly involved in financing the militant group.</p>
<p>The focal point of these sanctions is directed towards Mustafa Ayash, the mastermind behind Gaza Now, alongside various individuals and entities connected to the organization&#8217;s fundraising endeavors.</p>
<p>The decision to implement these measures stemmed from an extensive inquiry into Gaza Now&#8217;s fundraising initiatives subsequent to the occurrence of an assault in Israel on October 7th.</p>
<h2><strong>Cryptocurrency In Terrorism Financing</strong></h2>







<p>Following the occurrence of the October 7 incident, the investigation was set into motion as Gaza Now embraced cryptocurrency contributions.</p>
<p>The utilization of digital assets in terrorist financing came under scrutiny when Elliptic, a blockchain analytics company, discovered a donation worth $21,000, showcasing the involvement of cryptocurrencies in such activities.</p>







<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Does the media &amp; fundraising site ‘Gaza Now’ ring a bell?</p>
<p>It’s being pushed by numerous celebrities and world leaders.</p>
<p>Well guess what? The U.S. Department of Treasury just sanctioned it for providing material support to Hamas! <a href="https://t.co/UGNYNtZgA1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/UGNYNtZgA1</a></p>
<p>— StopAntisemitism (@StopAntisemites) <a href="https://twitter.com/StopAntisemites/status/1773043314461126848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">March 27, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>To address the challenges posed by the limited use of cryptocurrencies in terrorist financing, there is a growing recognition for a reevaluation of strategies and tools in combatting terrorism financing.</p>
<p>Authorities and regulatory bodies must enhance monitoring capabilities and establish more effective regulatory mechanisms within the digital currency space.</p>

<p>The preference for specific cryptocurrencies, such as Tether on the TRON blockchain, is driven by attributes like low transaction fees and perceived anonymity, highlighting the complexities faced in countering terrorism financing in the digital age.</p>
<p>The sanctions imposed by the US and UK form part of a wider international approach to counter the financing of terrorism. Both countries&#8217; Treasury Departments emphasize the importance of global collaboration in addressing these issues.</p>
<p>In addition to the sanctions, the UK has implemented a comprehensive asset freeze on individuals and entities associated with Gaza Now to reinforce the principle that the financial system should not be exploited for terrorist activities.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/cJ5OBGRX/" width="1835" /></p>

<p>The sanctions imposed on Gaza Now and its affiliates demonstrate a firm stance against entities involved in financing terrorism. The US and UK aim to disrupt the financial networks supporting Hamas through these measures, thereby weakening their operations and capabilities. The sanctions serve as a clear message that any attempt to exploit the financial system for illicit activities will face severe consequences.</p>

<p>In countering terrorism financing in the digital age, specific challenges arise, including the anonymity of cryptocurrencies, the lack of regulatory frameworks, the proliferation of cryptocurrency exchanges, the use of privacy-focused cryptocurrencies, sophisticated money laundering techniques, and the need for collaboration and information sharing.</p>
<h2><strong>Gaza Groups Raise Over $130 Million In Crypto Since 2021</strong></h2>
<p>Since at least 2019, Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) have made an effort to <a href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/gazan-terror-groups-raised-over-130-million-in-crypto-to-fund-attack/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">raise money through cryptocurrencies</a> in an effort to obtain funds outside of the most popular means of financial transfers. Restrictions on access to the international banking system result from the groups&#8217; designation as terrorist organizations in Israel, the US, and other Western countries.</p>
<p>According to estimates, since 2021, terrorist organizations in Gaza have raised over $130 million in cryptocurrencies, with $41 million coming from Hamas and $93 million from Palestinian Islamic Jihad.</p>
<p>Defence Minister Yoav Gallant has disclosed that Iran provides the lion&#8217;s share of international money to the terror groups operating in Gaza. The country has financed the PIJ with tens of millions of dollars annually and Hamas with about $100 million each year.</p>

<title>Solana’s Future Clouded By Coinbase-SEC Ruling, Says Crypto Lawyer</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/solana-future-clouded-by-coinbase-sec-ruling/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/solana-future-clouded-by-coinbase-sec-ruling/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。美国纽约南区地方法官Katherine Polk Failla对Coinbase的驳回决定可能会影响Solana的未来，由于SEC对其进行调查。法官指出Solana（SOL）可能被认定为证券，表明SEC认为Solana等加密资产是证券。此外，文章详细介绍了Solana的运营历史和筹资方式，探讨了其可能被视为投资合同的可能性，这可能对Solana的市场动态和监管产生重大影响。在此消息发布后，Solana的价格出现急剧下跌，虽然稍后得以回升。 <div>
<p>On Wednesday, the future of Solana may have been clouded by United States Southern District of New York&#8217;s Judge Katherine Polk Failla with her <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/breaking-coinbase-sec-case-reaches-critical-point/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">decision</a> against Coinbase&#8217;s motion to dismiss. The ruling enables the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to advance its case against the crypto exchange giant. The case centers on allegations that Coinbase has been operating as an unregistered exchange, broker, and clearing agency, and its Staking Program constitutes the unregistered offer and sale of securities.</p>
<h2>Solana (SOL) Is A Security: Judge Failla</h2>
<p>The implications of this ruling extend far beyond Coinbase, striking a chord, particularly with the Solana community. The judge&#8217;s mention of SOL (and Chilliz (CHZ)) in the context of the lawsuit highlights the SEC&#8217;s position that both crypto assets are securities. Notably, the agency only has to prove that at least one of the 13 named tokens is a security, and Judge Failla specifically chose SOL (and CHZ) as an example to agree with the SEC’s arguments.</p>

<p>Bill Morgan, a pro-XRP lawyer, offered a detailed <a href="https://twitter.com/Belisarius2020/status/1772996762703388825" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">commentary</a> on the ruling via X (formerly known as Twitter), drawing attention to the critical examination of SOL. Morgan stated, &#8220;One of these was Solana. She found that the SEC plausibly asserts that Coinbase facilitated transactions in crypto-asset ‘securities’. She clearly found that the SEC had plausibly argued sales of SOL were securities and did not accept sales on secondary markets were not securities.&#8221;</p>
<p>This observation underscores the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-clo-coinbase-vs-sec-is-far-from-over/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">heightened regulatory scrutiny</a> and potential reclassification risks facing Solana and similar tokens. Morgan added, “It is a setback for Coinbase and does not look good for SOL sales not being found to be investment contracts. Seriously, if Coinbase was consistent in its reaction to the filing of the SEC v Ripple case in delisting XRP it would now delist SOL.&#8221;</p>
<p>In her <a href="https://twitter.com/CardanoSpot/status/1773071584263057809" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">ruling</a>, Judge Failla detailed SOL&#8217;s operational history and its efforts to raise capital, thus framing the context for its potential classification as a security. &#8220;SOL&#8221; is described as a crypto-asset that is the native token of the Solana blockchain, a network designed to support decentralized applications (dApps) and characterized by its high transaction speeds and scalability.</p>

<p>The judge noted, &#8220;To raise capital, Solana Labs conducted a series of initial offerings of SOL to institutional investors. Between May 2018 and early March 2020, initial investors were provided with &#8220;sale and issuances rights to receive [SOL] tokens in the future via a Simple Agreement for Future Tokens (SAFTs). Through these offers and sales, Solana sold approximately 177 million SOL, raising over $23 million. Later in March 2020, Solana Labs conducted additional SOL sales on the CoinList trading platform in a &#8220;Dutch auction.”</p>
<p>This assessment not only underscores the magnitude of Solana&#8217;s fundraising efforts but also aligns with the criteria of an investment contract under the Howey Test—a benchmark for determining whether a transaction qualifies as a security. If SOL is adjudged to meet these criteria, the implications for SOL could be profound.</p>
<p>The classification of SOL as a security could introduce significant regulatory burdens and reshape its market dynamics.</p>
<p>Just last week, Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder of Solana Labs, expressed his support for Ethereum amid escalating regulatory scrutiny. His statement, shared via X, came after it became known that the SEC is scrutinizing the Ethereum Foundation for a potential classification as a security. “If the state is against ethereum then I am against the state,” he stated.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">If the state is against ethereum then I am against the state</p>
<p>&mdash; toly <img alt="🇺🇸" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f1fa-1f1f8.png" style="height: 1em;" /> (@aeyakovenko) <a href="https://twitter.com/aeyakovenko/status/1770622972937839081?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">March 21, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>It is also important to note that the SEC called Solana a security also in the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sec-sues-binance-and-ceo-for-securities-fraud/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Binance lawsuit</a>, alongside other altcoins like Polygon, Cardano, Filecoin, Cosmos Hub, and gaming-centered projects such as The Sandbox, Decentraland, and Axie Infinity in June 2023. To date, the US agency hasn’t taken any action against Solana Labs.</p>
<p>Market response to the ruling was swift, with Solana&#8217;s price witnessing a 5.7% drop, although it managed to recover most of its losses today. At press time, SOL traded at $185.</p>

<title>FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried To Be Sentenced Today: Here’s What To Expect</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-sentenced/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-sentenced/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的<br />即将进行对前FTX前CEO Sam Bankman-Fried的判决，可能面临100年监禁。法官Lewis Kaplan将决定他的刑期，辩方要求5至6.5年监禁，控方则要求40至50年。FTX的CEO指控SBF在法庭陈述中撒谎，称FTX并非资不抵债。审判将在纽约时间上午9:30开始。 <div>
<p>The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftxs-sam-bankman-fried-should-receive-50-year-jail/">long-awaited sentencing</a> of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-collapse-sam-bankman-fried-trial/">Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF)</a>, the former CEO of the defunct crypto exchange FTX, is set to take place on March 28. SBF faces the possibility of spending up to 100 years in prison or as little as five years if Judge Lewis Kaplan somehow gives in to the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-fraud/#:~:text=Bankman%2DFried&#039;s%20Lawyers%20Propose%20A,six%20and%20a%20half%20years).">demands of the defendant’s lawyers</a>. </p>
<h2>What To Expect From The Sam Bankman-Fried Sentencing</h2>
<p>Judge Kaplan will determine how many years <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-collapse-sam-bankman-fried-trial/">Bankman-Fried</a> will spend in prison. The FTX founder was <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-convicted/">found guilty last year</a> of all the seven charges that were leveled against him. However, this will not be easy for the judge, who has received compelling sentencing submissions from both the defendant and the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/ftx/sam-bankman-fried-100m-political-favors/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">prosecution</a>.</p>

<p>On the one hand, Bankman-Fried’s lawyers have <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-fraud/#:~:text=Bankman%2DFried&#039;s%20Lawyers%20Propose%20A,six%20and%20a%20half%20years).">proposed</a> that their client receive a sentence between 63 months (5 years) and 78 months (six and a half years). They believe this is a “just sentence” for the defendant as that is enough time to rehabilitate him and ensure that he returns promptly to society where he serves more use than in prison. </p>
<p>On the other hand, the prosecution has <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftxs-sam-bankman-fried-should-receive-50-year-jail/">proposed</a> that Sam Bankman-Fried get a sentence between 40 and 50 years. They argue that such a sentence will be “sufficiently severe” to deter others from committing such crimes. They also believe that this will be enough to ensure that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-court/">Bankman-Fried</a> doesn’t get the opportunity to defraud anyone again. </p>
<p>In the build-up to the sentencing, both parties have also tried to appeal to Judge Kaplan’s emotions. On the defendant’s part, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-fraud/">SBF’s lawyers</a> have <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/66631291/418/united-states-v-bankman-fried/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">filed letters</a> from various individuals who have clamored for the Judge to temper justice with mercy. Meanwhile, the prosecution has filed <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/66631291/421/united-states-v-bankman-fried/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">victim impact statements</a>, hoping this will again reaffirm the severity of SBF’s crimes. </p>
<h2>FTX’s CEO Calls Bankman-Fried A Liar</h2>
<p>FTX’s CEO, John J. Ray III, addressed a <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/66631291/415/united-states-v-bankman-fried/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">letter</a> to the court on behalf of the creditor victims, seeking to correct “material misstatements and omissions” made by Bankman-Fried in his <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-fraud/#:~:text=Bankman%2DFried&#039;s%20Lawyers%20Propose%20A,six%20and%20a%20half%20years).">sentencing submission</a>. One such misstatement was when Sam Bankman-Fried asserted that FTX was solvent when it <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/major-reveals-from-the-ftx-bankruptcy-filing-whats-the-takeaway/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">filed for bankruptcy</a>.</p>

<p>John J. Ray III stated that SBF’s claim is “categorically, callously, and demonstrably false.” He also branded claims that customers’ funds were not lost as a lie. According to him, it is through the efforts of the restructuring team that they were able to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-repayment-plan-bitcoin-valued-at-16000/">recover monies</a> belonging to customers. </p>
<p>Ray’s statement undoubtedly puts a dent in the plea for leniency in Bankman-Fried’s sentencing. Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s lawyers had argued that their client should be given a sentence as low as five years since the money belonging to <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/ftx/sam-bankman-fried-100m-political-favors/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">FTX’s customers</a> was never really missing, and they didn’t suffer any loss since they would be repaid.</p>
<p>Bankman-Fried&#8217;s sentencing will begin at 9:30 am ET in New York. </p>

<title>Ripple Vs. SEC Saga: Legal Expert Unravels The “Bigger Argument”</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bigger-argument-in-ripple-vs-us-sec-case/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bigger-argument-in-ripple-vs-us-sec-case/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章讨论了Ripple与SEC之间的法律纠纷，重点关注了SEC在案件中的索赔理论和要求。前律所创始人詹姆斯·墨菲认为，SEC需要证明XRP销售中存在实际损失，否则无法获得返还金额。SEC要求Ripple支付20亿美元的罚款，其中包括近20亿美元的退赔和罚款以及近2亿美元的预期利润。Ripple首席执行官布拉德·加林豪斯批评SEC的做法，并表示将继续披露其回应的情况。 <div>
<p>Former founder and chairman of Murphy and McGonigle law firm James A. Murphy, also known as MetaLawMan, has delved into the legal battle between <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-sec-judge-questions-regulators/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</a>, offering his perspective on the bigger argument in the case.</p>
<h2>Bigger Argument Within The Ripple Vs. SEC Case</h2>
<p>James Murphy revealed his insights on the legal dispute in an <a href="https://x.com/MetaLawMan/status/1773103415712747820?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">interview</a> with Scott Melker on the Wolf where he examined the SEC&#8217;s damages theory in the case. According to Murphy, Ripple recently had a very lucky break, which he perceives as the bigger argument in the court case.</p>

<p>He then drew attention to a previous ruling by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, which states that the SEC must prove misconduct by naming actual money-losing victims or something identified as pecuniary harm in order for there to be a disgorgement.</p>
<p>He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Second Circuit Court of Appeals ruled at the end of last year that in order for there to be a disgorgement, there have to be victims of the frauds, victims of the securities law violation. There has to be something called the pecuniary harm that means actual losses.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, applying this statement to the SEC&#8217;s filing on the damages theory, Murphy asserted that a piece of the filing mentioned the presence of pecuniary harm in XRP sales, but they do not correspond to a single purchase of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-lawsuit-ripple-sec-agreement-schedule/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">XRP</a>.</p>
<p>Generally, the SEC&#8217;s lawsuit is predicated on the notion that certain buyers of XRP were adversely affected financially because they purchased the product at a lower price than others. </p>
<p>Consequently, it would be difficult for the court to demonstrate that the proposed $850 million punishment is appropriate in the absence of actual harm evidence. Considering the nature of the case, Murphy believes that the aforementioned figure will be significantly lower when punishment is finally established.</p>
<p>Addressing the concept of disgorgement, Murphy emphasized that in the absence of identifiable victims, the disgorgement that seeks to reimburse those harmed for illegitimate profits becomes unsustainable.</p>
<p>Therefore, there is no $200 million interest since interest triggers a disgorgement. Nonetheless, it is still possible to have a penalty in the absence of victims and disgorgement judgment.</p>
<h2>$2 Billion Fine Request By The SEC</h2>
<p>It is noteworthy that the SEC has filed a motion asking US <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-sec-judge-schedule/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Judge Torres Analisa</a> to grant its requested fine of about $2 billion from Ripple as its final judgment against the payment firm.</p>

<p>The regulatory watchdog is requesting $1,950,768,364 in total from <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/march-26-pivotal-for-ripple-xrp/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ripple</a>. Specifically, the grant would propel Ripple to pay $876,308,712 in disgorgement and demand a civil penalty of $876,308,712 and prejudgment interest of $198,150,940. </p>
<p>So far, Ripple Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Brad Garlinghouse has criticized the agency regarding the move. Garlinghouse slammed the SEC, saying that this had never been done before and that he and the firm would keep exposing the Commission to what it is when they respond to the motion.</p>

<title>FTX Fallout: Victims’ Stories Pile Up As Sam Bankman-Fried Faces Judge</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-victims-stories-pile-up-as-sbf-faces-judge/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-victims-stories-pile-up-as-sbf-faces-judge/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。FTX加密交易所创始人Sam Bankman-Fried的即将宣判引发了多方面的影响。美国司法部提交了52份受害者声明，描绘了生活被颠覆和梦想破灭的画面。受害者包括一名失去全部400万美元存款的前FTX信用委员会成员，一名在FTX中投入全部储蓄的受害者，以及一名在两次加密平台倒闭后遭受严重心理创伤的受害者。这些受害者的故事凸显了FTX倒闭的人道成本，呼吁更多的监管和保护措施。<br /> <div>
<p>The upcoming sentencing of Sam Bankman-Fried, founder of the now-bankrupt FTX cryptocurrency exchange, is taking on a new dimension as the emotional and financial wreckage left behind by the company&#8217;s collapse comes to light.</p>

<p>The US Department of Justice submitted 52 <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940.419.1_1.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">victim impact statements</a> to the court, painting a grim picture of lives upended and dreams shattered. A former member of the FTX Unsecured Creditors Committee detailed the loss of his entire $4 million life savings, forcing him out of work and into a deep depression. The incident, according to his statement, even strained his marriage.</p>
<h2>FTX Victims Reveal Their Miseries</h2>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">DOJ has submitted further 52 Victim statements</p>
<p>Well done to everyone

<p></p>
<p>For an Italian woman, the collapse of the crypto exchange was a brutal double blow. Having previously lost funds in another crypto platform, Celsius Network, she saw FTX as a safe haven. However, the exchange&#8217;s demise triggered severe mental trauma, further impacting her marriage.</p>
<p>Another victim recounted how he poured his savings into FTX, lured by the exchange&#8217;s high-profile advertising and the promise of a future business venture. Now, with FTX gone, those dreams have vanished.</p>
<p>These are just a few of the harrowing stories emerging, each highlighting the human cost of the FTX debacle.</p>
<p>Beyond the financial losses, the statements reveal a deep sense of betrayal. Victims trusted the company, a seemingly established exchange, only to have their faith shattered.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/6tOGlm9a/" width="2475" /></p>

<p>Many argue that the current legal proceedings fail to adequately address their needs. One victim, for instance, stressed the importance of valuing lost assets based on their current market value, not just their worth at the time of FTX&#8217;s bankruptcy filing.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a glimmer of hope, however. The recent sale of FTX&#8217;s shares in artificial intelligence firm Anthropic for $884 million could provide a source of funds for potential reimbursement. However, the path to full compensation for victims remains unclear, and the legal complexities of asset valuation and distribution are sure to present significant challenges.</p>
<h2>DOJ Recommends 50 Years For SBF</h2>
<p>This human cost of the FTX collapse serves as a stark reminder of the risks associated with cryptocurrency investments. While the potential for high returns exists, the lack of robust regulations can leave investors vulnerable. The FTX saga underscores the urgent need for increased oversight and investor protection in the evolving world of digital assets.</p>

<p>The DOJ&#8217;s sentencing memorandum recommends a prison term of 40 to 50 years for Bankman-Fried, who was convicted of seven fraud and conspiracy charges in November.</p>
<p> Bankman-Fried&#8217;s defense team, on the other hand, is advocating for a lighter sentence of no more than 6.5 years. The sentencing is scheduled for 9:30 a.m. ET on March 28, as Judge Lewis Kaplan nears a decision on the case.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, victims look to Kaplan to consider their emotional and financial hardships when sentencing the former FTX big boss, Sam Bankman-Fried. They also hope their stories will push the Federal Court towards a more victim-centric approach to compensation.</p>
<p>Whether justice can truly be served for those whose lives have been irrevocably altered by the FTX collapse remains to be seen.</p>

<title>Ripple CLO Says Coinbase Vs. SEC Is ‘Far From Over’, Here’s What’s Next</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-clo-coinbase-vs-sec-is-far-from-over/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-clo-coinbase-vs-sec-is-far-from-over/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br /> 这些信息是负面的。文章介绍了南纽约联邦法院法官Failla驳回了Coinbase对证券交易委员会(SEC)指控的动议。尽管此举对Coinbase是个挫折，但瑞波(Ripple)首席法律官仍持乐观态度，并认为这场法律战还处于早期阶段。法院将设置完整的发现时间表，双方都可以要求文件。Coinbase可能会在法律团队的战略判断下考虑提起“中间上诉”，但可能会面临困难。COIN在新闻爆出后下跌大约9%。 <div>
<p>On Wednesday, Judge Failla from the Southern District Court of New York <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/breaking-coinbase-sec-case-reaches-critical-point/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">denied</a> Coinbase&#8217;s motion to dismiss the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s (SEC) case against the exchange. The SEC accuses Coinbase of operating as an unregistered exchange, broker, clearing agency, and alleges that its Staking Program engages in the unregistered offer and sale of securities.</p>
<h2>Ripple CLO Remains Optimistic</h2>
<p>Despite this setback for Coinbase, Ripple&#8217;s Chief Legal Officer, Stuart Alderoty, suggests that this legal battle is only in its initial stages.</p>
<p>Alderoty remarked via X (formerly Twitter), &#8220;A quick knock out punch would have been nice, but at the end of the day, the wheels of justice move slowly, eventually siding with the good guys. The CB Judge gave the SEC the benefit of doubt at this early stage &#8211; as she must. This is far from over.&#8221;</p>

<p>His comments echo the sentiments of Coinbase&#8217;s Chief Legal Officer, Paul Grewal, who also took to X to <a href="https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1772993916146479193" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">express</a> his views: &#8220;Today, the Court decided that our SEC case will move forward on most of the claims, but dismissed the claims against Coinbase Wallet. We were prepared for this, and we look forward to uncovering more about the SEC’s internal views and discussions on crypto regulation. [&#8230;] Looking ahead, we remain confident in our legal arguments and are eager for the opportunity to take discovery from the SEC for the first time.&#8221;</p>
<h2>What’s Next For Coinbase Vs. SEC</h2>
<p>The question of what lies ahead for Coinbase in the aftermath of Judge Failla’s ruling has been a topic of considerable interest. Eleanor Terrett, a journalist with FOX Business, <a href="https://twitter.com/EleanorTerrett/status/1773081763314541040" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">shed light</a> on the subsequent steps: “NEW: So what’s next for Coinbase following Judge Failla’s ruling? The Court will set a full discovery schedule and each side can request documents for the discovery process.</p>
<p>Terrett added, &#8220;Sources familiar tell me: ‘Some of this case could be undermined and exposed through discovery so Coinbase will attempt to get as much discovery on the SEC as they can during this process, and the SEC will do the same.’”</p>

<p>She also drew parallels to the discovery process in the Ripple case, which provided unprecedented insights into the SEC’s internal viewpoints on Ripple and the broader cryptocurrency market. The process of discovery, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-sec-filed-their-pleadings-dates-to-watch/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">summary judgment</a> brief filings, and the possibility of a trial suggests that the legal proceedings between Coinbase and the SEC will extend well over a year.</p>
<p>In the interim, Coinbase might explore the option of filing an “interlocutory appeal” against some or all parts of the motion to dismiss denial, based on the strategic judgment of its legal team. This route was <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-sec-key-dates-post-interlocutory-win/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">previously attempted by the SEC</a> in the Ripple case following Judge Torres’s summary judgment decision, although it was ultimately unsuccessful due to the stringent criteria for interlocutory appeals prior to final judgments.</p>
<p>Carlo.eth, a prominent member of the Ethereum community and defense lawyer, commented on the strategic importance of the discovery phase for Coinbase: “I think Coinbase welcomes the chance at full discovery to get a good look under the SEC’s hood. Will likely give them a lot of momentum going into the summary judgment phase.”</p>
<p>At press time, COIN traded at $256.7, down roughly -9% since the news broke.</p>

<title>House GOP Pressures SEC To Clarify Ethereum’s Security Designation For Prometheum’s Custody</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/house-gop-pressures-sec-to-clarify-ethereum/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。在共和党议员的联合努力下，他们呼吁SEC主席Gary Gensler进一步澄清机构对以太坊（ETH）的托管立场。议员们重点强调SEC和商品期货交易委员会（CFTC）先前承认以太坊为非证券数字资产。他们批评SEC缺乏对数字资产分类的明确定义，并呼吁加快解决数字资产分类的监管不确定性。议员们敦促Gensler主席尽快解决这些问题，以促进数字资产生态系统的增长。SEC尚未对这封信做出正式回应，但行业期待着数字资产监管环境的进一步发展。 <div>
<p>In a joint effort, Republican lawmakers led by House Financial Services Committee Chair Patrick McHenry and House Agriculture Committee Chair Glenn Thompson have called upon Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler to provide further clarification on the agency&#8217;s stance regarding the custody of Ethereum (ETH) by <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-controversy-republican-gensler-prometheums/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Prometheum</a>. </p>
<p>The lawmakers, including Representatives French Hill, Dusty Johnson, Tom Emmer, and Warren Davidson, expressed concerns over the lack of transparency in the SEC&#8217;s Special Purpose Broker-Dealer (SPBD) regime and the potential ramifications of allowing Prometheum to proceed with its <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-spot-etf-expert-predicts-approval-odds/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">custody services</a> for ETH.</p>
<h2>Recognition Of Ethereum As Non-Security</h2>
<p>In their <a href="https://agriculture.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=7749" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">letter </a>sent on Tuesday, the lawmakers emphasized the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission&#8217;s (CFTC) previous recognition of Ethereum as a non-security digital asset. </p>
<p>Based on this precedent, they pointed out that the SEC&#8217;s current regulatory framework does not permit SPBD custody of non-security digital assets. The lawmakers also warned that allowing Prometheum to proceed under these circumstances could have “irreparable consequences” for the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/uk-embraces-crypto-bitcoin-and-ethereum-etns-coming-to-london-stock-exchange/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">digital asset markets</a>.</p>

<p>The Republican lawmakers urged Chair Gensler to clarify the SEC&#8217;s position on several key aspects, including the ability of SPBDs to custody non-securities, the SEC&#8217;s approach to addressing SPBD non-compliance, Ethereum&#8217;s regulatory classification, and the SEC&#8217;s specific stance regarding Prometheum&#8217;s recent announcement.</p>
<p>The letter further raised concerns about the lack of a clear definition for &#8220;digital asset securities&#8221; and the SEC&#8217;s failure to provide comprehensive guidance or propose rules for asset classification within the digital asset marketplace. </p>
<p>The lawmakers also expressed their disappointment with Chair Gensler&#8217;s refusal to acknowledge Ethereum as a<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/elon-musk-queries-ethereum-founder-buterin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> non-security</a> digital asset, stating that his “unwillingness” to clarify the treatment of ETH has contributed to the confusion and uncertainty surrounding its classification.</p>
<h2>Lawmakers Urge Resolution</h2>
<p>The lawmakers criticized the SEC for creating &#8220;uncertainty&#8221; among regulated entities by failing to identify which digital assets should be considered &#8220;digital asset securities.&#8221; </p>
<p>They referenced temporary frameworks established to facilitate trading and custodial services for digital asset securities. The SEC&#8217;s Division of Trading and Markets issued a no-action letter to FINRA in September 2020 outlining conditions for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sec-delays-decision-on-grayscales-ethereum-etf-here/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">registered broker-dealers</a> to operate an Alternative Trading System (ATS) trading digital asset securities. The letter further reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>Despite this history of recognizing Ethereum as a non-security digital asset, you have consistently refused to acknowledge that ETH is not a security. In your March 2023 testimony before the House Committee on Financial Services you declined to answer multiple questions about whether ETH should be considered a commodity. Your unwillingness to clarify the treatment of ETH only exacerbates the confusion and uncertainty regarding ETH’s classification as demonstrated by the Prometheum announcement.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, the letter stressed the need for regulatory clarity and a comprehensive approach to digital asset classification to minimize uncertainty and foster growth within the digital asset ecosystem. </p>
<p>They called on Chair Gensler to address their concerns promptly, considering the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-ceo-predicts-sec-setback-in-ethereum-case/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">potential implications</a> for market participants and the broader digital asset markets. </p>

<p>Chair Gensler and the SEC have yet to respond to the letter formally, but the industry awaits further developments as the regulatory landscape for digital assets continues to evolve.</p>

<title>Change Of Heart? Gaming Platform Security Breach Ends With $62M In Crypto Returned</title>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。文章揭示了加密社区中另一起被盗事件，Munchables平台的开发者内部实施了一起窃取资金的计划。攻击者通过利用智能合约的易升级特性，私自获取大额以太币余额，导致总价值接近1亿美元的资金被盗。虽然攻击者原本似乎是朝鲜人，并被揭露出与Lazarus组织的关联，但最终归还了资金，可能是受到ZackXBT的调查和威胁的影响。整个事件构成了一场惊心动魄的加密世界惊悚片。 <div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In the late hours of Tuesday, the crypto community saw another exploit. Munchables, the Ethereum Layer-2 NFT gaming platform, reported being compromised on an X post.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The crypto heist, which momentarily stole over $62 million, took a shocking turn of events after the attacker’s identity opened a Pandora’s box.</p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto Developer Turns Hacker</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Yesterday, Munchables, a gaming platform powered by Blast, suffered a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-gaming-platform-playdapp-hit-double-exploit/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">security breach</a> that resulted in the theft of 17,400 ETH, worth around $62.5 million. Immediately after the X announcement, crypto detective ZachXBT revealed the sum stolen and the address where the funds had been sent.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It was later informed that the crypto heist had been an inside job instead of an external one, as one of the project’s developers seemed to be responsible.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Solidity developer 0xQuit shared on X concerning information about Munchable. The developer pointed out that the smart contract was a “dangerously upgradeable proxy with an unverified implementation contract.”</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">the Munchables exploit has been planned since deploy.</p>
<p>Munchables is a dangerously upgradeable proxy, and it has been upgraded.</p>
<p>Instead of upgrading from a benign implementation to a malicious one, they did the reverse here</p>
<p>1/<img alt="🧵" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f9f5.png" style="height: 1em;" /></p>

<p></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The exploit seemingly wasn’t “nothing complex” as it consisted of asking the contract for the stolen funds. However, it required the attacker to be an authorized party, confirming that the heist was a scheme carried out inside the project.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">After a deep dive into the matter, 0xQuit concluded that the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/is-your-crypto-safe-trezor-addresses-concerns-over-hack-claims-sophisticated-phishing-scam/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">attack</a> had been plotted since deployment. Munchable’s developer used the contract&#8217;s upgradable nature to “assign himself an enormous ether balance before changing the contract implementation to one that appeared legit.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The developer “simply withdrew the balance” when the total value locked (TVL) was high enough. DeFiLlama data shows that, before the exploit, Munchables had a TLV of $96.16 million. At writing time, the TVL has plummeted to $34.05 million.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As reported by BlockSec, the funds were sent to a multi-sig wallet. The attacker eventually shared all private keys with the Munchables team. The keys gave access to $62.5 million in ETH, 73 WETH, and the owner key, which contained the rest of the project’s funds. According to Solidity developer’s calculations, the total amount neared $100 million.</p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Change Of Heart Or Fear Of The Crypto Community?</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Unfortunately, crypto exploits, hacks, and scams are common in the industry. Most play out similarly, with hackers taking massive sums and investors looking at their empty pockets.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This time, the incident turned out more thrilling than usual, as the identity of the developer-turned-hacker untangled a web of lies and deception. As ZachXBT suggested, Munchable’s rogue developer was North Korean, seemingly tied to the Lazarus group.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">However, the movie doesn’t end there: the blockchain investigator <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1772845175875772552" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">revealed</a> that four different developers hired by Munchables’ team were linked to the exploiter, and it seemed like they were all the same person.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">These developers recommended each other for the job and regularly transferred payments to the same two exchange deposit addresses, funding each other wallets. Journalist Laura Shin suggested the possibility of the developers not being the same person but different people working for the same entity, North Korea’s <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/surge-in-north-korean-crypto-attacks-hacks-2023/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">government</a>.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Pixelcraft Studios CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/coderdannn/status/1772820871478223074" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">added</a> that he had done a trial hire with this developer in 2022. During the month the ex-Munchables developer worked for them, he exhibited practices “sketchy af.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The CEO believes that the North Korean link is possible. Additionally, he revealed that the MO was similar back then, as the developer tried to get “his friend” hired.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">An X user highlighted that the developer’s GitHub name was “grudev325,” pointing out that “gru” could be related to Russia’s Federal Agency for Foreign Military Intelligence.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Pixelcrafts’s CEO commented that, at the time, the developer explained that the nickname was born after his love for the character Gru from the Despicable Me movies. Ironically, the character in question is a supervillain who spends most of the movie trying to steal the moon.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Whether he was trying to steal the moon and failed like Gru, the developer ultimately returned the funds without asking for “compensation.” Many users believe that the suspicious “change of heart” results from ZackXBT’s deep dive into the attacker’s web of lies and the threats made.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This thriller ends with the crypto investigator’s reply to a now-deleted post. In his reply, the detective <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1772751157133287603" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">threatened</a> to destroy the developer and all his “other North Korean devs hard on-chain your country has another blackout.”</p>

<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-exchange-listing/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章介绍了Shiba Inu加密货币在澳大利亚加密货币交易所Bit.com.au上获得重要上市的消息。此举提升了SHIB的知名度，并反映了该加密货币最近蓬勃发展的势头和出色表现。文章详细介绍了此次上市的背景、Bit.com.au的历史和SHIB的增长趋势。这次上市对于澳大利亚投资者来说是一次重要机会，也为SHIB在澳大利亚市场的推广提供了坚实基础。 <div>
<p><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-shibarium-public/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Shiba Inu has gained another remarkable milestone</a> by scoring a major listing on Bit.com.au, an Australian cryptocurrency exchange. This achievement adds to SHIB’s <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-burn-rate-shib-price/">growing list of accomplishments</a>, reflecting the cryptocurrency’s recent surge in momentum and impressive performances.</p>
<h2>Australian Crypto Exchange Lists SHIB</h2>
<p>On Monday, March 25, Bitcoin.com.au <a href="https://x.com/bitcoin_com_au/status/1772124596801556895?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">officially announced</a> the listing of Shiba Inu’s native token, SHIB on its platform. This move comes as part of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-regulation-in-australia-mandatory-licenses/">Australian exchange’</a>s efforts to expand its cryptocurrency offerings and cater to the growing demand for cryptocurrencies among Australian investors.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Bitcoin.com.au is a cryptocurrency exchange that has been operating since 2015, providing crypto trading services to thousands of users in Australia. The exchange’s decision to <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/this-australian-crypto-exchange-lists-lunc-shib-and-ape-coin/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">list Shiba Inu</a> reflects its recognition of the cryptocurrency’s rising popularity and future potential. </p>
<p>Recently, SHIB has been gaining traction, growing rapidly in popularity in different regions globally. The cryptocurrency has also <a href="https://x.com/shibtoken/status/1772327229600440715?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">recorded</a> a position as one of the<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-surge-in-interest/"> top most searched digital currencies on Google</a>, second to Bitcoin in regions like Europe. </p>
<p>Due to the meme coin’s increasing popularity, many exchanges including <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bone-binance-shiba-inu-army-campaigns-for-listing/">Binance</a>, Coinbase, and Bybit have listed it on its platform. Additionally, its <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-takes-over-the-internet-google-searches-climb-as-global-interest-surges/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">growing interest among traders and investors</a> effectively underscores the cryptocurrency’s burgeoning potential and appeal. </p>
<p>In addition to Shiba Inu, Bitcoin.com.au offers a plethora of other cryptocurrency options, including leading digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-outperform-dogecoin/">Dogecoin (DOGE)</a>. </p>
<h2>Shiba Inu Extends Its Reach Into Australian Markets</h2>
<p>Shiba Inu’s official integration into Bitcoin.com.au’s crypto offerings marks a significant achievement, as it provides Australian investors access to the popular doggy-themed meme coin. This development effectively <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-adoption-crypto-atm/">extends the reach of Shiba Inu into the Australian markets</a>, providing solid ground for more growth and development within the ecosystem. </p>
<p>With Australia being home to a surging cryptocurrency community, SHIB is poised to potentially <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-shib-0-0008-ath/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">gain widespread adoption</a> as investors delve into the opportunities available in the cryptocurrency. Additionally, Bitcoin.com.au may benefit from new users as well as Shiba Inu’s large community of investors and supporters. </p>
<p>This listing also comes at a time when Shiba Inu has been experiencing a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-price-soars-10-in-reaction-to-explosive-2367-shib-burn-surge/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">resurgence in prices</a> and investor interest. In the past month, the cryptocurrency has surged by approximately 215.32%, pushing its price up to about $0.00003, at the time of writing. </p>
<p>Despite previous market fluctuations, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-price-resilience-shibarium-reboot/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">SHIB has demonstrated resilience</a> and has continued to capture the attention of investors and traders globally. As the cryptocurrency continues to <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-0-00002-shibarium/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">achieve new milestones</a> in expanding its presence, its listing on Bitcoin.com.au further solidifies its position as a prominent player in the digital asset landscape.</p>

<title>Ethereum Designated As Commodity By CFTC, Triggering Regulatory Conflict With SEC</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-designated-as-commodity-by-cftc/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-designated-as-commodity-by-cftc/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章介绍了美国商品期货交易委员会（CFTC）和证券交易委员会（SEC）之间的纷争，重点是主要加密货币的分类问题。CFTC坚称以太坊（ETH）和其他几种加密货币应被视为大宗商品，与SEC的立场相悖。现在CFTC对KuCoin提起诉讼，指控其非法进行大宗商品期货交易，引发更广泛的数字资产行业争夺。此举与SEC的立场产生矛盾，引发了行业内部的辩论。立法专家提出，CFTC的立场挑战了SEC的权威，暗示监管领域属于两个机构的管辖范围。 <div>
<p>A recent development highlights the ongoing interagency drama between the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC): the classification of major cryptocurrencies has become a focal point of contention. </p>
<p>Once again, the CFTC has affirmed its position that Ethereum (ETH) and several other cryptocurrencies should be classified as commodities, intensifying the battle for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/uk-embraces-crypto-bitcoin-and-ethereum-etns-coming-to-london-stock-exchange/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">regulatory oversight</a> in the expansive digital assets industry.</p>
<h2>Regulatory Rift With SEC Over Bitcoin, Ethereum, And Litecoin Classification</h2>
<p>The latest episode in this regulatory feud unfolded with the CFTC filing a <a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8884-24#:~:text=Washington%2C%20D.C.%20%E2%80%94%20The%20Commodity%20Futures,collectively%20operate%20a%20centralized%20digital" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">complaint </a>against the crypto exchange KuCoin, coinciding with the unsealing of an <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/kucoin-faces-doj-prosecution/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">indictment </a>by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) against KuCoin and its founders, Chun Gan and Ke Tang. </p>
<p>The CFTC&#8217;s complaint alleged that KuCoin engaged in illegal off-exchange commodity futures transactions and leveraged, margined, or financed retail commodity transactions. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the exchange was accused of operating without the necessary registrations, failing to supervise its activities diligently, and neglecting to implement an effective customer identification program.</p>

<p>However, the most <a href="https://x.com/jchervinsky/status/1772666739995595007?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">striking aspect</a> of the complaint lies in the CFTC&#8217;s assertion that KuCoin facilitated trading involving digital assets such as Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Litecoin (LTC), recognizing them as commodities. </p>
<img alt="Ethereum " class="size-large wp-image-290046" height="263" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GJnGoocXIAAvmCv.png?w=645&#038;resize=645%2C263" width="645" />
<p>This starkly contrasts with the SEC&#8217;s current stance, championed by Chair Gary Gensler, which <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-is-a-commodity-sec-chair-crypto-regulation/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">suggests </a>that only Bitcoin holds the commodity classification, leaving other cryptocurrencies outside this designation, including Ethereum.</p>
<p>This ongoing turf war over cryptocurrency classification has a history, as evidenced by the CFTC&#8217;s previous <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-cz-grapple-with-massive-2-7-billion-fine/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">lawsuit </a>against Binance last year, where Ethereum and Litecoin were also deemed commodities. </p>
<h2>Legal Experts Suggest Turf War Over Crypto Jurisdiction</h2>
<p>The discrepancies between the two regulatory bodies have sparked debate within the industry, with legal experts such as Jake Chervinsky, Chief Legal Officer at venture capital firm Variant, interpreting the CFTC&#8217;s position as a challenge to the SEC&#8217;s authority. </p>
<p>Chervinsky <a href="https://x.com/jchervinsky/status/1772668519890444705?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">suggests </a>that the CFTC&#8217;s message to the SEC is that numerous digital assets should be regarded as commodities, indicating that the cryptocurrency space is within the jurisdiction of both agencies, even if the CFTC&#8217;s approach is less vocal. Chervinsky’s statement further reads:</p>
<blockquote><p>Usually, the SEC and CFTC pretend they aren&#8217;t in a turf war over crypto. Today the CFTC is openly attacking the SEC&#8217;s supposed investigation of ETH. This may seem minor, but is actually pretty savage interagency drama by DC standards… I read it as CFTC saying to SEC ~ a ton of other digital assets are commodities too and you&#8217;re not the only one who gets to judge them; this space belongs to us just as much as you, even if we aren&#8217;t as loud about it.</p></blockquote>

<p>As the CFTC and SEC clash intensifies, the industry awaits further developments and official rulings that will shape the regulatory landscape for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/elon-musk-queries-ethereum-founder-buterin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">cryptocurrencies </a>and their respective classifications.</p>
<img alt="Ethereum " class="size-large" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/CqrO7A2m/" width="1815" />
<p>At the time of writing, the price of ETH stands at $3,543, experiencing a slight 0.6% decline in the past 24 hours. This follows a notable 5% rebound over the past seven days.</p>

<title>Dogecoin On-Chain Metrics Explode As Bulls Drive 36% Rally</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-on-chain-metrics-explode/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-on-chain-metrics-explode/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。在文章中，Dogecoin的价格和链上指标均显示出增长趋势。具体来说，交易数量、鲸鱼交易数量和代币年龄消耗这三个指标均有显著增加。此外，虽然Dogecoin面临来自空头的阻力，但仍在50天移动平均线上方保持稳定，并且每日交易量也呈现增加趋势。总体而言，这些指标表明Dogecoin的上涨行情可能刚刚开始。 <div>
<p class="p2"><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-developer-utility-doge/">Dogecoin has been heating up recently</a> and this has been apparent in both its price, as well as its on-chain meme metrics. With investor interest now turning back to the OG meme coin, there has been some marked increase in its on-chain metrics, which suggests that the rally might just be starting.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Dogecoin On-Chain Metrics See Significant Increase</h2>
<p class="p2">Among the Dogecoin on-chain metrics that have seen a significant uptick in recent days, three in particular stand out the most. These include the transaction count, number of whale transactions, and the age consumed of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-outperform-dogecoin/">DOGE</a> tokens.</p>

<p class="p2">Transaction count and whale transactions saw a notable shift as the price began to recover. As <a href="https://insights.santiment.net/read/dogecoin-s-number-of-wallets-with-more-than-0-coins-skyrocketing-with-new-small-addresses-7574" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">data</a> from the on-chain tracking platform Santiment shows, these active transactions rose significantly from 1.22 billion to 9.2 billion in the space of two days. Looking at the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-price-surged-weekend/">DOGE</a> chart, it shows a correlation during this time between the increase in its price and its transaction count.</p>
<p class="p2">Following the same path, the whale transactions, also know as large transactions rallied at this time. These transactions which are carrying DOGE tokens worth $100,000 or more spiked from around 1,500 daily transactions at the start of March to over 4,000 daily transactions toward the end of the month.</p>
<p class="p2">The third metric that has seen an increase during this time is the age consumed. The “Age Consumed” here refers to the amount of time that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-developer-utility-doge/">DOGE</a> tokens are being held by investors. So rather than selling their coins, more Dogecoin investors are choosing to hold onto them in anticipation of more upside.</p>
<p><img alt="Dogecoin" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-290011 aligncenter" height="217" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Dogecoin-Age-Consumed.png?w=640&#038;resize=640%2C217" width="640" /></p>

<h2 class="p2">DOGE Bulls Face Resistance</h2>
<p class="p2">Despite Dogecoin showing considerable strength recently, it continues to face considerable resistance from bears who struggle to pull down the price. The main price point of contention now is $0.2, where the bears have mounted resistance.</p>

<p class="p2">Since hitting this level in early March, Dogecoin has been unable to revisit it, making it the level to beat. Nevertheless, the coin is sitting above its 50-day moving average, which means <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-outperform-dogecoin/">DOGE</a> is skewing toward buy for the short term.</p>
<p class="p2">In addition to its on-chain metrics heating up, the Dogecoin daily trading volume witnessed a 13% increase in the last day, suggesting increased interest. If these metrics continue to rise, it could translate to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-price-surged-weekend/">demand for DOGE and this could trigger a rally above $0.2</a>.</p>
<p class="p2">At the time of writing, Dogecoin is holding steady above $0.18 and maintaining a 36% gain on the 7-day chart.</p>

<title>Tether’s Dark Crown: Most Used Stablecoin In Illicit Crypto Transactions? Reports TRM</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/tether-dark-crown-used-stablecoin-illicit-crypto/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/tether-dark-crown-used-stablecoin-illicit-crypto/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。文章报道了区块链分析公司TRM Labs的研究结果，显示Tether（USDT）在过去一年中被广泛用于非法加密货币交易，尤其是恐怖分子资助活动。尽管整体非法交易量下降，但USDT仍然是最受欢迎的非法稳定币。TRM的分析显示，Tether占2023年非法交易量的193亿美元，较前一年的247亿美元有所减少。 TRM还指出，TRON占45％的非法流量，以及以太坊和比特币分别占24％和18％。 USDC与非法活动联系较少，总额为4.289亿美元。 Tether已经采取行动以应对其稳定币被滥用的问题，并着重于公开区块链的透明性和可追踪性。 <div>
<p>While Tether (USDT), the world’s leading stablecoin, has been pivotal in facilitating transactions across the blockchain space, a recent <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/tether-is-the-most-used-stablecoin-in-illicit-crypto-flows-trm-says-1.2052247" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">analysis</a> by blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs sheds light on a less desirable aspect of USDT&#8217;s ubiquity: its significant use within illicit crypto flows during the past year.</p>
<p>This development unfolds against declining overall volumes of illegal transactions in the crypto sector, a trend attributed to heightened sanctions and regulatory actions against various entities within the ecosystem.</p>

<h2>At the Heart Of Illicit Crypto Transactions?</h2>
<p>According to TRM Labs&#8217; review, Tether accounted for $19.3 billion of the illicit transaction volume in 2023, marking a decrease from $24.7 billion in the preceding year. Despite this reduction, USDT remained the most utilized stablecoin for criminal purposes, including a notable dominance in terrorist financing activities.</p>
<p>TRM’s findings specifically highlight the use of USDT on the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/could-tether-topple-the-crypto-kingdom/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Tron blockchain</a>, which hosts a &#8220;significant portion of Tether&#8217;s total volume,&#8221; as the preferred currency for terrorist financing entities. According to TRM, this blockchain saw a 125% increase in terror-financing-related addresses receiving USDT.</p>
<p>The analysis further breaks down the distribution of illicit flows across major blockchains. Tron was responsible for 45% of these flows, showing an increase from the previous year.</p>
<p>According to the report, the Ethereum and Bitcoin blockchains followed, facilitating 24% and 18% of the illegal transactions.</p>
<p>In comparison, the second-largest stablecoin, USDC, issued by Circle, was linked to a lower volume of illicit activity, totaling $428.9 million.</p>
<p>A Tether spokesperson said to Bloomberg in response to the TRM Labs report:</p>
<blockquote><p>While we don’t have access to the report, historical evidence repeatedly shows that transactional figures have often been exaggerated due to a misinterpretation of data that assumes that if a service receives some small portion of illicit funds then all funds in the service are illicit, significantly inflating the actual values.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notably, this shift in the landscape of illicit crypto transactions coincides with a broader trend of declining illegal fund volumes in the sector, which fell to $34.8 billion in 2023 from $49.5 billion the year before, as highlighted by TRM.</p>
<p>TRM Labs attributes this positive development partly to a &#8220;threefold increase in sanctions&#8221; and regulatory measures targeting &#8220;crypto-related businesses and individuals.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Tether’s Efforts And Regulatory Scrutiny</h2>
<p>Despite TRM&#8217;s claims in the report, Tether&#8217;s stance against the misuse of its stablecoin is worth noting. Last year, Tether collaborated with US authorities and the OKX crypto exchange to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/tether-freezes-225-million-usdt/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">freeze</a> $225 million of its stablecoin linked to a criminal syndicate.</p>
<p>Furthermore, last year, Tether faced criticism, including from the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, which pointed out the popularity of stablecoin <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/tether-usdts-role-in-money-laundering-on-the-rise/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">among money launderers and fraudsters</a>, especially in the context of online gambling platforms.</p>
<p>In response to these criticisms, Tether <a href="https://twitter.com/CriptovalutaI/status/1746862537084215455" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">defended</a> its operations, emphasizing the &#8220;transparency&#8221; and &#8220;traceability&#8221; of transactions on public blockchains, which, according to Tether&#8217;s CEO, Paolo Ardoino, makes USDT an &#8220;impractical choice&#8221; for conducting illicit activities.</p>

<p>The company also <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/tether-say-disappointed-in-the-uns-report-heres-why/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">expressed disappointment</a> over assessments that focus solely on the negative uses of its stablecoin, arguing that such perspectives overlook USDT’s role in supporting<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/tether-launches-recovery-tool-hits-100-billion/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> developing economies</a> in emerging markets.</p>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />维塔利克（Vitalik）赞扬狗狗币网络，并提到他曾向加密慈善机构捐赠SHIB。他的表态对SHIB价格产生了影响，使其在过去24小时内录得一些涨幅。此举显示了狗狗币生态系统的增长，从一个单纯的模因币发展为提供实际用途的加密代币，如通过推出Shibarium来提高交易速度和降低Gas费用。 Vitalik的肯定也突显了狗狗币的发展，为该代币带来了一个重要的认可。 <div>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-scalability-leap-vitalik-buterin-solution/">Ethereum’s co-founder Vitalik Buterin</a> recently heaped some praise on the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-latest-developments-2/">Shiba Inu (SHIB)</a> network following a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-transactions-spree/">transaction</a> that he performed involving the meme coin. His statement immediately impacted SHIB’s price, with the crypto token recording some gains in the last 24 hours. </p>
<h2>Shiba Inu Performs Beyond Expectations</h2>
<p>Vitalik mentioned in an X (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/VitalikButerin/status/1772761661264523563?s=20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> that “SHIB massively outperformed” his expectations. He made this statement while revealing that he had donated SHIB to the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ai-changes-needed-to-save-humanity/">Future of Life Institute (FLI)</a>. The Ethereum co-founder suggested that he had made this donation long beforehand in fear that the transaction would take a while before being processed. </p>
<p>However, that was not the case, as indicated by Vitalik’s praise for Shiba Inu, which means the transaction was processed faster than he expected. Meanwhile, in his tweet, Vitalik alluded to a “crypto relief” situation, and it is worth mentioning that this isn’t the first time that the Ethereum co-founder has made a donation with the meme coin.</p>
<p>In May 2021, Vitalik <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/heres-how-ethereum-founders-1-billion-shiba-inu-covid-aid-donation-is-being-spent/">donated over $1 billion</a> worth of crypto (which included 50 trillion SHIB tokens) to the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereums-vitalik-buterin-donates-600k-for-india-covid-relief-campaign/">crypto campaign relief</a>. That was an Indian COVID relief fund kickstarted by Polygon’s co-founder Sandeep Nailwal to help out with the high number of COVID-19 cases the country was experiencing. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the SHIB tokens that Vitalik donated were <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/heres-how-ethereum-founders-1-billion-shiba-inu-covid-aid-donation-is-being-spent/">reportedly</a> part of the 500 trillion SHIB he had received from the creator of the meme coin. Interestingly, Vitalik <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-founder-burns-billions-worth-of-coins/">burned approximately 420 trillion</a> worth of SHIB coins (almost half of the token’s circulating supply as of then). He explained then that he did this to support the meme coin. </p>
<h2>Evidence Of Shiba Inu’s Growth</h2>
<p>Vitalik’s recent statement about Shiba Inu also exemplifies how the ecosystem has grown since the meme coin <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shib-name-service-launch/">was launched</a> in 2020. SHIB has progressed from being just a meme coin, which was probably just <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-10-largest-meme-coin/">created for fun</a>, to becoming a crypto token that provides real-life utility. Its utility has also become more profound with the launch of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shibarium-public/">layer-2 network Shibarium</a>.</p>

<p>Shibarium was designed to help improve the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-latest-shib-magazine/">Shiba Inu ecosystem</a> by improving transaction speed and lowering gas fees. Therefore, it is not surprising that Vitalik is getting a better feel of Shiba Inu than when he made a transaction with the meme coin in 2021. His statement is a testament to this fact and could serve as a much-needed endorsement going forward.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at around $0.00003055, up over 3% in the last 24 hours according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/shiba-inu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">data</a> from CoinMarketCap. </p>

<title>Is KuCoin The Next FTX? CryptoQuant’s CEO Has The Answer</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/kucoin-the-next-ftx-cryptoquant-ceo/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/kucoin-the-next-ftx-cryptoquant-ceo/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。美国司法部对全球加密货币交易所KuCoin及其两位创始人提起刑事指控，指控其涉嫌合谋经营无牌照的货币传输业务以及违反《银行保密法》。然而，CryptoQuant首席执行官Ki Young Ju表示，从链上的角度看，KuCoin的比特币和以太坊储备看起来并未受到影响。Ju还强调了KuCoin与FTX的储备管理实践之间的明显区别，指出KuCoin的BTC和ETH储备看起来是有机的，而FTX则存在资金管理问题。目前，KuCoin持有价值476.4亿美元的多链组合资产。 <div>
<p>On Tuesday, the US Department of Justice announced criminal charges against the global crypto exchange KuCoin and two of its founders, Chun Gan (also known as &#8220;Michael&#8221;) and Ke Tang (also known as &#8220;Eric&#8221;). The charges, related to conspiring to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business and violations of the Bank Secrecy Act, have stirred concerns among users and investors about the future of the Seychelles-based exchange, echoing fears reminiscent of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-collapse-alameda-usdt/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">FTX collapse</a>.</p>
<h2>Is KuCoin The Next FTX?</h2>
<p>According to the official <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/prominent-global-cryptocurrency-exchange-kucoin-and-two-its-founders-criminally" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a> by the Southern District of New York, the indictment accuses KuCoin and its founders of deliberately failing to implement an adequate <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-checkout-com-cuts-ties-citing-aml-concerns/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">anti-money laundering (AML) program</a>. This negligence allegedly facilitated the use of the platform for money laundering and terrorist financing activities.</p>
<p>Moreover, the exchange is accused of not maintaining necessary procedures to verify customer identities and failing to report any suspicious activities.</p>

<p>Despite these serious allegations, CryptoQuant CEO Ki Young Ju <a href="https://twitter.com/ki_young_ju/status/1772820598198313298" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">provided</a> a contrasting view, focusing on the exchange&#8217;s operational and financial stability. Through a statement on X, Ju highlighted that, from an on-chain perspective, KuCoin&#8217;s Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) reserves seem unaffected by the surge in withdrawals, primarily by retail users.</p>
<p>Ju remarked, &#8220;On-chain wise, Kucoin is fine. BTC and ETH withdrawals surged, driven mainly by retail users, with a small impact on the overall reserve. They appear to not <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-collapse-sam-bankman-fried-trial/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">commingle customers&#8217; funds</a> and have sufficient reserves to process user withdrawals.”</p>

<p>This reassurance comes at a crucial time when the memory of FTX&#8217;s downfall, triggered by liquidity issues and allegations of misusing customer funds, still lingers in the minds of the crypto community. Ju made a clear distinction between the reserve management practices of KuCoin and FTX, underscoring the organic nature of KuCoin&#8217;s BTC and ETH reserves in contrast to the problematic handling of funds by FTX.</p>
<p>“Kucoin&#8217;s BTC and ETH reserves appear organic, unlike those of FTX. They don&#8217;t commingle customers&#8217; funds,” Ju stated and shared the Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange reserves charts by CryptoQuant.</p>
<img alt="KuCoin exchange reserves" class="size-full wp-image-290018" height="459" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GJpS3LSbAAApII8.jpg?resize=1024%2C459" width="1024" />
<p>Ju contrasted these charts with the one’s from FTX, noting “Here are FTX reserves for comparison. FTX commingled customers&#8217; funds with their funds; you can see a lot of bulk deposits/withdrawals in the charts. It doesn&#8217;t look organic.”</p>
<img alt="FTX exchange reserves " class="size-full wp-image-290017" height="524" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GJpSgYJbMAAsM5i.jpg?resize=1024%2C524" width="1024" />
<p>As of now, KuCoin hold 5.949 BTC and 99.358 ETH, according to CryptoQuant’s data. The total balance of KuCoin&#8217;s portfolio across multiple chains is valued at $4.764 billion, according to Scopescan <a href="https://scan.0xscope.com/report/kucoin?network=eth&amp;pp=KRinweb3" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">data</a>.</p>
<p>At press time, the KuCoin token (KCS) traded at $11.42, down -20% since the news broke.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Whales Go On $7 Billion Shopping Spree, New ATH Soon?</title>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。 在过去的一周内，比特币鲸鱼大笔购买超过100,000 BTC，显示出对该货币价值可能是利好的迹象。这些鲸鱼持有的比特币数量已经达到了类似之前分发开始前的水平，这可能会推动比特币价格继续走高。目前，比特币价格大约在71,000美元左右，过去七天上涨超过11%。 <div>
<p>On-chain data shows the Bitcoin whales have gone on a huge buying spree in the past week, a sign that could be bullish for the coin&#8217;s value.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Whales Have Scooped Up More Than 100,000 BTC Recently</h2>
<p>As pointed out by analyst Ali in a <a href="https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1772878274193961468/photo/1" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, the BTC whales have purchased more than 100,000 BTC over the last week. The indicator of relevance here is the &#8220;<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-non-whale-addresses-41-1-all-time-high/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Supply Distribution</a>&#8221; metric from the on-chain analytics firm Santiment.</p>
<p>This indicator tells us about the total amount of Bitcoin that the different wallet groups in the market are holding right now. The addresses are divided into these cohorts based on the total number of coins that they are carrying in their balance.</p>

<p>The 1-10 coins group, for instance, includes all wallets holding at least 1 and at most 10 BTC. In the context of the current discussion, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/big-money-eyes-dogecoin-whale-activity-explodes-600/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">whale</a> cohort is the one of interest. These humongous entities are typically defined as investors owning between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC.</p>
<p>The chart below shows how the &#8216;Supply Distribution&#8217; for the Bitcoin whales has changed over the past few months:</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Supply Distribution" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="1470" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GJqHABIX0AAn6CC?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096" width="2864" /></p>

<p>As displayed in the above graph, the total amount of Bitcoin supply held by the 1,000-10,000 BTC group has registered a significant jump over the past week or so.</p>
<p>During this buying spree, the BTC whales have added more than 100,000 BTC to their holdings, worth upwards of $7 billion at the current exchange rate of the cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>This latest accumulation from the whales started when BTC was trading around its recent lows, so it&#8217;s possible that these large investors believed those prices to be low enough to be profitable entry points, which is why they bought big at them.</p>
<p>As this buying has occurred, BTC&#8217;s bullish momentum has reignited, with its price now surging back above the $70,000 level. Given the close timing, it would appear that the whale accumulation was in part a driver for the rally.</p>
<p>Between the start of the year and the end of February, these humongous holders had been continuously buying more of the asset, with their holdings riding on an uptrend.</p>
<p>As the rally progressed further, though, these investors started falling for the allure of profit-taking as they had shifted towards a trend of net distribution instead.</p>

<p>With the recent buying, however, not only has the trend of net distribution reversed, but the supply of the whales has in fact also returned back to levels similar to the ones seen before the distribution had first begun.</p>
<p>If the Bitcoin whales can keep up this buying in the coming days, then the latest rally may be able to continue further, just like how it was earlier in the year.</p>
<p>Naturally, a continuation from here would mean the possibility of a brand new <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-breaks-through-69000-setting-new-record/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">all-time high</a>, as BTC currently isn&#8217;t far from setting one.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin is floating around the $71,000 mark, up more than 11% in the last seven days.</p>

<title>BREAKING: Coinbase Vs SEC Case Reaches Critical Point, Full Details Revealed</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/breaking-coinbase-sec-case-reaches-critical-point/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/breaking-coinbase-sec-case-reaches-critical-point/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章介绍了法院对Coinbase与美国证券交易委员会（SEC）之间的法律纠纷的裁决。法院支持了SEC的主张，称Coinbase在交易所、经纪商和清算机构方面存在违规行为，但在钱包问题上支持了Coinbase。裁决意味着案件将继续进行，这对于行业相关的法律纠纷具有重要意义。法院否定了Coinbase的动议，裁定SEC的指控成立，并认为Coinbase的母公司可能会因为对其进行管理和指导而受到控制。最后，法院要求双方在2024年4月19日之前提交提案管理计划。 <div>
<p>In a highly anticipated judgment with significant implications for the crypto industry&#8217;s legal battles against regulators in the United States, the court overseeing the Coinbase and US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) legal battle has delivered a ruling. </p>
<p>The court found against the crypto firm, supporting the SEC&#8217;s claims that the platform operated as an exchange, broker, and clearing agency. However, the court also sided with the US-based exchange on certain SEC claims regarding its wallet. As a result, the case will proceed, marking a pivotal moment in the ongoing dispute.</p>

<h2>Court Denies Coinbase&#8217;s Motion</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://plum-harrietta-82.tiiny.site/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">court&#8217;s decision</a> stemmed from the SEC&#8217;s allegations that Coinbase facilitated transactions in crypto-asset securities without proper registration, violating Sections 5, 15(a), and 17A(b) of the Exchange Act. </p>
<p>The SEC contended that Coinbase acted as a marketplace, bringing together buyers and sellers of &#8220;crypto-asset securities&#8221;, while also serving as a custodian of securities through its wallet system. In this regard, the court denied the exchange&#8217;s motion to dismiss Counts I, II, and III of the complaint, affirming the SEC&#8217;s claims.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the court found that Coinbase&#8217;s parent company, CGI, could be held liable as a control person of Coinbase under Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act. It determined that CGI exercised power and control over the crypto firm, managing and directing its operations, thus denying Coinbase&#8217;s motion to dismiss Count IV.</p>
<h2>Mixed Ruling</h2>
<p>Regarding the exchange&#8217;s Staking Program, the court agreed with the SEC&#8217;s argument that it constituted an investment contract under the Howey Test, making it subject to registration under the Securities Act. According to the ruling, the program allowed customers to stake various crypto assets, and the court found that Coinbase&#8217;s managerial efforts provided financial returns, meeting the definition of an investment contract. </p>
<p>As a result, the court concluded that the SEC adequately alleged the exchange&#8217;s unregistered offer and sale of securities, denying Coinbase&#8217;s motion for judgment on the pleadings.</p>
<p>However, the court granted Coinbase&#8217;s motion concerning the SEC&#8217;s claims concerning its Wallet application. While the SEC alleged that the crypto firm conducted brokerage activity through Wallet, the court found the factual allegations insufficient to support the inference that the exchange acted as an unregistered broker.</p>
<p>Finally, both parties are directed to submit a proposed case management plan by the court on or before April 19, 2024. </p>
<p>Commenting on the potential implications of this outcome, Edward Snowden <a href="https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/1772991885067395339" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">wrote</a> the following on his X account:</p>
<blockquote><p>This doesn&#8217;t bother me. If the SEC keeps acting in bad faith like this, they&#8217;re going to lose so hard in court that they&#8217;ll never be able to do this to anyone ever again. Remember when the SEC got spanked so badly that Gensler had to approve BTC ETFs with tears in his eyes? yeah</p></blockquote>

<title>Finance Guru Reveals Why Bitcoin Is The ‘Perfect Asset At The Right Time’</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/finance-guru-bitcoin-perfect/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/finance-guru-bitcoin-perfect/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。本文介绍了畅销书《富爸爸穷爸爸》作者对比特币的赞美和推崇。文章探讨了比特币作为完美资产的特质，包括与传统货币的比较以及对美国政府的批评。作者认为比特币是在当前经济和金融环境中最佳的资产选择，鼓励人们投资于实际资产如比特币、黄金和白银。他对比特币未来的价值保持乐观，并预测其可能在未来几年内触及100,000美元。 <div>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-among-hottest-subjects/">Robert Kiyosaki</a>, the best-selling author of the popular book, ‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’ has hailed <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/vaneck-ceo-declares-bitcoin-unbeatable/">Bitcoin as the perfect asset</a>. Delving into the digital asset’s distinctive qualities, the financial expert offers a comprehensive comparison between BTC and <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/the-us-dollar-is-dying-buy-bitcoin-prominent-financial-educator/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">traditional fiat currencies</a> through a question-and-answer format. </p>
<h2>Bitcoin As The Perfect Asset</h2>
<p>In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, Kiyosaki <a href="https://x.com/therealkiyosaki/status/1772474875397185846?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">posed</a> a series of questions about Bitcoin, accompanied by answers to each query. When he questioned <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/buy-much-bitcoin-as-you-can/">his stance on BTC</a>, the finance guru unequivocally declared himself a Bitcoin bull, affirming his admiration for the cryptocurrency. </p>

<p>He characterized Bitcoin as the “perfect asset at the right time,” because of its high value and potential in today’s economic and financial landscape. </p>
<p>According to the financial author, BTC could be a scam or a Ponzi Scheme. However, the same could be said about most of the traditional fiat currencies in the world such as the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/author-rich-dad-recommends-gold-bitcoin-as-dollar-is-dying/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">United States Dollar (USD)</a>, Euro, Yen and others. </p>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/robert-kiyosaki-champions-crypto/">Kiyosaki has branded fiat currencies</a> as “fake,” shedding light on the inconsistencies in the US government’s efforts to stimulate economic and financial growth. The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/robert-kiyosaki-avocates-bitcoin-investment/">finance expert criticized US political leaders</a>, denouncing them as “incompetent or corrupt or both,” while outlining the economic challenges such as debt and inflation faced by the US. </p>
<p>Despite his <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/buy-more-bitcoin-kiyosaki-says/">pessimistic assessment of fiat currencies</a>, Kiyosaki has remained optimistic about Bitcoin. The financial guru has heralded <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-network-strengthens-hashrate-all-time-high/">Bitcoin as a strong network</a>, highlighting that he was super bullish on the cryptocurrency because it applied Metcalf’s law, which states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of its user base. In other words, as more people use Bitcoin, its overall value increases. </p>
<h2>Kiyosaki’s Advice To The Crypto Community</h2>
<p>In his post, Kiyosaki advises the broader crypto community against investing their funds in the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/economist-us-dollar-bitcoin/">US dollar</a>, urging them instead to <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/best-decision-is-to-buy-bitcoin-btc-robert-kiyosaki-urges/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">save in more valuable and tangible assets</a> like silver, gold and Bitcoin. He emphasized that individuals who saved in “fake money” were at a disadvantage, highlighting the risks associated with investing in a currency vulnerable to inflationary pressures.</p>

<p>Further stressing his views on BTC, Kiyosaki acknowledged the possibility of the cryptocurrency’s future value diminishing to zero. However, he noted that fiat currencies could face a similar risk, highlighting the historical depreciation of thousands of fiat currencies to zero. </p>
<p>As a result, the financial guru has encouraged investors to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/robert-kiyosaki-safeguard-your-wealth-with-bitcoin/">safeguard their funds</a> by investing in real-world assets like Bitcoin. He has predicted the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/kiyosaki-set-to-buy-10-more-bitcoin-before-april/">price of Bitcoin to soar to $100,000</a> within six months, anticipating the cryptocurrency to potentially rise to this value by September 2024. This forecast underscores the financial author’s bullish outlook on Bitcoin and his unwavering <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/r-kiyosaki-reiterates-bitcoin-potential-amid-greatest-crash-warning/">endorsement of the cryptocurrency’s potential</a>.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Ripe For A Rally? Exchange Liquidity Fast Dropping</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-ripe-rally-exchange-liquidity-fast-dropping/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-ripe-rally-exchange-liquidity-fast-dropping/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章指出，尽管比特币目前呈现横向走势和微弱弱势，但链上数据表明比特币可能在未来几天内会出现反弹。该反弹将由几个因素驱动，包括交易所流动性减少和机构需求增加。比特币流动存货比率正在下降，显示出可交易的BTC数量比历史水平低。此外，美国市场对现货比特币交易所交易基金的需求增加，这可能导致比特币供应不足，从而推动价格攀升。最后，交易所流动性下降与2024年4月中旬的比特币减半事件重合，这可能为BTC价格的进一步上涨提供支撑。 <div>
<p>Despite the current sideways movement and flashes of weakness, on-chain data suggests that Bitcoin might rally in the days ahead. The upswing for the world&#8217;s most valuable coin will be driven by several factors, including dwindling exchange liquidity and rising institutional demand.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Liquid Inventory Ratio Is Falling</h2>
<p>In a <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/ki_young_ju/status/1772873355130999119" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Ki Young Ju, founder of the popular cryptocurrency analysis platform CryptoQuant, shared data indicating that the Bitcoin Liquid Inventory Ratio has hit an all-time low. This ratio considers Bitcoin holdings across all major exchanges and the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). It measures the amount of BTC readily available for trading across leading exchanges. </p>
<img alt="Bitcoin inventory across exchanges and GBTC | Source: Ki Young Ju on X" class="size-full wp-image-290003" height="714" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GJp9Lz-b0AAkRci.jpg?resize=1024%2C714" width="1024" />
<p>When this ratio drops, it often signals a crucial shift in the Bitcoin market. For one, it shows that the supply of Bitcoin available for purchase on exchanges is much lower than historical levels. Therefore, considering the current demand, the resulting imbalance can trigger price volatility since buyers now have to compete for a limited pool of available BTC.</p>

<p>Historically, periods of low exchange liquidity for Bitcoin have often coincided with price surges. With fewer coins readily available, each buy order tends to increase prices.</p>
<h2>The Rise of Spot Bitcoin ETFs</h2>
<p>While the Bitcoin Liquid Inventory Ratio falls, there is growing demand for spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the United States. The derivative product allows the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/fidelity-adjusts-ethereum-etf-application/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">issuer</a> to mint shares and sell them on bourses to institutions and even retailers. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulates this product. </p>
<p>A given amount in BTC goes back to each share. This means that the number of shares minted is directly proportional to the Bitcoin the issuer can acquire. If supply drops, prices must rise to match demand.</p>
<p>Because spot Bitcoin ETF holders are relieved of the hassle of securing the private keys of coins, investors, particularly institutions, might choose to hold Bitcoin through these ETFs instead of keeping it on exchanges. This would further reduce the readily available supply of Bitcoin for trading.</p>
<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/x/0NYoUnFJ/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Bitcoin price trending upward on the daily chart | Source: BTCUSDT on Binance, TradingView" class="size-full" height="904" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/0NYoUnFJ/" width="1787" /></a>
<p>If the current high demand for Bitcoin persists, coupled with withdrawals from exchanges to non-custodial wallets and a potential shift to spot Bitcoin ETFs, a supply crisis could be brewing. </p>

<p>Notably, exchange liquidity appears to be falling ahead of the Bitcoin halving event in mid-April 2024. Coupled with the optimism that prices will likely, it is highly likely that BTC prices might find support, erupting to new levels in the sessions ahead. </p>

<title>Will Hong Kong’s Bitcoin ETFs Outshine US Peers? Experts Weigh In</title>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。香港证监会计划在第二季度推出基于比特币的ETF，可能成为全球比特币ETF市场的领导者。此举可能引发资金流向变化，尤其在亚洲市场。与美国只允许现金交易不同，香港允许实物交易，这可能带来更高的资产管理规模和交易量。虽然存在一些挑战，如中国市场无法获得这些ETF，但香港ETF的成功可能会超出预期。BTC目前交易价格为70158美元。 <div>
<p>Hong Kong is on the verge of a groundbreaking move in the Bitcoin space. According to a recent Bloomberg Intelligence <a href="https://t.co/IxcdWEFDvC" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) is <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/spot-bitcoin-etf-chinese-fund-giant-hong-kong/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">expected to approve</a> spot Bitcoin ETFs with in-kind creations and redemptions in the upcoming second quarter. This development could significantly alter the landscape of crypto investments, potentially positioning Hong Kong as a leader in the global Bitcoin ETF market.</p>
<p>Noelle Acheson, a prominent voice in the crypto industry and author of the “Crypto is Macro Now” newsletter, weighed in on the potential implications of this move. &#8220;The Asian crypto market is much larger than the US crypto market in terms of volume,” Acheson stated.</p>
<p>She elaborated on two possibilities: the existing high volume might indicate that the market is already saturated, or it could suggest a deeper familiarity and comfort with crypto assets in Asia. &#8220;Listed ETFs in Hong Kong could channel a significant amount of money into &#8216;approved&#8217; portfolio allocation,” Acheson added, hinting at the potential for a major shift in investment flows.</p>

<p>Adding to the discussion, Eric Balchunas, a Bloomberg ETF expert, <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1772602019133423921" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">underscored</a> the significance of Hong Kong&#8217;s approach to allowing<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-turn-spot-bitcoin-etf-cash-redemption/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> in-kind creations</a> and redemptions for spot Bitcoin ETFs—a stark contrast to the US, which only allows cash creations. &#8220;This could help spark AUM and volume in the fast-growing region,&#8221; Balchunas commented, pointing out the strategic advantage Hong Kong might gain.</p>
<p>Caitlin Long, the founder and CEO of Custodia Bank, <a href="https://twitter.com/i/bookmarks?post_id=1772802183014097103" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">highlighted</a> another key aspect of Hong Kong&#8217;s proposed ETF structure: the ability to withdraw Bitcoin directly, which ensures that investors are not just holding &#8220;paper bitcoins.&#8221; Long expressed her excitement about this development, stating, &#8220;If this is true (need confirmation), it’d be HUGE indeed — and it’d be ironic, given that Hong Kong, not the US, would be doing it. Meanwhile, US banks would watch from the sidelines as they’re left in the dust…”</p>
<h2>Will Hong Kong’s Bitcoin ETFs Be Bigger Than Its US Peers?</h2>
<p>The conversation around the potential of Hong Kong&#8217;s Bitcoin ETFs extended beyond industry experts to the wider crypto community. Bitcoin Munger, a renowned analyst on X, <a href="https://twitter.com/bitcoinmunger/status/1772604152520036428" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">argued</a> that the Hong Kong ETFs could serve as a far more bullish catalyst than those in the US.</p>

<p>Citing data from Glassnode showing a year-over-year supply change of Bitcoin moving from West to East, he suggested that this trend strengthens the case for Hong Kong&#8217;s ETFs outshining their US counterparts. “Coins have been moving from West to East. Makes a strong case that the Hong Kong ETFs are going to be a far more bullish catalyst than the US ETFs,” he remarked.</p>
<img alt="Bitcoin regional year-over-year supply change" class="size-full wp-image-289926" height="576" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GJRhA3QW4AAoBqw.jpg?resize=1024%2C576" width="1024" />
<p>However, not everyone is convinced of the disproportionate impact of Hong Kong&#8217;s ETFs. In a spirited exchange, Eric Balchunas cautioned against overestimating Hong Kong&#8217;s market size relative to the US. “Let’s not get crazy now. HK tiny vs US,” Balchunas replied.</p>
<p>Bitcoin Munger retorted by suggesting that the success of Hong Kong&#8217;s ETFs might not be fully appreciated yet, and any positive surprises could leave analysts, including Balchunas, taken aback.</p>
<p>When a user raised a pertinent question about the accessibility of these ETFs to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/chinas-crypto-investors-earn-1b-in-profits/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Mainland Chinese investors</a>, Balchunas responded negatively, “No not available.” This dampens some enthusiasm, as the significant Chinese market, amidst a real estate crisis and an inclination towards gold, might have been a strong supporter of Bitcoin through these ETFs.</p>
<p>At press time, BTC traded at $70,158.</p>
<img alt="Bitcoin price" class="size-full wp-image-289993" height="472" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BTCUSD_2024-03-27_12-28-24.png?resize=1024%2C472" width="1024" />

<title>Ripple CTO Responds To Dev’s Decision To End XRP Contribution</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-cto-responds-to-dev-nulls-disconnection/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章讨论了Ripple Labs首席技术官David “JoelKatz” Schwartz对New Dev Null Productions停止对XRP及其生态系统的贡献的看法。Dev Null Productions决定终止对XRP生态系统的贡献，指责Ripple的领导层出售XRP损害零售投资者利益。Schwartz表示即使有持有XRP的愿望，卖出这种数字货币几乎是不可避免的。他还谈到了XRP分配的挑战以及社区成员提出的关于采取其他行动的建议。文章还提到Dev Null Productions多年来为XRP生态系统提供的重要支持和贡献。Schwartz解释了分配XRP时面临的困难和无法解决这个问题的情况。 <div>
<p>Ripple Labs Chief Technology Officer (CTO) David &#8220;JoelKatz&#8221; Schwartz has <a href="https://x.com/JoelKatz/status/1772755924228415745?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">weighed</a> in on New Dev Null Productions&#8217; choice to cease its contribution towards XRP and its ecosystem, offering perspective on the development.</p>
<h2>Ripple CTO Advocates For XRP</h2>
<p>On Tuesday, Dev Null Productions <a href="https://devnullprod.com/article/adieu-xrp" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> its decision to discontinue its contribution to XRP and its ecosystem, which the company dubbed &#8220;The end of an era,&#8221; triggering speculations within the community.</p>

<p>The company stated that one of its reasons for cutting ties with the payment firm boils down to faith or rather the absence of it. Additionally, the decision of Ripple&#8217;s top leadership to sell its XRP at the cost of retail investors served as the major driver for the firm&#8217;s action.</p>
<p>Dev Null believes that by taking this step, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/march-26-pivotal-for-ripple-xrp/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ripple</a> has demonstrated that the people in charge do not have enough faith in XRP to give up short-term financial benefits that come at the expense of the hardworking community. </p>
<p>Even though the leaders talk well in front of cameras or an audience, Dev Null believes they still lack transparency and accountability to the people they owe their success to, noting that actions speak louder than words.</p>
<p>Responding to the firm&#8217;s claims, Schwartz stated that even if you wish to hold XRP, selling the coin is almost impossible to avoid. David Schwarts then drew attention to a previous post regarding the tax implications involved in obtaining XRP from the company.</p>
<p>Offering an instance, Schwarts noted that if Ripple awarded him a bonus of 1 million <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-price-face-melting-rally/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">XRP</a> tomorrow, he would be forced to sell roughly half of it right away. This is because he has a marginal tax rate of nearly 50% on earned income from both Federal (Fed) and California (CA) states. </p>
<p>Without a doubt, Dev Null Productions has been a significant contributor to the XRP ecosystem, supporting several events and developments within the ecosystem. In the past six years, the company has been a sole supporter of the NYC/XRP meetup, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-swell-xrp-product-rebrand-new-partners/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ripple Swell event</a>, Ripple Drop Interview, Rippled source code, Xrpintel &#8211; the first independent XRP data and analytics projects, San Francisco Blockchain Week, and among others.</p>
<h2>Difficulty In Distribution The Crypto Asset</h2>
<p>Addressing the concerns about XRP&#8217;s distribution, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-cto-breaks-down-the-amm-feature/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ripple CTO</a> claims the process is somewhat challenging. According to Schwartz, there is a common complaint among community members that the distribution is too concentrated, followed by complaints that there is too much distribution. Thus, this tends to remain this way as there is nothing more that can be done, and there are no available options.</p>

<p>However, the community seems to disagree with Schwartz as a member offered an option saying the company should purchase something else that moves and makes money.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the event that we take no action with our XRP, the distribution stays concentrated,&#8221; Schwarts <a href="https://x.com/JoelKatz/status/1772762338246213692?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">responded</a>, since the concentration of XRP with Ripple is a common and valid complaint within the community.</p>

<title>Morgan Stanley Set To Approve Bitcoin ETFs In The Next 2 Weeks: Insider</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/morgan-stanley-bitcoin-etfs-2-weeks-insider/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章首先提到，据报导，摩根士丹利将在接下来的两周内批准比特币ETF。这一新闻由加密评论家Andrew通过X平台首次披露。Eric Balchunas也表达了乐观态度。此外，摩根士丹利计划在其经纪业务中引入现货比特币ETF产品。最近，美国市场上有10个现货比特币ETF，其中财新和富达的FBTC资产领先。这一举措显示了现货比特币ETF与传统金融服务的日益融合。BTC当前的交易价格为70,594美元。 <div>
<p>The Bitcoin space is on the verge of a monumental shift, with insider reports emerging that Morgan Stanley, a titan in the financial sector, is poised to approve Bitcoin ETFs on its platform within the next two weeks. This groundbreaking news was first brought to light by renowned crypto commentator Andrew from Arch Public (@AP_Abacus) via X (formerly Twitter).</p>
<p>According to Andrew, &#8220;UPDATE: several sources confirming that Morgan Stanley is set to approve Bitcoin ETF&#8217;s on their platform in the next two weeks. Sources are from inside MS, inside BTC ETF firms, and legal insiders adjacent to both. Morgan Stanley holds more than $1.5T in client assets.&#8221; This statement has stirred considerable interest and speculation across the financial and BTC communities.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Eric Balchunas, a Bloomberg ETF expert, in response to Andrew&#8217;s tweet, showcased a blend of optimism and skepticism by stating, &#8220;Feels right, not doubting you, but what&#8217;s the source?&#8221; Andrew, maintaining the confidentiality of his informants, replied succinctly with &#8220;DM,&#8221; indicating a private message discussion for further details.</p>
<h2>Will Morgan Stanley Offer Bitcoin ETFs To Its Clients?</h2>
<p>This revelation is not entirely unexpected, as rumors about Morgan Stanley&#8217;s interest in BTC ETFs have been circulating since late February. Reports suggest that the financial behemoth has been engaged in due diligence processes to incorporate spot Bitcoin ETF products into its brokerage offerings. This information came from individuals familiar with the matter.</p>

<p>Morgan Stanley, a vanguard in alternative investments and private markets, boasting over $150 billion in assets under management, made headlines in 2021 as the first major US bank to provide its affluent clientele with access to BTC funds. During its first-quarter earnings call in April 2021, the wealth management giant confirmed its move to expose its wealth management clients to Bitcoin through two external crypto funds. These funds, understood to have been offered by <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/galaxy-digital-delays-ethereum-etf-launch-to-may-how-will-this-impact-eth-price-in-feb-2024/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Galaxy Digital</a> and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-spot-etf-nydig-predicts-30-billion-demand/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">NYDIG</a>, marked the bank&#8217;s initial foray into Bitcoin.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/breaking-spot-bitcoin-etfs-approved-by-us-sec/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">introduction of spot BTC ETFs</a> in the United States, approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January, represented a watershed moment for the industry. Despite billions of dollars already being channelled into these products, their full potential is anticipated to be unleashed once they become available through major Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) networks and broker-dealer platforms, including those affiliated with prominent firms like Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo.</p>

<p>Since yesterday, the US market hosts 10 spot bitcoin ETFs, with <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-gobbles-up-nearly-196000-btc/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">BlackRock&#8217;s IBIT</a> and Fidelity&#8217;s FBTC leading in assets. The exact ETFs Morgan Stanley intends to offer remain unspecified, though the firm&#8217;s history suggests a strategic selection process favoring both innovation and client interest.</p>
<p>Morgan Stanley&#8217;s forthcoming decision to approve Bitcoin ETFs underscores the increasing integration of spot Bitcoin ETFs within traditional financial services. This move, if confirmed, could significantly influence the market, further fueling inflows into these ETFs.</p>
<p>At press time, BTC traded at $70,594.</p>

<title>Betting Against Bitcoin? Short Sellers Stake $11 Billion Against Crypto-Linked Stock Rise</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-short-sellers-bet-against-crypto-stock/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-short-sellers-bet-against-crypto-stock/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。虽然加密货币市场出现看涨的势头，比特币价格显着上涨，但空头卖方持怀疑态度，押注加密货币相关股票会下跌。空头利润减少60亿美元，但他们并未放弃，继续加大对该领域的空头仓位。这可能导致加密货币相关股票出现空头挤压的风险，使短空头不得不购买股票以退出，推高价格。此外，加密货币市场也受到巨额平仓影响，涵盖了潜在的风险和挤压。 <div>
<p>Despite the bullish momentum witnessed in the cryptocurrency market, fueled by a significant uptick in Bitcoin&#8217;s price, skepticism among short sellers <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/short-sellers-bet-11-billion-that-crypto-stock-rally-won-t-last-1.2051859" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">persists</a>, and billions of dollars have been wagered on the downturn of cryptocurrency-linked <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-reaches-trillion-dollar-valuation-how-it-stacks-up-to-stocks-gold-more/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">stocks</a>.</p>
<p>For context, Short sellers are investors who speculate that a stock&#8217;s or other asset&#8217;s price will decline. They borrow shares of the asset from a broker and sell them on the open market at the current price.</p>
<p>They aim to buy back the same number of shares later at a lower price, return the borrowed shares to the broker, and pocket the difference as profit.</p>

<h2>Betting Against Bitcoin? The Short Selling Surge</h2>
<p>According to Bloomberg, citing a recent report from S3 Partners LLC, the short interest in the cryptocurrency-linked stock sector has escalated to approximately $11 billion this year, indicating a substantial bet against the sustainability of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-correlation-dollar-index-stocks-disappeared/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">current rally</a>.</p>
<p>Notably, most of this short interest targets MicroStrategy Inc. and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/paradigm-industry-titans-rallying-behind-coinbase/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Coinbase Global Inc.</a>, accounting for over 80% of the total bets against the crypto sector.</p>
<img alt="Bet against crypto-linked stock sorted by highest." height="349" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bnnbloomberg.ca/polopoly_fs/1.2051860.1711472050!/fileimage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.png?resize=620%2C349&#038;ssl=1" width="620" />
<p>This contrarian stance has resulted in paper losses nearing $6 billion for short sellers, as Bitcoin&#8217;s year-to-date gain of over 150% buoyed cryptocurrency-linked stocks. Despite these losses, short sellers appear undeterred, intensifying their positions against the sector.</p>
<p>According to Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3, the increase in short selling is a strategy some investors employ to either anticipate a &#8220;pullback&#8221; in Bitcoin&#8217;s rally or hedge against direct <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-mining-stocks-bitcoin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin investments</a>.</p>
<h2>Risks And Potential Squeezes</h2>
<p>The persistence of short sellers in targeting crypto-linked stocks poses risks, particularly if the market does not align with their bearish forecasts. Several stocks within this sector, including <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/microstrategy-1-of-all-bitcoin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">MicroStrategy</a>, Coinbase, and Cleanspark Inc., are identified as susceptible to short squeezes, according to Bloomberg, citing S3.</p>
<p>This phenomenon occurs when short sellers are compelled to purchase stocks to exit their losing positions, inadvertently driving prices up and exerting additional pressure on other short sellers.</p>
<p>So far this year, MicroStrategy&#8217;s stock has surged by roughly 167%, while Coinbase and Cleanspark have experienced gains of 58.60% and 85.16%, respectively, highlighting the potential for significant short squeezes.</p>
<p>Amid these market dynamics, the broader cryptocurrency sector has also seen substantial liquidations. Data from Coinglass indicates that over $190 million worth of positions have been liquidated in the last 24 hours alone.</p>
<img alt="Crypto market liquidations heatmap." class="wp-image-289806 size-large" height="532" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-26-at-18.34.59.png?resize=980%2C532" width="980" />
<p>Most of these liquidations were long positions, accounting for approximately 61.45%. Binance traders bore the brunt of these liquidations, experiencing losses of $81.33 million, surpassing the liquidations on OKX, which amounted to $70 million.</p>

<p>This period of liquidations coincides with a slight retracement in Bitcoin&#8217;s price from its 24-hour high above $71,000 to a current trading price of $69,879 at the time of writing.</p>

<title>Battle Over ‘Sam Coins’: FTX Customers Demand Millions From Bankrupt Crypto Firm</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/battle-over-sam-coins-ftx-customers-demand-millions/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/battle-over-sam-coins-ftx-customers-demand-millions/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是负面的。FTX客户要求对Sam Coins进行更高估值，与涉及创始人Sam Bankman-Fried的欺诈活动有关。客户要求数亿美元的赔偿，与FTX进行法律决战。FTX声称其他客户将获得全额赔偿。文章还提到了与Sam Bankman-Fried有关的三种数字代币的交易趋势。 <div>
<p>FTX customers are demanding substantial payouts from the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-set-to-cash-in-884-million-from-sale-anthropic/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">bankrupt crypto firm</a>. These customers claim three digital tokens, known as &#8220;Sam Coins,&#8221; deserve a higher value despite their association with convicted co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried.</p>
<h2>Investors Push For Higher Valuation</h2>
<p>According to a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-26/ftx-crypto-creditors-fight-claim-that-sam-coins-are-worthless?sref=2jPYL79S" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, the investors holding tokens called Serum, MAPS, and OXY are urging US Bankruptcy Judge John Dorsey to override the company&#8217;s experts&#8217; conclusion that the tokens are “nearly worthless.” </p>
<p>Notably,<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-50-years/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> Sam Bankman-Fried</a>, who created Serum and obtained control over the other two tokens, was involved in securing deals related to them, as mentioned in court documents.</p>

<p>When FTX filed for bankruptcy in November 2022, the company held a significant majority of the tokens, far exceeding what could be sold, even without considering the fraudulent activities that led to its collapse, as the company argued in a court filing.</p>
<p>The firm’s advisers have proposed that the tokens should be valued at a minimal amount, possibly just a few cents. However, the token holders argue that this estimate is “flawed” and have presented their <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-bankruptcy-trade-turns-into-legal-showdown/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">valuation method</a> in court, suggesting that the tokens are worth hundreds of millions of dollars. They have filed claims demanding payment based on their calculations.</p>
<h2>FTX Customers Prepare For Legal Showdown</h2>
<p>FTX&#8217;s lawyers state that other former customers will likely receive full reimbursement for their investments on the trading platform before bankruptcy. These customers had invested in US dollars, Bitcoin (BTC), and other assets that still hold value today. </p>
<p>The case between the customers and FTX is scheduled to reach its final arguments on Tuesday before Judge Dorsey in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware.</p>
<p>Per the report, the &#8220;Sam Coins&#8221; played a significant role in this fraudulent scheme, as asserted by bankruptcy officials. While these tokens had distinct names, they were colloquially called &#8220;Sam Coins&#8221; due to their close association with Bankman-Fried.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Sam Bankman-Fried was <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftxs-sam-bankman-fried-should-receive-50-year-jail/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">convicted </a>of fraud for improperly transferring customer assets to a hedge fund under his control. The funds were subsequently utilized for high-risk investments, political donations, and expensive real estate, ultimately leading to the collapse of the FTX empire.</p>
<img alt="FTX" class="size-large" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/DCRLaVvO/" width="1815" />
<p>At present, the native token of the exchange, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-drops-bombshell-lawsuit/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">FTT</a>, is trading at $2.15, reflecting a 3% decline in price over the past 24 hours. However, the token has witnessed significant gains in recent months, accumulating a total growth of 65%.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the three coins associated with Bankman-Fried display varying trends. Serum (SRM) has experienced a decline of over 5% in the past 24 hours and is currently valued at $0.06318. </p>
<p>On the other hand, MAPS is trading at $0.03549, demonstrating an upward trend of 9.4% during the same time frame. Lastly, Oxygen (OXY) stands at $0.01629, showcasing a notable surge of 15% within the given period.</p>

<title>Russian Crypto Firms Face Sanctions By US Treasury For “Supporting Evasion”</title>

<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/russian-crypto-firms-face-sanctions-by-us-treasury-for-supporting-evasion/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。美国财政部对与俄罗斯有关的加密公司实施了新一轮制裁，以打击OFAC指定实体通过虚拟资产服务规避制裁。共有13家实体和2名个人被指控协助交易和提供加密服务，帮助规避制裁。其中，Bitpapa和Netex24被分析研究公司Chainalysis列入制裁名单，帮助规避制裁实体。这两家公司的交易历史显示，它们与被制裁实体和暗网市场有着重要联系，转移了数百万美元的加密货币。对这些通过加密服务绕过制裁的实体加强打击，是美国政府持续努力的一部分。 <div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced a new round of sanctions on crypto-related companies linked to Russia. The measure is part of the US government’s efforts to combat OFAC-designated entities from evading sanctions through virtual asset services.</p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">OFAC Designates Russia-Linked Crypto Companies</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The US treasury has recently <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2204" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">designated</a> thirteen entities and two individuals for allegedly facilitating transactions and offering crypto services to help “evade sanctions.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The new designations target companies servicing Russia’s core financial infrastructure for operating in the “financial services and technology sectors of the Russian Federation economy.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The list includes Russia-based and Russia-linked individuals developing and offering virtual asset services that &#8220;enable the evasion of US sanctions by OFAC-designated entities.&#8221;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The move bans all transactions and interactions between the designated entities and US individuals. It is part of OFAC and the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/g7-to-create-strategy-for-crypto/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">G7’s efforts</a> against the evasion of sanctions and export control measures from the designated parties.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Brian E. Nelson, Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Russia is increasingly turning to alternative payment mechanisms to circumvent U.S. sanctions and continue to fund its war against Ukraine. As the Kremlin seeks to leverage entities in the financial technology space, Treasury will continue to expose and disrupt the companies that seek to help sanctioned Russian financial institutions reconnect to the global financial system.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">On-Chain Data Unveils Bitpapa And Netex24 Assistance In Sanctions Evasion</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchain research firm Chainalysis <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/ofac-sanctions-russia-blockchain-companies-netex24-bitpapa/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">released</a> a report analyzing two of the newly OFAC-designated entities: Netex24, a Moscow-based fintech company that operates as a crypto exchange, and Bitpapa, a peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange that facilitates payments for Russian crypto businesses on OFAC’s list.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">According to the report, both companies have facilitated significant transactions to sanction entities over the past two years.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The company identified “clusters associated with both services using on-chain data.” The report highlights that exchanges without Know Your Customer (KYC) controls and darknet markets make up a significant portion of the companies’ transaction history.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">These transactions include Russian-language sites offering “on and off ramping with sanctioned Russian banks.” The two companies have registered massive fund outflows sent for seemingly illegal purposes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="crypto, Russia sanctions " class="size-large wp-image-289814 aligncenter" height="538" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/cumulative-value-800x538-1.png?w=800&#038;resize=800%2C538" width="800" /></p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">According to Chainalysis, Bitpapa registered 52% of outflows to Sanctioned entities and 32.6% to darknet markets from October 2019 until March 2024. Meanwhile, Netex24 exhibits 46.7% of outflows to darknet markets and 23.4% to sanctioned entities from October 2016 until March 2024.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The cumulative value sent from these companies to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-sanctions-imposed-by-these-3-countries/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">sanctioned</a> parties increased since 2022, when Russia’s war in Ukraine started. As the chart above shows, the darknet market transactions increased alongside those of sanctioned entities during this timeframe, rising above $75 million since the second half of 2023.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Per the report, both entities transferred millions of dollars worth of crypto to Hydra Market and crypto exchange Garantex. Additionally, the companies facilitated transactions for several pro-Russia militia and propaganda groups, including OFAC-designated MOO Veche.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The US government has intensified its efforts against entities bypassing sanctions through crypto-related services. A round of sanctions was imposed in January on the platforms involved in the facilitation of crypto transactions linked to the terrorist group Hamas as part of the ongoing efforts for</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, The US has severely targeted <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/coinbase-treasury-letter-opposing-crypto-regulation/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">crypto mixers</a> for the misuse of these privacy tools by criminal actors, including bans on Tornado Cash and its founder, which has raised concerns in the crypto community.</p>

<title>Ethereum Spot ETF On Thin Ice? Expert Predicts 25% Approval Odds Amid SEC Silence</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-spot-etf-expert-predicts-approval-odds/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-spot-etf-expert-predicts-approval-odds/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。美国证券交易委员会（SEC）正在审批以太坊现货交易所交易基金（ETF），但Bloomberg的ETF高级分析师Eric Balchunas认为，以太坊现货ETF获得批准的可能性仅为25％。SEC对以太坊的分类和监管态度令人担忧，最近对加密公司发出“传票”，引发了对将以太坊归类为证券的猜测。在这种监管不确定性下，以太坊的市场表现尽管不错，但以太坊现货ETF的未来仍存疑。 <div>
<p>The discussion surrounding approving a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is intensifying as the decision announcement date rapidly approaches.</p>
<p>Bloomberg&#8217;s Senior ETF Analyst, Eric Balchunas, has <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1772372601098162624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">shared</a> a rather cautious outlook, estimating the likelihood of an ETH spot ETF receiving the green light at a mere 25%.</p>

<h2>Ethereum Slight Chance To A Spot ETF Approval</h2>
<p>Skepticism about the unlikelihood of a spot ETH ETF approval is rooted in what Balchunas perceives as deliberate non-engagement from the SEC rather than mere procrastination, leading to an absence of positive indicators for approval in the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/uk-embraces-crypto-bitcoin-and-ethereum-etns-coming-to-london-stock-exchange/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">current environment</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Re Eth ETF approval, we are holding the line at 25% odds altho tbh it is a very pessimistic 25%. The lack of engagement seems to be purposeful vs procrastination. No positive signs/intel anywhere you look. Personally hope they do approve it but it just ain&#8217;t looking good. <a href="https://t.co/nuBdCDE18L" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://t.co/nuBdCDE18L</a></p>
<p>— Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1772372601098162624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">March 25, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The debate over the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sec-delays-decision-on-grayscales-ethereum-etf-here/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">SEC&#8217;s stance</a> on a potential Ethereum spot ETF is nuanced, with opinions divided within the industry. On the one hand, Balchunas has expressed disappointment over the lack of encouraging signs for Ethereum spot ETF approval despite holding out hope for a positive outcome.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Craig Salm, Grayscale&#8217;s Chief Legal Officer, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-spot-etf-mirrors-bitcoins-strength/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">offers a different perspective</a>, suggesting that the SEC&#8217;s silence should not be<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/elon-musk-queries-ethereum-founder-buterin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> interpreted negatively</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">2/ In the final months leading up to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#Bitcoin</a> ETF approval, <a href="https://twitter.com/Grayscale?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">@Grayscale</a> and others received positive and constructive engagement from the SEC. We had thoughtful conversations and discussed the finer details of creation/redemption procedures, cash v. in-kind, APs, LPs, custody etc.</p>
<p>— Craig Salm (@CraigSalm) <a href="https://twitter.com/CraigSalm/status/1772360838793384389?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">March 25, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Salm argues that many operational details relevant to an Ethereum spot ETF have already been addressed during the approval process for the spot Bitcoin ETF, implying that fewer aspects might require engagement this time around.</p>
<h2>Ethereum&#8217;s Market Performance Amid Regulatory Uncertainty</h2>
<p>Despite <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-ceo-predicts-sec-setback-in-ethereum-case/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">varying opinions</a> on the implications of the SEC&#8217;s current engagement levels, the agency&#8217;s actions indicate a cautious approach toward Ethereum and its classification.</p>
<p>Recent moves by the SEC, including <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/03/20/sec-gary-gensler-ethereum-security-commodity-crypto-foundation/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">issuing</a> &#8220;subpoenas&#8221; to crypto firms about their interactions with the Ethereum Foundation, have fueled speculation about a campaign to classify Ethereum as a security.</p>
<p>This development, coupled with the regulatory body&#8217;s historical hesitance towards cryptocurrency ETFs, casts doubt on the immediate future of a spot ETH ETF.</p>

<p>Amid this regulatory uncertainty, ETH&#8217;s market performance has been noteworthy. In the past week alone, the cryptocurrency has seen a 10% increase in value, with its price trading above $3,500 at the time of writing.</p>

<title>SEC Faces Lawsuit Over Crypto Airdrops, Defendants Push For Non-Security Status</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/sec-lawsuit-over-crypto-airdrops-defendants-push/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/sec-lawsuit-over-crypto-airdrops-defendants-push/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的<br />美国证券交易委员会（SEC）面临一场新的诉讼，挑战监管机构未能清晰为加密行业提供分类，特别是关于将加密空投分类为证券的失败。起诉书由DeFi教育基金（DEF）和总部位于德克萨斯州的服装公司Beba Collection提起，旨在促使法院裁定BEBA代币不属于投资契约类别。起诉书主要关注SEC对BEBA代币的处理以及违反行政程序法的行为。DEF和Beba认为，该案的结果将对加密行业产生重大影响，为行业提供重要的清晰度。 <div>
<p>The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is facing a new lawsuit that aims to challenge the regulator&#8217;s failure to provide a clear <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sec-commissioner-crypto-regulation-enforcement/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">regulatory framework</a> for the crypto industry, specifically regarding classifying crypto airdrops as securities. </p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed by the DeFi Education Fund (DEF) and Beba Collection, an apparel company based in Texas, seeks to prompt the court to rule that the BEBA token does not fall under the category of a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/turkey-nears-completion-crypto-regulation-framework/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">securities </a>investment contract.</p>
<h2>Lawsuit Targets SEC&#8217;s Treatment Of BEBA Token</h2>
<p>In their <a href="https://x.com/fund_defi/status/1772277649227878560?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>, the DeFi Education Fund expressed concerns over the SEC&#8217;s “aggressive enforcement actions,” which they believe pose an existential threat to the crypto industry. The lawsuit focuses on two claims. </p>
<p>First, Beba Collection requests a declaratory judgment stating that BEBA tokens are not investment contracts and that the free airdrop of BEBA tokens for marketing purposes does not constitute a securities transaction. </p>

<p>Second, the DeFi Education Fund and Beba argue that the SEC violated the Administrative Procedure Act by adopting a policy that treats nearly all crypto assets as investment contracts and digital asset transactions as securities transactions.</p>
<p>Regarding crypto airdrops, Beba Collection asserts that the free distribution of BEBA tokens does not involve an &#8220;investment of money,&#8221; a key requirement under the Howey test for determining <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/peirce-slams-secs-move-to-target-crypto-auditors/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">investment contracts</a>. According to Beba, no investment contract exists since the tokens were given away without monetary investment from recipients.</p>
<h2>Crypto Industry Strikes Back</h2>
<p>The second claim focuses on the SEC&#8217;s compliance with the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which requires agencies to adopt <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/brazil-to-introduce-tougher-crypto-regulation/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">new rules</a> openly and with public input. </p>
<p>DEF and Beba argue that the SEC implemented a radical new policy under Chairman Gensler&#8217;s leadership without providing the required opportunity for public comment. The DeFi Education Fund further alleged:</p>
<blockquote><p>Instead, the SEC ramped up its enforcement actions, hired more people to make them happen, and created a “who’s next?” fear in the industry. The natural outcome of the SEC’s actions is: “cross your fingers and hope the SEC does not come knocking on your door.” We can’t allow this state of play to continue.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, DEF suggested that the outcome of this case could have significant implications. A ruling in favor of DEF and Beba that the SEC&#8217;s approach to crypto violates the APA would be a major obstacle to the SEC&#8217;s ongoing “regulatory overreach.” </p>
<p>Additionally, if the court determines that BEBA tokens are not investment contracts and that free <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/mark-cuban-takes-jab-at-sec/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">airdrops </a>are not securities transactions, it would provide much-needed clarity to the industry.</p>

<p>As the lawsuit unfolds, the crypto community and industry stakeholders eagerly await the court&#8217;s decision, hoping for a favorable outcome that promotes innovation, fosters regulatory clarity, and curtails excessive enforcement actions by the SEC.</p>

<title>Pro-XRP Lawyer Sees 40% Settlement Odds For Ripple-SEC After Ruling</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/pro-xrp-lawyer-ripple-sec-settlement-odds-40/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/pro-xrp-lawyer-ripple-sec-settlement-odds-40/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。文章讨论了SEC对瑞波实验室提出的2亿美元罚款的请求，并解释了SEC如何指控瑞波公司在XRP销售中的不当行为。文章还分析了一位支持XRP的律师对SEC文件的评论，强调了对瑞波公司的影响以及可能的结局。律师认为SEC的动作可能导致两种结果：一种是对瑞波有利的和解，另一种是进入第二轮的上诉。 最后，XRP的实时交易价格为0.63美元。 <div>
<p>In an escalation of the ongoing legal battle between Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the regulatory agency has advanced its position by <a href="https://twitter.com/FilanLaw/status/1772466842524582296" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">filing</a> a Motion for Remedies and Entry of Final Judgment, which notably includes a request for a $2 billion penalty against Ripple.</p>
<p>Fred Rispoli, a pro-XRP lawyer and founder of HODL Law, has provided a detailed <a href="https://twitter.com/freddyriz/status/1772441439823077550" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">analysis</a> of the SEC’s motion through a series of comments on X (formerly Twitter). Rispoli’s breakdown offers an insider perspective on the potential outcomes and strategies at play.</p>
<p>He noted, &#8220;#XRPcommunity The SEC&#8217;s motion for judgment has been publicly filed. TLDR: SEC is following the playbook I outlined two months ago,&#8221; reflecting on the predictability of the SEC&#8217;s actions but also underscoring the gravity of the situation for Ripple.</p>
<h2>SEC Puts Ripple In Trouble</h2>
<p>Rispoli’s analysis highlights several key points from the SEC&#8217;s filing, with particular emphasis on the claim that Ripple offered significant discounts on XRP sales to certain <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sec-victory-ripple-disclosure-financial-statements/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">institutional buyers</a>. The SEC argues that there were two groups of institutional sales investors while Ripple offered one group significant discounts in XRP price over the other group that did not receive them.</p>
<p>This practice, according to the SEC, not only skewed some institutional sales investors but also potentially disadvantaged retail investors. The lawyer credited the agency for this tactical move.</p>

<p>“It realized that it needs to show how investors were actually harmed. Ripple has already said the SEC&#8217;s motion is full of mischaracterizations. Let&#8217;s hope that is correct because the picture painted is not a good look for Ripple and lends credence to the XRP haters on why the price is so low. Namely, the deep discounts by Ripple on XRP sales,” Rispoli stated.</p>
<p>At the same time, he expressed concerns over these revelation, stating, &#8220;If discounts are wide enough, then Institutional Buyers (like GSR) scored unbelievable discounts and have bags-upon-bags of XRP that they could continually sell at astronomical profit,&#8221; pointing to a potential imbalance in the investment landscape fostered by Ripple’s actions.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Rispoli shed light on the SEC&#8217;s portrayal of Ripple’s business practices, notably the company&#8217;s continuation of XRP sales as its primary revenue source, even after legal scrutiny intensified. He elaborates, &#8220;SEC claims the financial discovery it received by court order demonstrates this is by far and away Ripple&#8217;s primary source of revenue,&#8221; suggesting a critical view of Ripple&#8217;s dependency on these sales amidst ongoing litigation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the document also reveals that Ripple is still signing contracts with institutional buyers. Since the start of the XRP lawsuit in December 2020, the company has signed 80 contracts.</p>
<h2>Pro-XRP Lawyer Predicts Two Possible Outcomes</h2>
<p>The classification of Ripple&#8217;s<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-clo-clarifies-xrp-is-not-used-liquidity-hub/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> On-Demand Liquidity (ODL)</a> transactions represents another crucial aspect of Rispoli’s analysis. The legal determination of whether these transactions constitute unlawful sales or are permissible under law is a significant factor that could influence Ripple&#8217;s operational latitude.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stakes are very high here,&#8221; Rispoli asserts, adding, “we have to hope Ripple has sufficiently changed its business practices to account for Torres&#8217; ruling.”</p>
<p>The potential consequences of the SEC’s motion are profound, with Rispoli speculating on the likelihood of a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-vs-sec-lawsuit-may-result-in-settlement/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">settlement</a>. He assessed, &#8220;This motion is of enormous consequence,” with two options on how this ends:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>One, the amount ordered by the court is low enough and rulings on newly-structured sales favorable enough (to Ripple) that there is a final settlement after the ruling. I&#8217;m now putting this at 40% odds. More likely is this will come out favorable to Ripple on the amount of money owed but that Ripple takes hits on what is allowed going forward, meaning this is going to an appeal to the 2nd.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>At press time, XRP traded at $0.63.</p>

<title>Shiba Inu On The Rise: Here Are The Latest Developments Driving Bullish Sentiment</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-latest-developments-2/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-latest-developments-2/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。Shiba Inu（SHIB）生态系统的发展趋势积极，长期持有者数量增加，市场表现乐观。SHIB的销毁计划和Shibarium的创新也为进一步增长奠定基础。此外，市场营销努力也取得成功，吸引了更多用户参与生态系统，推动了活跃用户数量的增加。当前SHIB价格为0.00002914美元。 <div>
<p>Several <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inus-shibarium-hits-new-record-amid-chaotic-market-movements/">developments and happenings</a> in the Shiba Inu (SHIB) ecosystem continue to highlight the crypto token’s growth. These fundamentals also hint at <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-surge-crypto-shib/#:~:text=Shiba%20Inu%20To%20See%20A%20300%25%20Gain%20Before%20Year%2Dend&amp;text=Looking%20at%20SHIB&#039;s%20chart%2C%20the,invest%20in%20the%20crypto%20token.">SHIB’s price</a> being primed for further <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-dogecoin-shib-excitement/">moves to the upside</a>. </p>
<h2>The SHIB Army Is Resilient</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-0-001-9-25-trillion-shib/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Shiba Inu team member Ragnar</a> drew the community’s attention to the rise in the number of SHIB’s long-term holders in less than a year despite the meme coin’s tepid price movement at some point. Data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock showed that the number of addresses holding $10 million worth of SHIB has grown from 57 to 209 since June 2023. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, there has also been an uptick in the number of addresses holding $1 million worth of SHIB, with 1319 addresses falling under this category. This information underscores the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-team-discloses-projects-true-strength/#:~:text=The%20Shiba%20Inu%20team%20unveiled,commonly%20referred%20to%20as%20ShibArmy.">SHIB community’s faith</a> in the meme coin and how they have continued to remain bullish even when there wasn’t enough reason to do so. </p>
<p>In another X (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/RagnarShiba/status/1772380489627713731?s=20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, Ragnar highlighted how Shiba Inu’s burning program and innovations to Shibarium are setting SHIB up for further growth. So far, SHIB Burns, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-shib-burns/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">a community initiative</a>, has continued to positively impact the meme coin’s price whenever it is carried out. </p>
<p>These <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-burns-bright-shib/">token burns</a> have also increased with the help of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shibarium-public/">layer-2 network Shibarium</a>, with the team committing to converting some of the network fees to SHIB and burning them. Meanwhile, with the advancements in Shibarium, network activity is expected to pick up again, which would ultimately lead to more SHIB tokens being burnt. </p>
<h2>Shiba Inu Marketing Has Also Helped</h2>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-latest-shib-magazine/">The Shiba Inu team</a> has also chosen not to rest on its laurels. They have continued to actively develop strategies to onboard new users into the ecosystem and maintain the bullish sentiment in the community. <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shib-2024/">Shiba Inu’s Marketing Lead, Lucie</a>, has led the way in this regard, actively promoting meme coin trading on Shibarium for some time now. </p>

<p>The reason for this isn’t farfetched, as the meme coin frenzy on networks like <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-network-forces-binance-to-halt-withdrawals/">Solana</a> and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/coinbase-base-opens-doors-featuring-100-dapps/">Base</a> has attracted more users and caused network activity to skyrocket. As such, the team is no doubt looking to lure some meme coin investors to the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shibarium-99-decline/">Shibarium network</a> in hopes that this will help the ecosystem gain more traction. </p>
<p>Their efforts already seem to be paying off, as their promotion of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inus-shibarium-hits-new-record-amid-chaotic-market-movements/">‘DAMN’ meme coin</a> has led to a rise in the number of daily active users on WoofSwap, a decentralized exchange (DEX) on Shibarium. </p>
<p>At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at around $0.00002914, up over 5% in the last 24 hours according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/shiba-inu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">data</a> from CoinMarketCap. </p>

<p>As pointed out by Litecoin Foundation Director of Marketing Jay Milla in a <a href="https://twitter.com/MillaLiraj/status/1772326693400887383" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, the total number of LTC addresses with a balance has grown recently.</p>

<p>Below is a chart using data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock that shows how the total number of LTC addresses carrying a non-zero balance has changed since the start of the year:</p>
<p><img alt="Litecoin Addresses" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="956" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GJiRVtEaQAAdpQS?format=jpg&amp;name=large" width="1737" /></p>

<p>From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that the total number of LTC holders has been going up this year, with the metric recently managing to surpass the 8 million mark, a new milestone for the blockchain.</p>
<p>Uptrends in the indicator can arise from a few different things. The first and most obvious one is fresh <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-adoption-explodes-20x-shib-dethrone-doge/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">adoption</a>; brand new users coming into the network would naturally open up new addresses and add coins to them, thus raising the total holder count.</p>
<p>Another factor that may contribute to a rise in the metric is existing users opening up new addresses for themselves to divide their holdings, perhaps for a purpose like privacy.</p>
<p>Investors who had left the cryptocurrency earlier, making a return to the network, would also register as a rise in the indicator. In general, all of these factors may be in play at the same time, but the important fact is that a net amount of adoption is usually occurring when the metric goes up.</p>
<p>For any cryptocurrency network, adoption is a constructive sign, as it means that the coin is able to attract fresh attention to it. It, however, usually doesn&#8217;t impact the asset in the short-term.</p>
<p>According to Jay, the total number of Litecoin addresses with a balance has increased by more than 1 million within the past year alone, which would imply that the asset&#8217;s adoption has accelerated in this period.</p>
<p>Historically, the main attraction of the LTC blockchain has been the fact that it offers fast transactions at a cheap rate. It would appear that this quality is still driving interest behind the asset, but unfortunately for its investors, the growth hasn&#8217;t quite reflected in its price, as LTC has lagged behind its peers.</p>

<p>One upcoming development that may be positive for Litecoin, though, is the fact that on the first date of the coming month, the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase plans to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-coinbase-futures-listing/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">launch a futures product</a> for LTC.</p>
<h2>LTC Price</h2>
<p>Litecoin has been putting together some upward momentum recently, as its price has now crossed back above the $91 mark. The below chart shows how the asset has performed during the past few days.</p>
<p><img alt="Litecoin Price Chart" class="alignnone size-medium aligncenter" height="854" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/nDTNjrpu/" width="1534" /></p>

<p>While the LTC price is up 13% over the past week, these profits have still been weaker than its competitors, which is why the coin is currently only the 22nd largest in the sector based on <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/total-crypto-market-cap-to-hit-7-5-trillion-next-year/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">market cap</a>.</p>

<title>Shiba Inu Snags Silver: Memecoin Is Europe’s 2nd Most Beloved Crypto</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要: 这些信息是积极的。Shiba Inu (SHIB)作为领先的狗主题加密货币之一，引起了全球投资者的关注，成为欧洲搜索量第二高的加密货币。SHIB价格的快速上涨和对其前景的乐观预期吸引了投资者的关注，尤其是在欧洲。SHIB的全球社区强大且积极活跃，帮助其在竞争激烈的加密货币市场中脱颖而出。虽然与其他狗主题加密货币存在激烈竞争，但SHIB社区自信地宣称自己是加密货币世界的“头号狗”，展示了其竞争实力。 <div>
<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB), the leading canine-themed cryptocurrency, has captured the attention of investors worldwide, emerging as the second most searched cryptocurrency in Europe.</p>
<p>Surpassing established contenders like Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), and even its predecessor Dogecoin (DOGE), SHIB&#8217;s meteoric rise in popularity signals a significant shift in the cryptocurrency landscape.</p>

<p>The surge in interest comes on the heels of an impressive rally in SHIB&#8217;s price, with the token witnessing a staggering 300% increase over eight days in early March. Investors, both seasoned and new, found themselves captivated by SHIB&#8217;s impressive performance, reminiscent of its glory days in 2021.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-289685" height="59" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_093314.png?resize=933%2C59" width="933" /></p>

<p>The price of the memecoin has been rising over the last 24 hours, and it has made a failed attempt to break above the $0.3 resistance level. Even with this setback, the SHIB price&#8217;s tenacious development trajectory and durability point to the possibility of a positive breakout if the $0.00003 barrier is forcefully crossed.</p>
<h2><strong>Shiba Inu Bags No. 2 Spot As Second Most-Adored Crypto</strong></h2>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><img alt="🤯" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f92f.png" style="height: 1em;" /><img alt="🤯" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f92f.png" style="height: 1em;" /> SHIB is the 2nd most searched crypto in Europe only behind Bitcoin. The <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SHIBARMY?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">#SHIBARMY</a>&#8216;s unstoppable growth is only just beginning.

<p></p>
<p>Europe, in particular, has emerged as a hotbed of enthusiasm for SHIB, with data revealing that it ranks only behind Bitcoin (BTC) as the most searched cryptocurrency in the region. Seven European countries, including Italy, Russia, and France, witnessed a skyrocketing surge in online searches for SHIB, outpacing other major cryptocurrencies in the region.</p>
<h2><strong>Shiba Inu: Global Community Strength</strong></h2>
<p>Beyond Europe, SHIB&#8217;s appeal has transcended borders, with increased Google searches observed in countries such as Pakistan, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Canada, and Nigeria. This global interest underscores SHIB&#8217;s status as a truly international phenomenon, captivating the attention of investors across continents.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/Q2QvDzt2/" width="1835" /></p>

<p>One of the key factors driving SHIB&#8217;s popularity is its vibrant and dedicated community, as evidenced by its recent ranking as the number one meme-based cryptocurrency with the strongest community.</p>
<p>A poll conducted by WazirX revealed that SHIB garnered 48% of the total votes, outperforming rivals like Dogecoin, Floki Inu, Pepe, and Bonk. The SHIB community&#8217;s unwavering support and engagement have solidified its position as a force to be reckoned with in the cryptocurrency world.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-289691" height="399" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_338635.png?resize=1024%2C399" width="1024" /></p>


<p>However, amidst the euphoria surrounding SHIB&#8217;s ascent, it&#8217;s essential to acknowledge the competitive landscape within the cryptocurrency market. The rivalry between SHIB and other dog-themed cryptocurrencies, notably Dogecoin and Floki Inu, remains palpable.</p>
<p>The SHIB community&#8217;s confident assertion of being the &#8220;top dog&#8221; in the crypto world is a subtle nod to its competitors, highlighting the spirited competition that defines this niche market segment.</p>

<title>Dogecoin Developer Lauds New Use Case That Will Bring Added Utility For DOGE Users</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-developer-utility-doge/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-developer-utility-doge/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章首先介绍了开发人员提出的有关Dogecoin的全球用例的最新讨论，旨在提高其效用和功能性。开发人员指出，Dogecoin可以通过新的用例赋予无银行服务的人更多权力，例如使用RadioDoge建立金融自由。此外，文章强调了Dogecoin在改善全球金融安全和推动广泛采用方面的潜力，通过提供实际利益和解决方案来增强其效用。 <div>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-coinbase-futures-listing/">Dogecoin</a> has once again grabbed the attention of the broader crypto community, as a developer announces a groundbreaking new use case, aiming to boost utility and offer enhanced functionality for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-5-million-doge-holders/">DOGE users</a> globally.  </p>
<h2>Dogecoin To Empower The Unbanked</h2>
<p>In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-is-unresponsive-and-sick-developer/">Timothy Stebbing</a>, a developer for Dogecoin Foundation, <a href="https://x.com/tjstebbing/status/1772376076318335066?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">unveiled</a> an innovative new use case for Dogecoin, highlighting the impact <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-bullish-signal-doge/">DOGE transactions</a> could have in regions struggling to access traditional banking systems. </p>

<p>According to Stebbing, Dogecoin’s new use case is seen in its evolving role as an instrument for self-empowerment, emphasizing its ability to equip individuals with the necessary resources to improve their circumstances. He revealed that through this approach, “real utility is built for Dogecoin.”</p>
<p>Delving deeper into DOGE&#8217;s newly discovered use case, Stebbing highlighted a previous <a href="https://x.com/tjstebbing/status/1767840909130105342?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">discussion</a> he had in 2023 regarding RadioDoge, a decentralized communication and data transmission network. In his post, the developer described RadioDoge as a “means of bringing financial freedom to the unbanked.”</p>
<p>Recapping the discussion from last year, Stebbing unveiled multiple use cases for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-adoption-explodes-as-890000-new-addresses-are-added/">Dogecoin</a>, stressing the cryptocurrency’s potential to address the banking challenges faced by the underserved population. He revealed that by utilizing RadioDoge, individuals in small towns and villages lacking access to traditional banking systems can <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/x-dogecoin-payments-included/">use DOGE as a means of payment. </a></p>
<p>Additionally, given Dogecoin’s ability to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-usage-explodes-doge-processing-million-day/">provide more affordable and swifter transactions</a>, it could serve as a viable alternative for individuals who rely on banking systems like Western Union to transfer funds to family members abroad.  </p>
<p>In light of these advantages, Stebbing shared that he would be meeting with a member of an organization specializing in building self-managing saving plans for villages. The focal point of the meeting will revolve around exploring the potential impact of RadioDoge in regions where <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cfos-weigh-in-on-the-efficiency-costs-and-user-benefits-of-decentralized-finance-and-traditional-banking/">conventional banking infrastructure</a> remains elusive. </p>
<h2>Enhancing Utility To Create Widespread Adoption</h2>
<p>It’s well known that the utility of a cryptocurrency plays a vital role in its long-term value and adoption. And, according to Stebbing, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/wordpress-websites-can-now-accept-dogecoin-payments/">Dogecoin’s utility</a> focuses on providing support and solutions to populations without access to specific financial resources. </p>

<p>By <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/russia-approves-bitcoin-for-cross-border-payments/">facilitating cross-border transactions</a> and improving the financial security of individuals globally, Dogecoin stands as a cryptocurrency committed to enhancing the utility of its users through real-world applications. Stebbing has revealed that through added utility, Dogecoin stands to potentially <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-adoption-accelerates-fastest-doge-comeback/">gain widespread adoption</a>. </p>
<p>This is because cryptocurrencies that offer tangible benefits and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/6-cryptos-with-real-world-utility-and-growth-potential/">address real-world needs</a> often gain traction quickly among users. This rapid adoption subsequently <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-adoption-1100-price/">boosts the value</a> of the cryptocurrency. </p>

<title>Scoring A Win: Mastercard Endorses Ripple For Global Remittances – A Boost For XRP?</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/mastercard-endorses-ripple-for-global-remittances/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/mastercard-endorses-ripple-for-global-remittances/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要: 这些信息是积极的。在Mastercard最近的报告中，该公司承认了Ripple在拉丁美洲汇款领域的重要性，指出了传统汇款服务面临的挑战，并认可了Ripple的区块链技术作为潜在解决方案。报告还指出了Ripple在改变国际转账方式方面的潜力，以及预测了数字汇款市场的巨大增长。最终，Ripple在Mastercard报告中的认可导致其XRP价格出现显着上涨。 <div>
<p>Financial services giant Mastercard has given a significant nod to Ripple, a crypto-focused company, in a recent report exploring the future of remittances in Latin America. The report highlights the challenges of traditional remittance services and recognizes Ripple&#8217;s blockchain technology as a potential solution.</p>

<h2><strong>Ripple Gets Stamp Of Approval From Mastercard</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/media/ltfpfln3/pcmi_mastercard_the_future_of_remittances_en_march2024.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">The Mastercard report</a> highlighted the critical role remittances play in Latin America. Citing UN data, it details how these cross-border payments are a lifeline for families and communities, especially in low and middle-income countries. Mexico, for instance, received a staggering $55 billion in remittances in 2022, making it the world&#8217;s largest recipient.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-289720" height="826" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_8ac19e.png?resize=811%2C826" width="811" /></p>
<h2><strong>Remittance Services Struggle With High Fees And Security Risks</strong></h2>
<p>However, the article identifies several pain points plaguing remittance services. High fees, heavy reliance on cash transactions, security concerns, and a lack of user-friendly digital experiences are major hurdles for users. These inefficiencies not only make sending and receiving money cumbersome but also eat into the already strained finances of many.</p>
<p>This is where Ripple steps in. The Mastercard report acknowledges Ripple, alongside Stellar and Circle, as pioneers in leveraging blockchain technology to revolutionize international money transfers. Blockchain&#8217;s core attributes, such as transparency and immutability, offer the potential for faster, more secure, and cost-effective remittance services.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ripple?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">#Ripple</a> cited a few times in the new MasterCard report, &#8220;The future of remittances in Latin America: Digitalization, multiple rails, &amp; the strategic role of partnerships&#8221; as an example of blockchain in remittances &amp; CBDCs. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/XRP?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">#XRP</a> not directly mentioned.
1/3<a href="https://t.co/6Wj2xOh73b" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://t.co/6Wj2xOh73b</a></p>
<p>— WrathofKahneman (@WKahneman) <a href="https://twitter.com/WKahneman/status/1772366065919558098?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">March 25, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>The report further shines a light on Ripple&#8217;s partner, SBI Remit. This Japanese money transfer service provider began using Ripple&#8217;s XRP cryptocurrency for cross-border transactions in three Asian countries last year. This development underscores the real-world application of Ripple&#8217;s technology in facilitating smoother and potentially cheaper remittances.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/CzS7AThO/" width="2475" /></p>

<p>Beyond remittances, Mastercard acknowledges Ripple&#8217;s work with island nation Palau in exploring central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). CBDCs are digital versions of a country&#8217;s fiat currency, potentially offering faster and more secure domestic and international payments.</p>
<strong>A $500 Billion Market By 2026</strong>
<p>Mastercard predicts the digital remittance market share to reach over $500 billion by 2026, reflecting an annual growth rate of nearly 10%. Interestingly, Ripple has a much bolder prediction, estimating the entire cross-border payment market to reach a staggering $250 trillion by 2027.</p>

<p>Mastercard&#8217;s recognition of Ripple is a significant development for the crypto company. It validates Ripple&#8217;s technology and its potential to address the long-standing issues plaguing remittance services, particularly in Latin America. While the two entities have different outlooks on market size, both agree on the significant growth potential in the cross-border payments sector.</p>





Following the news of Ripple&#8217;s recognition by Mastercard for XRP-based remittances, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">XRP</a> experienced a notable 3% rise in its price. This positive movement in XRP&#8217;s value reflects the market&#8217;s optimism and confidence in the potential collaboration between Ripple and Mastercard, signaling a favorable response to the integration of XRP into Mastercard&#8217;s payment network.

<title>KuCoin Charged By DOJ As ‘Money Laundering Hub’ In Alleged $9B Scheme</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/kucoin-faces-doj-prosecution/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/kucoin-faces-doj-prosecution/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。美国联邦检察官起诉加密货币交易所KuCoin及其两位创始人违反反洗钱法。指控他们故意违反反洗钱和银行保密法，并没有按照基本的反洗钱政策运营。调查声称KuCoin收到超过50亿美元，并发送了逾40亿美元的可疑和犯罪资金。检察部门称，KuCoin、Gan和Tang故意忽略反洗钱义务，直到2023年7月才开始实施了KYC计划。 Gan和Tang，两位中国籍公民如果被判有罪，每项违反银行保密法和未经注册的经营未许可的最高判刑为5年。当前，KCS代币的交易价格已经受到这一消息和DOJ提出的指控的影响，目前正在12.76美元进行交易，短短一个小时内下跌了10%。 <div>
<p>In a significant development, federal prosecutors in the United States have <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/prominent-global-cryptocurrency-exchange-kucoin-and-two-its-founders-criminally" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">charged </a>cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin and two of its founders with violating anti-money laundering (AML) laws.</p>
<h2>Founders Face DOJ Charges </h2>
<p>The US Department of Justice (DOJ) unsealed an indictment against KuCoin and its founders, Chun Gan (also known as &#8220;Michael&#8221;) and Ke Tang (also known as &#8220;Eric&#8221;), for their alleged involvement in conspiring to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business and conspiring to violate the Bank Secrecy Act. </p>
<p>The indictment accuses them of “willfully” failing to maintain an effective AML program designed to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing.</p>

<p>According to Damian Williams, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, KuCoin deliberately concealed the fact that a significant number of its users were trading on its platform, and allegedly taking advantage of its US customer base to become one of the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. </p>
<p>However, the defendants allegedly failed to comply with US laws, including basic AML policies, allowing KuCoin to operate as a “hub for illicit money laundering.” The indictment claims that KuCoin received over $5 billion and sent over $4 billion of suspicious and criminal funds.</p>
<p>The investigation further claims that KuCoin, founded in September 2017 by Chun Gan and Ke Tang, actively solicited business from US customers through its spot and futures trading platforms.</p>
<p>Despite its growth, with over 30 million customers and significant daily trading volume, the DOJ alleges that KuCoin evaded AML obligations required for money transmitting businesses, including registration with the US Department of Treasury&#8217;s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and the US Commodity and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).</p>
<h2>KuCoin Accused Of Evading AML And KYC Requirements</h2>
<p>The indictment further alleges that KuCoin, Gan, and Tang were aware of their AML obligations but deliberately chose to disregard them. According to the DOJ’s investigations, until July 2023, KuCoin had no customer identification requirements in place, implementing a belated KYC (know-your-customer) program only after being notified of the federal investigation. </p>
<p>However, the prosecution contends that this program applied solely to new customers, leaving millions of existing customers, including a significant number in the United States, unchecked. </p>
<p>The indictment also accuses Gan, Tang, and KuCoin of “actively” concealing the existence of US customers in an attempt to evade AML and KYC requirements. In its announcement, the DOJ claimed that KuCoin prevented its US customers from identifying themselves as such during the account registration process. </p>

<p>If convicted, Gan and Tang, both Chinese citizens, could face a maximum sentence of five years in prison for each count of conspiring to violate the Bank Secrecy Act and conspiring to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business.</p>
<img alt="KuCoin" class="size-large" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/MGDQb7rh/" width="1814" />
<p>As of the current update, the native token of the exchange, KCS, has experienced a substantial impact following the disclosure of the news and the charges brought by the DOJ. At present, the KCS token is trading at $12.76, reflecting a significant decrease of 10% within a mere one-hour timeframe.</p>

<title>Shiba Inu Held On Exchanges Falls To 2-Year Low, What This Means</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-exchanges-2-year-low/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-exchanges-2-year-low/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章指出Shiba Inu加密货币正受到投资者青睐，其交易所持有的数量已大幅减少至两年来的最低水平。此外，SHIB的供应量持续下降，同时在交易所之外的供应量持续增加。交易所流入量也显着减少，表明投资者可能在等待更高的价格再次出售。预测Shiba Inu在本牛市中将表现出色，并有可能超过其历史最高价。 <div>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inus-shibarium-hits-new-record-amid-chaotic-market-movements/">The Shiba Inu (SHIB) ecosystem</a> is gaining traction, as different metrics suggest that investors are more bullish on the meme coin than ever. One of these metrics is the latest development, which shows that the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-outperform-dogecoin/">number of SHIB tokens</a> held on exchanges has drastically reduced. </p>
<h2>Shiba Inu On Exchanges Drops To 2-Year Low</h2>
<p><a href="https://studio.glassnode.com/metrics?a=SHIB&amp;category=Entities&amp;m=distribution.BalanceExchanges&amp;s=1553676596&amp;u=1711356596&amp;zoom=1825" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Data</a> from <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bull-market-glassnode/">crypto analytics firm Glassnode</a> shows that the amount of SHIB held on exchanges has dropped to its lowest level since March 2022. This underscores the bullish sentiment among SHIB investors, as the decline in the meme coin’s supply invariably means that these investors are choosing to hold for the long term rather than offloading their holdings anytime soon. </p>

<p><a href="https://app.santiment.net/charts/iXhlYy3R__sCl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Data</a> from the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/why-these-2-altcoins-could-witness-price-bumps/">on-chain analytics platform Santiment</a> also shows the steady decline in the SHIB supply on exchanges, which currently stands at just over 75 trillion (7% of the token’s circulating supply). At the same time, the supply outside of exchanges has continued to climb, currently standing at over 925 trillion SHIB. </p>
<p>Another metric that signals bullish sentiment for the meme coin is the daily exchange inflow recorded. <a href="https://app.santiment.net/charts/iXhlYy3R__sCl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Data</a> from Santiment shows that this figure has also significantly reduced. For context, over 3 trillion SHIB was <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-transactions-spree/">moved to exchange wallets</a> on March 1, and on March 22, only about 376 million SHIB was transferred to exchanges. </p>
<p>These figures suggest a drop in the short-term sell pressure as investors might be easing off on taking profits from the meme coin. This creates room for SHIB to enjoy another parabolic price surge since there is the likelihood that the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-whale-dumps-substantial-holdings-on-the-market-heres-how-much/">short-term holders</a> have already exited their positions. </p>
<h2>Shiba Inu To Make A Statement In This Bull Run</h2>
<p>This bullish stance on SHIB isn’t surprising, as the meme coin is projected to be one of the crypto tokens that will stand out in this <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bull-market-glassnode/">bull run</a>. <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-lead-dev-prediction/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Shiba Inu’s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama</a>, also <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-lead-dev-shib-bull/">boldly claimed</a> that SHIB is well-positioned as the leading <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-based-wif-meme-coins/">meme coin</a> in this market cycle. </p>

<p>Investors’ faith in SHIB is <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/dogecoin-shiba-inu-pepe-explode/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">further strengthened</a> by the fact that meme coins look to be one of the leading narratives of this cycle. As such, some of the spotlight will shine on SHIB as the second-largest meme coin by market cap, which could positively reflect its price. </p>
<p>Crypto analysts have also weighed in on SHIB’s future trajectory and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-surge-crypto-shib/#:~:text=Shiba%20Inu%20To%20See%20A%20300%25%20Gain%20Before%20Year%2Dend&amp;text=Looking%20at%20SHIB&#039;s%20chart%2C%20the,invest%20in%20the%20crypto%20token.">predicted</a> that the crypto token will likely surpass its all-time high (ATH) of $0.00008845 in this bull market. Although ambitious, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-analyst-predicts-1300-for-cardano/">crypto analyst Ali Martinez</a> <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/122000-surge-shiba-inu-price/">predicted</a> that SHIB could rise to as high as $0.011 at some point. </p>

<title>Bitcoin Whale Profits Soar To $16.3 Billion Despite Mixed Spot BTC ETF Flows</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-whale-profits-mixed-spot-btc-etf-flows/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-whale-profits-mixed-spot-btc-etf-flows/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。CryptoQuant创始人Ki Young Ju指出，历史性的流入对短期鲸鱼交易者，包括现货比特币交易所交易基金（ETF）买家的盈利能力至关重要。比特币价格在周末快速上涨至70000美元以上。现货比特币ETF继续影响比特币价格走势，总资产管理规模已达到600亿美元。虽然过去一周出现了五个连续的资金外流日，但在Fidelity的FBTC带领下，资金流入也有所回升。未来的资金流入是否会加速，价格是否会回升仍有待观察。 <div>
<p>Ki Young Ju, the founder of CryptoQuant, a crypto analytics platform, now <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/ki_young_ju/status/1772576789430165966" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">says</a> historic inflow into Bitcoin is the key driver of profitability among short-term whales, including spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) buyers. </p>
<p>Referencing on-chain data, the founder notes that these investors have amassed roughly $16.3 billion in unrealized profit, translating to a gain of about 16%. </p>

<h2>BTC Snaps Back Bullish After Correcting Lower</h2>
<p>The revelation comes roughly a day after the world&#8217;s most valuable coin broke back above $70,000, extending gains over the weekend. After a series of lower lows threatened to wipe out gains, the coin rose sharply over the weekend, breaking above the $69,000 resistance level.</p>

<p>When writing on March 16, BTC is trading above the middle BB, a dynamic price level chartists use to mark out resistance or support, depending on the trend. The extension on March 25 might also spur more demand, lifting the coin above $73,800 and to new territory.</p>
<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/x/2IegTaI3/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Bitcoin price trending upward on the daily chart | Source: BTCUSDT on Binance, TradingView" class="size-full" height="904" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/2IegTaI3/" width="1787" /></a>
<p>Spot Bitcoin ETFs continue to shape the coin&#8217;s price action. Even before approval in mid-January 2024, rumors of its green lighting by the strict United States Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-ceo-predicts-sec-setback-in-ethereum-case/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">SEC</a>) lifted prices. </p>
<p>The coin rallied above $40,000, reaching highs of around $47,200 on January 8. After the approval, prices briefly contracted before rocketing higher, registering new all-time highs in early March 2024.</p>
<p>Interest in spot Bitcoin ETFs has seen its total assets under management (AUM) surge to $60 billion in around ten weeks. It took Gold ETFs approximately 15 years to reach the same milestone. This uptick points to the upswing in demand, possibly from other players and institutions seeking exposure to the asset.</p>
<img alt="Gold versus Bitcoin ETFs AUM | Source: Analyst on X" class="size-full wp-image-289738" height="389" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GJltl5laEAAqmab.jpg?resize=748%2C389" width="748" />
<h2>Eyes On Inflows Into Spot Bitcoin ETFs</h2>
<p>Still, while spot Bitcoin ETFs shape price action, cracks are beginning to emerge. The past week marked the second time in the coin&#8217;s history to record five consecutive days of outflows. Increased outflow coincided with Bitcoin prices edging lower, dropping to as low as $63,500. However, this trend ended on March 25, with Fidelity&#8217;s FBTC leading the rebound. </p>

<p>For now, it remains to be seen whether inflow will pick up pace in the sessions ahead. If more capital flows to spot Bitcoin ETF issuers, reversing last week&#8217;s impact, it is highly likely that prices will also recover. Even so, whether the coin will break above $74,000 ahead of Bitcoin halving is unclear.</p>

<title>UK Embraces Crypto: Bitcoin And Ethereum ETNs Coming To London Stock Exchange</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/uk-embraces-crypto-bitcoin-and-ethereum-etns-coming-to-london-stock-exchange/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/uk-embraces-crypto-bitcoin-and-ethereum-etns-coming-to-london-stock-exchange/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。伦敦证券交易所（LSE）宣布将推出比特币和以太坊交易所交易债券（ETN），以迎接加密市场的增长。该举措标志着LSE意识到机构投资者对加密货币的日益关注，并旨在成为数字资产受监管交易的关键参与者。ETN上市将允许投资者安全地获得比特币和以太坊的表现，而不必直接购买和持有这些数字资产。这一举措将在2024年5月28日推出，初期参与将仅限于专业投资者。 <div>
<p>The London Stock Exchange (LSE), facing declining listings and trading activity, is making a strategic move to embrace the booming crypto market. In a notice released today, the LSE announced the<a href="https://docs.londonstockexchange.com/sites/default/files/documents/n0324.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> launch of a brand new market</a> dedicated to Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded notes (ETNs), set to debut on May 28th, 2024.</p>

<p>This initiative marks a significant shift for the LSE, traditionally known for housing established blue-chip stocks. It signifies a recognition of the growing institutional investor interest in cryptocurrencies, and the LSE&#8217;s intent to become a key player in the regulated trading of digital assets.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-289640" height="196" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_db1492.png?resize=693%2C196" width="693" /></p>
<h2><strong>Opening The Doors For Crypto Exposure</strong></h2>
<p>The new market will allow companies to list ETNs that track the performance of <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bitcoin and Ethereum</a>, two of the leading cryptocurrencies. This provides investors with a regulated and secure way to gain exposure to these digital assets without directly buying and holding them.</p>
<p>Applications for listing these ETNs will open on April 8th, giving issuers enough time to meet the LSE&#8217;s requirements and obtain approval from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) for their prospectuses.</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s important to note that participation in this initial launch will be restricted to &#8220;professional investors&#8221; only. This category encompasses authorized credit institutions and investment firms, essentially excluding retail investors from accessing these ETNs at the outset.</p>
<p>This may raise questions about inclusivity, but the LSE&#8217;s focus on establishing a robust regulatory framework for crypto trading could pave the way for broader participation in the future.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/izpHIjWo/" width="1835" /></p>

<h2><strong>A Calculated Move Amidst Challenges</strong></h2>
<p>The LSE&#8217;s foray into crypto comes at a time when the exchange is grappling with several challenges. According to a recent Bloomberg report, the number of companies listing on the LSE has witnessed a dramatic decline, with 2023 recording the lowest number of IPOs since 2009.</p>
<p>Trading activity has also shrunk significantly compared to pre-crisis levels. This decline can be attributed to factors like shifting investor preferences, competition from other exchanges, and an evolving regulatory landscape.</p>
<p>The digital asset market, with its burgeoning institutional investor base, presents a unique opportunity for the LSE to revitalize its position. By creating a secure and well-regulated environment for crypto trading, the LSE can attract investments and potentially help the UK maintain its edge in the global digital asset economy.</p>

<strong>Unveiling The Nuances: ETNs Vs ETFs</strong>
<p>While both ETNs and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offer exposure to underlying assets, there are key differences in their structures. ETFs function like baskets of stocks or other holdings that investors partially own.</p>
<p>In contrast, ETNs are more akin to unsecured debt notes issued by a bank. The bank uses the proceeds from these notes to invest in assets that track a specific index, like Bitcoin or Ethereum in this case. The value of the ETN reflects the performance of those underlying assets.</p>
<p>Essentially, when you buy an ETF share, you&#8217;re acquiring a portion of the actual assets it holds. With an ETN, you&#8217;re essentially loaning money to the bank in exchange for a note that promises a return based on the performance of the underlying index it tracks.</p>
<strong>The Road Ahead: A Cautious Optimism</strong>
<p>The LSE&#8217;s crypto ETN launch is a positive development for the UK&#8217;s digital asset ambitions. It demonstrates the LSE&#8217;s willingness to adapt to evolving market trends and cater to growing investor interest.</p>
<p>However, the initial exclusion of retail investors and the success of the new market in attracting issuers and investors will be crucial factors to watch. With a well-defined regulatory framework and a focus on inclusivity, the LSE&#8217;s crypto initiative could be a game-changer, propelling it back to the forefront of global financial hubs.</p>

<title>Here’s How A Crypto Trader Made $1.6 Million In One Hour Trading Meme Coins</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-1-6-million-bsc-meme-coin/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章介绍了一位加密交易员在BSC网络上交易一种迷因币而赚取了160万美元的案例。该交易员投入了6000个BNB购买PUMP币，随着PUMP币价格上涨，最终卖出获利160万美元。此外，文章还提到了其他迷因币在市场上表现出色的情况，如PEPE币和BOME币等，展示了人们对迷因币的日益增长的兴趣。整体来看，迷因币在加密市场上取得了显著的增长和成功。 <div>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/top-ai-meme-coins/">Meme coin trading</a> has been heating up across a number of networks and a lot of crypto traders have become richer for it. Mainly, Solana <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-investing-meme-coins/">meme coins continue to dominate</a>, but other networks such as the BSC network is beginning to see an uptick in interest. One crypto trader in particular made $1.6 million in one hour trading a meme coin on the BSC network. Here’s how they did it.</p>
<h2>Crypto Trader Makes $1.6 Million With BSC-Based Meme Coin</h2>
<p class="p1">Large meme coin launches have been happening over the last month, with multiple memes running to tens of millions of dollars in a matter of days. This was no different in the case of the Big Pump (PUMP) token which launched on the BSC blockchain on March 25.</p>

<p class="p1">Taking advantage of the hype surrounding the token launch, a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bnb-whales-dump-millions-of-busd/">BNB whale</a> used 6,000 BNB to buy into PUMP. At the time of the buy, the 6,000 BNB was worth $3.48 million, and the crypto trader received 375.4 billion PUMP tokens in return.</p>
<p class="p1">As the price of the PUMP coin grew over the next hour, so did the whale’s holdings, eventually crossing $5 million. According to data from Lookonchain, the crypto trader proceeded to sell 360.4 billion PUMP tokens across a number of transactions for a total of $5.08 million. Taking out their initial capital, the trader realized a $1.6 million profit from this single sale.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">After <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24PUMP&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">$PUMP</a> opened trading, a whale made 2,759 <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BNB&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">$BNB</a>($1.6M) on <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24PUMP&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">$PUMP</a> in less than 1 hour!</p>

<p></p>
<p class="p1">The crypto trader had initially left a balance of 15 billion PUMP tokens, as Lookonchain data shows. However, they proceeded to offload another 5 billion tokens, leaving their current balance at the time of this writing at 10 billion. This <a href="https://bscscan.com/token/0x22b4fa9a13a0d303ad258ee6d62a6ac60364b0c9?a=0x3dca07e16b2becd3eb76a9f9ce240b525451f887" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">balance</a> is worth $122,624 at PUMP’s current trading price of $0.00001224.</p>
<h2 class="p1">Meme Coins Lead Market Gains</h2>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-investing-meme-coins/">Meme coins have been the leaders of this bull cycle</a> so far with impressive run from a number of crypto coins that fall in this category. The PEPE coin had revived the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/top-ai-meme-coins/">meme coin movement</a>, and then it was propelled further by the likes of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-meme-coins-myro-wif/">Solana-based BONK and WIF</a> which have all crossed the billion-dollar mark in the space of a year.</p>

<p class="p1">As the market heads further into the bull cycle, there have been other meme coins that have turned heads during this time. One of these meme coins is Book of Meme (BOME), a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-based-wif-meme-coins/">meme coin</a> which got a Binance listing and crossed the $1 billion market cap mark all within a day.</p>
<p class="p1">Others have followed this trajectory as the likes of SLERF also ran to over $200 million in one day. The BSC-based PUMP token also crossed a $50 million market cap on its first day, signaling a growing interest in meme coins no matter the blockchain.</p>

<title>Do Kwon And Terra Vs. SEC: Day 1 Is Off To A Hot Start</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/do-kwon-terra-vs-sec-day-1/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/do-kwon-terra-vs-sec-day-1/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章讨论了Terraform Labs和其创始人Do Kwon与美国证券交易委员会（SEC）之间的审判。审判在曼哈顿开始，由九名陪审团成员听取双方的开场陈述。SEC指控Terraform Labs欺诈，并称TerraUSD稳定性问题是欺诈行为。辩护方则强调失败与欺诈意图之间的区别，并将展示Terra的区块链技术在Chai应用程序中的实际使用。审判仍在进行中，双方预计将提供详细证据和专家证词支持其立场。 <div>
<p>The much-anticipated civil <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/terraform-labs-in-the-hot-seat-trial-begins/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">trial</a> between Terraform Labs, its embattled founder Do Kwon, and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began on Monday in Manhattan, marking a pivotal moment in the ongoing scrutiny of the crypto space and regulatory oversight.</p>
<h2>Do Kwon / Terra Trial: Day 1</h2>
<p>Zack Guzmán, the award-winning Web3 host and founder of Coinage Media, was live on site and provided a summary from the courthouse via X, noting a stark contrast in attendance compared to the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-to-gangster-sbf-photo-in-jail-comes-to-light/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) trial.</a> Despite the lesser crowd, the significance of the trial was palpable, with both parties presenting their opening arguments before a carefully selected jury of nine – a process that included its share of courtroom levity, particularly from US District Judge Jed Rakoff.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">NEW: Do Kwon / Terra vs. SEC off to a hot start in Manhattan court today</p>
<p>We already got a jury selected along with opening statements from both the SEC and defense teams (plus’s some pretty hilarious material from Judge Rakoff) </p>
<p>Here’s everything from Day 1 <img alt="🧵" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f9f5.png" style="height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/vl74lUgFZs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/vl74lUgFZs</a></p>

<p></p>
<p>Guzmán remarked, “Eventually landed on a jury of just 3 men and 6 women &#8211; mostly minorities. Of the three men, one is divorced, [&#8230;] The divorcee is rocking a New York Giants jacket. Judge Rakoff jokes that he is also a Giants fan… “That’s why I’m wearing black, because I am in mourning.”</p>
<p>Related Reading: <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/terraform-labs-in-the-hot-seat-trial-begins/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Terraform Labs In The Hot Seat: Trial Begins As Do Kwon’s Final Extradition Decision Looms</a></p>
<p>Besides that, Judge Rakoff and the opening statements set the tone for what promises to be an intense legal confrontation. Rakoff laid out ground rules from the jump: &#8220;Trial expected to take 2 weeks. Only 4-word objections allowed. The only way you can get me mad is a speedy objection. You say 3 words: ‘Objection, lack of foundation&#8217;.”</p>
<p>The SEC&#8217;s opening salvo framed the case as a clear instance of fraud, drawing parallels to arguments used in the recent trial against Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX. Central to the SEC&#8217;s accusations are claims that Terraform Labs misrepresented the use of its blockchain in the Chai mobile payment app and misled investors about the stability of its <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/terraform-labs-files-for-bankruptcy-in-the-us/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">TerraUSD stablecoin</a>, which was designed to maintain a peg to the dollar.</p>
<p>Attorney Devon Staren presented a concise yet potent argument: &#8220;Terra was a fraud, a house of cards, and when it collapsed, investors lost nearly everything.&#8221; On the other side, Terraform&#8217;s defense, articulated by David Patton, pivoted on a critical distinction between failure and fraudulent intent.</p>

<p>Patton&#8217;s assertion, &#8220;Failure doesn’t equal fraud,&#8221; seeks to challenge the SEC&#8217;s narrative by suggesting that the collapse of TerraUSD was a consequence of market volatility rather than deceptive practices by Terraform Labs and Do Kwon.</p>
<p>The SEC&#8217;s case hinges on two main allegations: that Terraform Labs and Do Kwon misrepresented the stability and functionality of TerraUSD and that it falsely claimed its blockchain was utilized in the Chai payment app. These claims are not just about investor losses but also about trust in the blockchain ecosystem and the integrity of its architects.</p>
<p>Terraform&#8217;s defense strategy involves not only refuting these allegations but also highlighting the innovative nature of their work in the cryptocurrency space. The defense hints at forthcoming evidence that will demonstrate the actual usage of Terra&#8217;s blockchain technology in the Chai app, countering the SEC&#8217;s claims of misinformation.</p>
<p>As the trial against Do Kwon progresses, both parties are expected to present detailed evidence and expert testimonies to support their arguments. The SEC will likely delve deeper into the technical and financial mechanisms that led to TerraUSD&#8217;s instability, while Terraform&#8217;s defense will aim to contextualize the challenges and uncertainties inherent in pioneering new financial technologies.</p>
<p>At press time, Terra Luna Classic (LUNC) traded at $0.000169259.</p>
<img alt="Terra Luna Classic price" class="size-full wp-image-289665" height="472" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/LUNCUSD_2024-03-26_10-12-11.png?resize=1024%2C472" width="1024" />

<title>Ethereum Spot ETF Mirrors Bitcoin’s Trailblazing Strength: Grayscale CLO</title>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的<br />格瑞斯卡莱首席法律官克雷格·萨尔姆对以太坊现货交易所交易基金（ETF）的未来充满信心，认为与比特币现货ETF相似，以太坊现货ETF的通过案例同样强有力。他强调美国证监会与申请人互动的积极性，指出与比特币ETF类似，以太坊ETF的流程基本相同。萨尔姆还强调了现货与期货之间的强关联性，并支持以太坊ETF的批准。格瑞斯卡莱公司期待与监管机构讨论这些重要产品。虽然目前以太坊交易产品的批准几率有所下降，但仍显示出积极信心。 <div>
<p>Amid uncertainty around Ethereum Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), Grayscale Chief Legal Officer (CLO) Craig Salm has <a href="https://x.com/CraigSalm/status/1772360837094691302?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">expressed</a> his insights on the subject, addressing the similarities between Ethereum and Bitcoin spot ETFs.</p>
<h2>Ethereum Spot ETFs Is Just As Strong As Bitcoin Spot ETFs</h2>
<p>Craig Salm appears optimistic about the Ethereum spot ETFs&#8217; approval from the United States <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/a16z-crypto-lawyer-us-sec-spot-ethereum-etfs/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</a>, as he believes &#8220;the case for the products is just as strong as it was for Bitcoin ETFs.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Grayscale&#8217;s CLO underscored his unwavering confidence in the products&#8217; approval, despite ongoing negative speculations within the crypto landscape. However, his main goal is to shed light on how the SEC&#8217;s engagement with applicants in the situation is perceived.</p>

<p>Addressing the Commission&#8217;s engagement, Salm drew the community&#8217;s attention to the final months before <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-btc-etf-approved-ethereum-eth-next/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin ETFs</a> were approved, noting that during this period, the SEC engaged with Grayscale and several other issuers positively and contructively.</p>
<p>In addition, there were thoughtful discussions about the specifics of creation/redemption processes, cash vs. in-kind, APs, LPs, custody, and among others. Drawing a parallel between Ethereum and Bitcoin ETFs, Salm stated that the process is identical, suggesting a potential approval.</p>
<p>According to him, the only aspect that proves to be different is that the ETF holds <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-price-reach-14000/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">ETH</a> instead of BTC. Thus, issuers essentially have less to interact with at this time because the regulatory watchdog has already engaged in numerous ways.</p>
<p>Due to this, Salm is optimistic despite the uncertainty surrounding the final approval dates, arguing that results should not be determined by what is perceived as a lack of regulatory engagement.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the CLO highlighted his complete alignment with crypto figures such as Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal and Brian Quintenz&#8217;s opinions regarding the necessity of approving Ethereum spot ETFs.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that Paul Grawel previously contested the SEC&#8217;s stance, claiming that the regulatory agency lacked sufficient evidence to categorize Ethereum as a security or legitimate grounds for rejecting ETH exchange-traded products.</p>
<h2>Strong Correlation Between Futures And Spot</h2>
<p>While resonating with opinions from the aforementioned figures, Salm supports the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/approval-denial-ethereum-etf-sell-the-news-event/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">approval of ETH ETFs</a> because they should be considered commodity futures and consistent with ETH futures ETFs. This is due to his belief that there is a strong connection between futures and spots.</p>

<p>Finally, Salm asserts that investors want and deserve to be exposed to ETH through ETFs, while underlining Grayscale&#8217;s belief that the case for spot Ethereum ETFs reflects similar strength as spot Bitcoin ETFs, reiterating the firm&#8217;s support for approval. In the meantime, the company anticipates discussing these significant products with the agency.</p>
<p>So far, the approval odds for the ETH exchange products have witnessed a substantial decline over time. <a href="https://polymarket.com/event/ethereum-etf-approved-by-may-31?tid=1711444026959" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Data</a> from Polymarket reveals that the odds are presently down to around 27%.</p>

<title>BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Beats OKX And Kraken Holdings Combined</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-beats-okx-and-kraken-holdings/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-beats-okx-and-kraken-holdings/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章介绍了世界上最大的资产管理公司BlackRock通过其iShares比特币信托（IBIT）在比特币所有权方面的主导地位，已超过许多传统交易所和主要公司投资者。IBIT的快速增长被归因于机构投资者对比特币作为一种可行资产类别的信心增强。它还指出BlackRock的ETF可能在未来几周内超过Grayscale的比特币信托（GBTC）在比特币持有方面的地位。这标志着比特币市场的新时代，为进一步的机构投资铺平了道路。 <div>
<p>In a move signaling a major shift in the cryptocurrency landscape, BlackRock, the world&#8217;s largest asset manager, has emerged as a dominant force in Bitcoin ownership through its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). Launched in mid-January 2024, IBIT has rapidly accumulated Bitcoin (BTC) holdings, surpassing not only established crypto exchanges but also major corporate investors.</p>

<p>Financial analysts are attributing this rapid growth to a surge in institutional investor confidence in Bitcoin as a viable asset class. Traditionally, investing in cryptocurrency has been a complex process for institutional investors, often involving navigating unregulated exchanges and securing private wallets.</p>
<h2><strong>BlackRock Edges OKX, Kraken In Bitcoin ETF Investments</strong></h2>
<p>ETFs, like IBIT, offer a more familiar and regulated framework, similar to investing in stocks or bonds. This accessibility is seen as a key driver behind the massive inflows into IBIT, which currently boasts over 243,130 BTC, according to crypto analyst Ali.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">BlackRock’s <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">#Bitcoin</a> ETF launched in mid-January 2024 and now it holds more <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">$BTC</a> than OKX and Kraken combined, which launched in 2017 and 2011, respectively. <a href="https://t.co/3cVtdaYa55" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/3cVtdaYa55</a></p>
<p>— Ali (@ali_charts) <a href="https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1772017123927207977?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">March 24, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>This figure eclipses the combined holdings of prominent crypto exchanges OKX (132,500 BTC) and Kraken (77,300 BTC), both of which have been operational for significantly longer. The shift suggests a potential power move, with traditional financial institutions like BlackRock taking the reins from crypto-native exchanges in managing Bitcoin assets.</p>
<p>BlackRock&#8217;s dominance extends beyond exchanges. IBIT&#8217;s holdings even surpass those of MicroStrategy, a well-known corporate advocate for Bitcoin, which currently holds an estimated 214,246 BTC. This unexpected development highlights the growing institutional appetite for Bitcoin and the potential for IBIT to influence the overall market.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/mtYAD08D/" width="2475" /></p>

<p>Analysts like Ali point to a possible correlation between IBIT&#8217;s growth and rising Bitcoin prices. The recent surge in Bitcoin&#8217;s value, currently hovering around $66,948, could be fueled in part by the increasing demand for IBIT. Additionally, Ali suggests that a sustained break above $66,990 could trigger a further rise towards $72,880.</p>
<h2><strong>BlackRock&#8217;s ETF Could Surpass GBTC In Bitcoin Holdings</strong></h2>
<p>IBIT&#8217;s rapid growth also poses a challenge to Grayscale&#8217;s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the long-standing leader in Bitcoin ETFs. With average daily inflows of $274 million and an estimated 4,120 new Bitcoin entering IBIT every day, it&#8217;s projected to surpass GBTC&#8217;s holdings within the next three weeks. GBTC, conversely, has experienced outflows exceeding $277 million over the past two weeks.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-289650" height="682" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_44f8fb.png?resize=642%2C682" width="642" /></p>

<p>While the future trajectory of Bitcoin prices remains speculative, BlackRock&#8217;s involvement undoubtedly signifies a new era for the cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>The world&#8217;s largest asset manager&#8217;s commitment to Bitcoin through IBIT lends legitimacy to the asset class and paves the way for further institutional investment. With its growing influence, BlackRock is poised to become a major player in shaping the future of Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Bonanza: Peruvian Gold Miner Intends To Buy $1.7 Billion</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-peruvian-gold-miner-1-7-billion/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。周一，秘鲁金矿商Nilam Resources, Inc.宣布拟收购24,800比特币，为公司的多元化和创新奠定了基础。该交易将通过发行新授权的优先级C系列股票进行，以超过10亿美元的数字资产作为抵押提高资本。有关交易条款和战略细节将在后续确定性协议中澄清，这将是Nilam Resources在公共金融市场中的重要未来里程碑。此举受到比特币社区的怀疑和谨慎态度，尤其是一些知名人士提出了质疑。 <div>
<p>On Monday, Peruvian gold miner Nilam Resources, Inc. (OTC PINK: NILA) has <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2024/03/25/2851986/0/en/Nilam-Resources-Enters-Letters-of-Intent-to-Acquire-24-800-Bitcoin.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> its intention to acquire a staggering 24,800 Bitcoin (BTC). The strategic initiative comes via a Letter of Intent (LOI) with Xyberdata Ltd, setting the stage for the acquisition of 100% of the common stock of MindWave, a special purpose entity to be established in Mauritius for holding the digital assets.</p>
<h2>Following The Saylor Playbook</h2>
<p>This significant shift towards digital asset investment by Nilam Resources involves the issuance of a newly authorized Preferred Class of Series C Stock, offered in exchange for the Bitcoin at a discount relative to current market prices. With the transaction, Nilam aims to secure digital assets exceeding one billion dollars in value, underpinning a broad strategic milestone for the company in its pursuit of diversification and innovation.</p>
<p>Pranjali More, CEO of Nilam Resources, Inc., underscored the strategic importance of the transaction, stating, &#8220;The Company and team have been working diligently over the last several months to finalize all agreements and due diligence necessary to proceed to a legally binding Letter of Intent (LOI).&#8221;</p>

<p>The collaboration with Xyberdata and the establishment of MindWave in Mauritius is part of Nilam&#8217;s strategic vision to harness the potential of Bitcoin. These assets will serve not only as a significant addition to the company&#8217;s portfolio but also as collateral to raise capital for investment in high-yield generating projects.</p>
<p>This move aligns with NILA&#8217;s broader objectives of fostering a finance ecosystem that is inclusive, sustainable, and defined by transparency, innovation, and sustainability. &#8220;We prioritize clear communication, embrace cutting-edge ideas, and invest in projects with enduring social and environmental impact,&#8221; added Pranjali More.</p>
<p>The acquisition terms and further strategic details are anticipated to be laid out in subsequent definitive agreements. The completion of this acquisition will see MindWave becoming a fully owned subsidiary of Nilam Resources, with MindWave shareholders exchanging their equity interest for the newly issued Preferred Stock (Class C).</p>
<p>This class of stock will entail conversion rights upon a listing on NASDAQ or another national exchange, among other liquidity events, signaling a significant future milestone for Nilam Resources in the public financial markets.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Community Reacts With Doubts</h2>
<p>However, the announcement has been met with skepticism and caution by several notable figures within the Bitcoin community. Matthew Sigel, Head of digital assets research at <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etf-by-vaneck-benefit-btc-core-developers/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">VanEck</a>, hinted at Nilam&#8217;s strategic inspiration, <a href="https://twitter.com/hodlonaut/status/1772363033219678419" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">stating</a>, &#8220;IN SAYLOR HE TRUSTS &#8211;&gt;MOGO, $50M market cap payments company, which owns 13% stake in crypto exchange WonderFi (WNDR CN, mkt cap $180M) announces plans to add Bitcoin to company treasury.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tuur Demeester, a respected Bitcoin OG and analyst for Adamant Research, <a href="https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1772363440729800984" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">expressed</a> his reservations more bluntly: &#8220;I removed my tweet about that gold explorer buying 24k BTC, after a commenter pointed out that it&#8217;s indeed a stunt from a dying penny stock (market cap of $5M). Perhaps it&#8217;s a harbinger of what will come, but this, indeed, is _not_ huge news.&#8221;</p>

<p>This sentiment reflects a broader skepticism about the motivations behind Nilam&#8217;s <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/microstrategy-1-of-all-bitcoin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">pivot to Bitcoin</a>, questioning the solidity of the company&#8217;s financial strategy.</p>
<p>Criticism also came from @hodlonaut, who <a href="https://twitter.com/hodlonaut/status/1772363033219678419" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">voiced</a> concerns about the nature of the transaction and the methods Nilam might employ to secure the funds for such a significant purchase, stating, &#8220;Not sure what type of fiat abomination NILAM is, or what type of accounting voodoo they intend to deploy to raise the funds, but I do know they want 24,800 btc and that there will never be more than 21M. A <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-halving-and-spot-etfs-the-impending-btc-supply-shock/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">storm is brewing</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bitcoin analyst Dyan LeClair <a href="https://twitter.com/DylanLeClair_/status/1772366591495135537" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">added</a> that MOGO is a microcap OTC stock, &#8220;so this can only work if there is demand for the equity sale. A letter of intent is one thing, actually executing is another. Likely flops, and is for PR purposes. On the contrary, we live in meme world, who knows what happens.&#8221;</p>
<p>At press time, BTC traded at $70,316.</p>

<title>FTX Set To Cash In $884 Million From Majority Stake Sale In Anthropic</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-set-to-cash-in-884-million-from-sale-anthropic/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-set-to-cash-in-884-million-from-sale-anthropic/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />FTX加密交易所将以8.84亿美元的价格出售其在人工智能初创公司Anthropic中的三分之二股权，以偿还债务并增加现金储备。该交易涉及包括阿联酋穆巴达拉（Mubadala）、Jane Street、Fidelity Management and Research以及风险投资公司HOF Capital在内的买家。交易所投资5亿美元于Anthropic，并在破产面临指控后于2021年拥有8%的股权。销售此股权预计将有助于FTX偿还债务，并巩固其财务地位。 <div>
<p>Bankrupt crypto exchange FTX will sell two-thirds of its stake in artificial intelligence (AI) startup Anthropic for $884 million, according to a Bloomberg <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/ftx-to-sell-majority-of-anthropic-stake-for-884-million" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>. The move comes as FTX seeks to repay its creditors and bolster its cash reserves. </p>
<p>The sale involves various buyers, including ATIC Third International Investment Company LLC, associated with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/uaes-address-unauthorized-digital-asset-usage/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">sovereign wealth fund</a> Mubadala, Jane Street, Fidelity Management and Research, and venture capital firm HOF Capital.</p>
<h2>FTX Approved To Sell Ownership</h2>
<p>In 2021, FTX invested $500 million in Anthropic, a year before facing bankruptcy amidst allegations of fraud. Anthropic, known for its AI research work, attracted significant investments from tech giants <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/amazon-will-invest-4-billion-ftx-backed-ai-startup/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Amazon </a>and Alphabet Inc.&#8217;s Google in 2023, valuing the startup at up to $6 billion.</p>

<p>The FTX bankruptcy estate currently owns an 8% stake in Anthropic, making it one of the estate&#8217;s most valuable assets. As of last month, the estate&#8217;s cash reserves were valued at approximately $6.4 billion. </p>
<p>FTX officials have expressed confidence in repaying all of the company&#8217;s <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sam-bankman-fried-prosecutors-slams-questions-jury/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">creditors</a>, and the sale of the Anthropic stake is expected to significantly contribute to that effort.</p>
<p>As previously <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-creditors-1-billion-crypto/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">reported </a>by Bitcoinist, US bankruptcy Judge John Dorsey approved the decision to sell the Anthropic shares in February. Initially, FTX&#8217;s creditors had reservations about the sale, asserting that FTX had acquired the shares using customer funds. </p>
<p>However, FTX&#8217;s promise to use the sale proceeds to repay its creditors convinced them to approve the proposal. The condition for approval was that the sale proceeds be used to repay the creditors.</p>
<h2>Anthropic Undergoes Ownership Change</h2>
<p>According to Bloomberg, the sale of the majority stake in Anthropic will allow FTX to generate substantial funds, which will be crucial in addressing its financial obligations. </p>
<p>For Anthropic, the sale represents a change in ownership but does not diminish its position as a key artificial intelligence startup. The company&#8217;s previous investments from Amazon and Alphabet Inc.&#8217;s Google have bolstered its position in the rapidly growing field.</p>
<p>Following the sale of the majority of the exchange’s <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/former-ftx-executives-platform-secures-60-million/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">shares </a>in the startup, which company will have the majority of ownership in Antrophic remains to be seen. </p>

<p>FTX&#8217;s decision to sell its majority stake in Anthropic for $884 million is an important step in the bankruptcy reorganization process. By selling its stake, FTX aims to fully repay its creditors and strengthen its financial position. The sale also demonstrates the increased interest in <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/worldcoin-up-46-in-wake-of-altman-board-reunion/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">AI-related startups</a> that has significantly increased the exchange&#8217;s initial $500 million investment. </p>
<img alt="FTX" class="size-large" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/kAtuBUuU/" width="1815" />
<p>As of the current update, the native token of the exchange, FTT, is trading at $2.22, showing a 9% rebound in the last 24 hours. This follows its notable year-to-date surge of 74%. </p>

<title>Crypto Houdini? Binance Exec Escapes From Nigerian Custody Amid Tax Evasion Charges – Report</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。Binance交易所的两名高管之一在尼日利亚当局提出刑事指控后逃离，并于3月22日逃离了尼日利亚。尼日利亚政府控告Binance逃税，并对逃跑的高管提出国际逮捕令。同时，Binance还面临未缴纳增值税、公司所得税等多项指控，政府对其也提起诉讼。 <div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">One of the two senior executives from crypto exchange Binance has escaped from the Nigerian authorities as criminal charges were pressed against him. The executive was <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/nigeria-detains-binances-crypto-crime-investigator/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">first detained</a> on February 26 as part of Nigeria’s actions against the exchange.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">According to local reports, Nigeria’s Federal Government filed Tax evasion charges against Binance amid the escapist turmoil.</p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">From Binance Executive To Crypto Escapist</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A Nigerian newspaper <a href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/680511-exclusive-detained-binance-executive-escapes-from-custody-in-nigeria.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">revealed</a> that Nadeem Anjarwalla, one of the two detained Binance executives, escaped from the government’s custody almost a month after his detention. According to the report, the executive fled the country on March 22.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">After the detention, Anjarwalla remained in custody at an Abuja guest house with Tigran Gambaryan, who was also detained. On Friday, guards on duty took the now-fugitive to a nearby mosque “for prayer in the spirit of the ongoing Ramadan fast.” However, Anjarwalla escaped and allegedly flew out of Abuja on a Middle East Airline.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The logistics for the escape have raised plenty of questions for authorities. The executive, who holds dual British and Kenyan citizenship, had his passport confiscated during the detention.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The investigation has unveiled that the fugitive fled the country with his Kenyan passport. Nonetheless, how he got access to this passport remains a mystery to authorities as he only carried his British travel document when detained in February.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Sources told the local news publication that the guest house where the Binance executives were held was “comfortable” and “allowed many rights.” The phone privileges are now believed to have been exploited by Anjarwalla to plot his escape.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Authorities are working on discovering the fugitive&#8217;s intended destination to get him back into custody. Moreover, the country’s authorities are allegedly in talks with Interpol to issue an international arrest warrant.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A Binance representative <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/25/binance-executive-escapes-nigerian-custody-as-authorities-file-new-tax-charges.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">confirmed</a> to CNBC that the exchange is aware of the situation and affirmed that they are collaborating with Nigerian authorities on the matter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We were made aware that Nadeem is no longer in Nigerian custody. Our primary focus remains on the safety of our employees and we are working collaboratively with Nigerian authorities to quickly resolve this issue.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Binance Faces Tax Evasion Charges In Nigeria</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As reported by Bitcoinist, Nigeria’s <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/nigeria-fines-binance-10-billion/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">crackdown</a> on Binance saw the crypto exchange fined $10 billion earlier this month, alleging that the platform was responsible for the devaluation of the Nigerian naira.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Subsequently, the government sent a request to the exchange’s CEO, Richard Teng. The ultimatum demanded Teng to address the allegations of “terrorist financing, money laundering, and tax evasion” in the country.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The most recent reports <a href="https://punchng.com/fg-files-tax-evasion-charges-against-binance/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">show</a> that the Nigerian government filed tax evasion charges against the crypto exchange as the shocking news of Anjarwalla&#8217;s escape hit the world.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The four charges were filed at the Federal High Court in Abuja by the Federal Inland Revenue Service. Besides Binance, Anjarwalla and Gambaryan appear as the second and third defendants against the accusations.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Per the local report, the charges levied against the exchange include “non-payment of Value-Added Tax, Company Income Tax, failure to file tax returns, and complicity in aiding customers to evade taxes through its platform.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Nigerian federal government also accused the crypto exchange of failing to register with the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) for tax purposes and “contravening existing tax regulations within the country.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In November 2023, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binances-4-3b-settlement-marks-crucial-shift/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Binance</a> pleaded guilty to charges relating to anti-money laundering in the US. This resulted in a $4.3 billion settlement with authorities, including Changpeng Zhao, stepping down as the crypto exchange’s CEO.</p>

<title>SEC Declares Binance A ‘Threat’, Imposes Access Restrictions On Philippine Users</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/binance-users-philippines-face-access-restriction/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。菲律宾证券交易委员会（SEC）阻止当地访问币安，世界上交易量最大的加密货币交易所。SEC指出，币安未获得所需许可证，并未获得批准作为投资和交易平台运营。SEC已要求国家电信委员会（NTC）协助封锁币安的网站和相关页面。此外，币安收购的交易所CommEX已宣布关闭。交易所将逐步停止注册新用户以及其他服务，最终于2024年5月10日关闭官方网站。 <div>
<p>The Philippines Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has taken a significant regulatory step by blocking local access to Binance, the world&#8217;s largest <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-surging-beyond-80000-driven-by-etf-inflows/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">cryptocurrency exchange</a> by trading volume. </p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.sec.gov.ph/pr-2024/sec-proceeds-with-blocking-of-binance/#gsc.tab=0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release </a>issued by the regulator on Monday, the SEC&#8217;s decision was based on Binance&#8217;s failure to obtain the necessary license from the commission to operate as an investment and trading platform. </p>
<h2>Binance&#8217;s Website And Services Blocked </h2>
<p>In its March 12 meeting, the SEC approved filing a formal request with the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) to assist in blocking Binance&#8217;s website and related web pages. </p>

<p>The SEC said Binance was offering investment and trading services without the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-implements-stricter-token-listing-procedure/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">required license</a> and allegedly posed a &#8220;threat&#8221; to the safety of Filipino investors&#8217; funds. SEC Chairman Emilio Aquino emphasized the importance of protecting the interests of investors in the request sent to the NTC. Aquino states:</p>
<blockquote><p>The SEC has identified the aforementioned platform and concluded that the public’s continued access to these websites/apps poses a threat to the security of the funds of investing  Filipinos.</p></blockquote>
<p>With an average <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-investigates-300m-bome-token-pre-listing/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">daily trading volume</a> of $65 billion and support for over 402 cryptocurrencies, Binance has gained a substantial user base of more than 183 million members in the Asian country, according to the regulator.</p>
<p>However, the SEC emphasized that Binance has not obtained the necessary license to solicit investments from the public or operate a securities exchange. Consequently, the SEC issued a public warning against investing in or using Binance&#8217;s services. </p>
<p>The commission has been actively exploring the possibility of blocking Binance&#8217;s website and online presence in the Philippines since November 2023. However, due to the “sizable operations” of Binance, the SEC has allowed sufficient time for investors to transition their portfolios toward authorized investment products and platforms.</p>
<h2>CommEX To Close Operations Following Binance Acquisition</h2>
<p>CommEX, the exchange that acquired Binance&#8217;s Russia business in September, has announced its decision to shut down. As per the company&#8217;s <a href="https://commex.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9278429425807-CommEX-Notice-of-Operation-Suspension" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">statement </a>on its website, the delisting process will commence on May 10, rendering users unable to access any content associated with the exchange. However, a series of steps will be implemented, leading to the closure.</p>
<p>Effective March 25, 2024, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-russian-exodus-did-key-players-shift-commex/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">CommEX </a>will stop new user registrations, asset transfers from Binance, and fiat and cryptocurrency deposit services. Then, on March 28, the exchange will stop opening positions for simple futures and futures trading and only allow users to close existing positions.</p>

<p>More changes will follow: Starting April 2, 2024, P2P services will prohibit merchants from creating new advertisements and prevent users from creating new orders; the system will automatically close existing P2P orders and advertising services.</p>
<p>Trading pairs for Simple Futures and Futures Trading will be delisted on April 18, prompting users to close all open positions to avoid automatic settlements. In addition, the<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/nigeria-detains-binances-crypto-crime-investigator/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> spot market</a> will be closed on April 23rd, automatically canceling all spot orders and disabling the Convert feature.</p>
<p>Finally, on May 10, 2024, the official website of CommEX will be delisted, resulting in the unavailability of any content related to the exchange.</p>

<title>Dogecoin Price Action: Why A 10% Drop Would Cost Traders $66 Million</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-10-drop-66-million/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-10-drop-66-million/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。Dogecoin价格下跌到0.15美元将导致6,600万美元的损失。目前价格维持在0.17美元以上，但如果下跌10%，将有许多交易者亏损。同时，如果价格上涨10%，将有大量做空交易者被清算。一些加密分析师预测Dogecoin价格将继续上涨，交易员对这一加密货币的未来持乐观态度。<br /> <div>
<h2 class="p2">Dogecoin Price Drop To $0.15 Would Wipe Out $66 Million</h2>
<p class="p2">The Dogecoin price is still holding steady above $0.17, but long traders face a threat if the price were to break down and retreat from here. According to <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/pro/futures/LiquidationMap" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">data</a> from Coinglass, there are a lot of traders who would lose money if the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-outperform-dogecoin/">DOGE price</a> were to fall 10% from its current level.</p>

<p class="p2">The liquidation heat map on the website shows that right above the $0.153 level, there is a lot of leveraged longs. A total of 2.43 million <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-outperform-dogecoin/">DOGE</a> in leveraged longs have their liquidation price at this point, and a drop below this price mark would lead to massive liquidations. In total, there are $66.89 million worth of longs at this level, and a 10% drop would trigger this liquidation trend.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Dogecoin liquidation map" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-289440 aligncenter" height="264" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-25-at-13.40.09.png?w=640&#038;resize=640%2C264" width="640" />Source: Coinglass</p>
<p class="p2">On the other end of the spectrum, there are a large number of leveraged shorts that will be liquidated if the price were to rise another 10% from here. Coinglass data shows that the liquidation volumes, if Dogecoin moves above $0.1908, would cross more than $55 million.</p>
<p class="p2">In the shorter term, short traders stand to suffer $20 million in liquidations if the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/big-money-eyes-dogecoin-whale-activity-explodes-600/">DOGE price</a> reaches $0.18. Whole long traders risk a similar amount if the price of the meme coin breaks down below $0.17.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Can DOGE Price Reclaim $0.2?</h2>
<p class="p2">The Dogecoin price continues to get a lot of support, and one of the most recent instances of this is the price surging when the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) announced that it had gotten a number of licenses for its money transmitter business.</p>

<p class="p2">Crypto analysts have also shown bullishness toward the meme coin, expecting the Dogecoin price to continue to rise. One such case is from crypto analyst DonAlt who <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-pundit-predicts-price-surge-for-dogecoin/">believes that the DOGE price could reach a new all-time high with a target at $1</a>.</p>
<p class="p2">DonAlt explains that the meme coin has being trading quite well alongside Bitcoin, so the possibility that it rallies towards $1 is high. The crypto analyst believes that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-surges-x-payments-secures-3-new-licenses/">DOGE</a> is a great investment and it would be a great buy if it does dip to $1 again.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Shatters Profit-Taking Streak From 2021 Bull Run</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-shatters-profit-taking-streak-2021-bull-run/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-shatters-profit-taking-streak-2021-bull-run/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章指出，在最近的比特币牛市中，连续卖出利润的日子已经超过了2021年疯狂涨势中的历史记录。BTC已经连续157天出现净利润带动。通过Net Realized Profit/Loss指标显示，投资者在连续157天内持续取得净利润。此外，BTC价格上涨并突破了69000美元水平。 <div>
<p>On-chain data shows the recent Bitcoin consecutive profit-taking day streak has now surpassed the longest run from the 2021 bull rally.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Has Now Seen 157 Straight Days Of Net Profit-Taking</h2>
<p>As analyst James Van Straten explained as a new <a href="https://twitter.com/jvs_btc/status/1772226408451875076" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, BTC has already surpassed the longest profit-taking spree from the previous bull run during this rally so far.</p>
<p>The relevant indicator here is the &#8220;<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-going-through-one-profit-taking-events-data/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Net Realized Profit/Loss</a>,&#8221; which tracks the net amount of profit or loss (in USD) that Bitcoin investors as a whole are realizing with their selling.</p>

<p>This metric works by going through the on-chain history of each sold coin to see what price it was moved at before this. Assuming that the last transaction of the coin was the last point at which it changed hands, the price at its time would have been its cost basis leading up to its latest sale.</p>
<p>The indicator then subtracts this price from the current spot price at which it&#8217;s being sold/transferred to calculate the realized profit or loss. Naturally, if this difference is positive, the coin&#8217;s sale is contributing to the profit-taking volume, while it being negative implies loss realization.</p>
<p>The Net Realized Profit/Loss sums up all these profits and losses for all the coins being sold at a given moment to output the overall situation in the market.</p>
<p>Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 7-day moving average (MA) of this Bitcoin indicator over the past few years:</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Net Realized Profit/Loss" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="1013" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GJg1wsVWQAEEwoU?format=jpg&amp;name=large" width="1800" /></p>

<p>As displayed in the above graph, the 7-day MA of the Bitcoin Net Realized Profit/Loss has been positive for the past few months. To be more particular, the indicator has held these values for 157 consecutive days now.</p>
<p>When this metric has green values, it means that the market as a whole is participating in a net amount of profit-taking. Similarly, red values imply the dominance of loss-taking.</p>
<p>It would appear that the investors have been taking net profit for 157 straight days now, which is longer than the longest profit-taking streak during the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-volume-79-lower-2021-bull-run-glassnode/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">2021 bull run</a> (155 days).</p>
<p>From the chart, it&#8217;s visible that Bitcoin Net Realized Profit/Loss shot especially high as the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price explored <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-breaks-through-69000-setting-new-record/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">new all-time highs</a> earlier. The price top so far coincided with the peak of this spike in the indicator, where its 7-day MA value hit $3.6 billion.</p>
<p>This profit-taking level was similar to the largest event observed during the last bull run. According to Straten, this is one of the reasons the asset has seen such a massive selloff.</p>

<p>Despite hitting record levels already, the profit-taking may not be ending anytime soon; however, as the analyst says, &#8220;this trend will continue as we are in a bull run and is still relatively mild compared to the 2021 bull run.&#8221;</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>Bullish momentum appears to have returned for Bitcoin as the cryptocurrency has surpassed the $69,000 level after a surge of more than 5% over the past day.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Stalls As Evening Star Forms: Can BTC Bulls Still Shine?</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-evening-star-btc-bulls-still-shine/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-evening-star-btc-bulls-still-shine/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。文章讨论了Bitcoin CME期货月度图表上的“Evening Star”蜡烛图形式可能预示着比特币上升趋势的结束。虽然分析师指出这可能意味着比特币将在接下来的两个季度内达到峰值，但也提出了一些技术分析带来的挑战。此外，尽管比特币最近有所反弹，但目前仍处于熊市突破形态，需要突破70,000美元才能继续上涨。文章还提到了从spot比特币ETF中的流出现象，这可能对市场施加卖压。 <div>
<p>Tony &#8220;The Bull&#8221; Severino, the Head of Research at NewsBTC and a certified CME, has <a href="https://twitter.com/tonythebullBTC/status/1772234677207625779" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">identified</a><a href="https://twitter.com/tonythebullBTC/status/1772234677207625779" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> </a>an &#8220;Evening Star&#8221; candlestick pattern on the monthly chart of the Bitcoin CME futures. This formation, which traditionally indicates a potential trend reversal, is forming at a critical point for Bitcoin. </p>
<p>According to Severino, there could be tell-tale signs suggesting that the Bitcoin upswing could end as the momentum fades.</p>
<h2>The Evening Star Formation: BTC Bull Run Over?</h2>
<p>Though there are concerns that the pattern is forming on the Bitcoin CME futures chart, it is absent from the spot BTCUSD chart on ordinary charts from Binance or Coinbase, for example. Accordingly, the lack of uniformity on charts has also left Severino questioning the reliability of the signal. </p>

<p>While the Evening Star pattern suggests a possible reversal, Severino cautions that Bitcoin could still reach higher highs in the coming months before peaking and reversing. However, the analyst stresses that predicting the exact timing of these events is a challenge. </p>
<p>Based on candlestick analysis, Severino predicts that Bitcoin could peak within the next two quarters, possibly in mid- or late Q3 2024. </p>
<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/x/EU4owKnQ/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Bitcoin price trending upward on the daily chart | Source: BTCUSDT on Binance, TradingView" class="size-full" height="904" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/EU4owKnQ/" width="1787" /></a>
<p>When writing, Bitcoin is trading at around all-time highs. Following the cool-off of last week, the coin bounced back strongly over the weekend, wiping out some losses. The coin is technically within a bearish breakout formation, trading below the 20-day moving average, clear in the daily chart.</p>
<p>For the uptrend to continue and extend from the formation in the daily chart, BTC must push above $70,000. The validity of this uptrend will be solid if the leg up is with expanding trading volume. </p>

<p>Severino also notes that the leg up will be valid and the Evening Star formation invalid if there is a strong close above $74,000 by the end of the month. Bitcoin prices peaked at around $73,800 in early March, buoyed by expanding demand, especially from spot Bitcoin ETFs.</p>
<h2>Spot Bitcoin ETFs Post More Outflows</h2>
<p>Despite the potential for a continued rally, some fundamental factors pose challenges. Notably, outflows from spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), particularly from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), are rising. Rumors suggest that bankrupt crypto lender <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/genesis-face-21-million-penalty-sec-charges-settled/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Genesis</a> could be liquidating its GBTC holdings, adding further selling pressure to the market.</p>
<img alt="Outflows from spot BTC ETF issuers | Source: Lookonchain data" class="size-full wp-image-289501" height="768" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GJSkwmTacAAmJM3.png?resize=1024%2C768" width="1024" />
<p> By March 22, spot Bitcoin ETF issuers had experienced <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1771221747318075748" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">outflows</a> for five straight days, according to Lookonchain data. Nonetheless, as GBTC posts outflows, BlackRock&#8217;s IBIT continues attracting more clients seeking BTC exposure.</p>

<title>Large Shiba Inu Transactions Spark Fears Of A Massive Dumping Spree</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-transactions-spree/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-transactions-spree/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。Shiba Inu的鲸鱼已经在过去24小时内进行了大笔交易，引发了市场担忧。这些交易包括将数十亿SHIB代币转移到不同钱包，并将一些代币转移到Coinbase和Robinhood等交易平台。这可能表明鲸鱼可能计划在市场上抛售他们的持仓，对SHIB价格造成巨大影响。然而，一些投资者可能只是利用最近价格下跌的机会进行积累，因为预计SHIB还有更多上行趋势。当前SHIB价格为$0.00002771，在过去24小时内下跌近1%。 <div>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-pepe-whales-sold/">Shiba Inu (SHIB) whales</a> look to be at it again following large transactions involving the meme token in the last 24 hours. As expected, these transactions have raised concerns that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-23-5-million-shiba-inu/">crypto investors</a> might be looking to offload their tokens on the market. </p>
<h2>Shiba Inu Whales Move Billions Of SHIB</h2>
<p><a href="https://etherscan.io/advanced-filter?tkn=0x95aD61b0a150d79219dCF64E1E6Cc01f0B64C4cE&amp;txntype=2&amp;__cf_chl_rt_tk=.f2yRaOf1TUS7udrjffik62iaeQ_18gwUWkSmNcTtu4-1711353862-0.0.1.1-1471" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">On-chain data</a> shows that Shiba Inu whales moved billions of SHIB in different transactions. In one transaction, 77.2 billion SHIB tokens were moved to a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/coinbase-support-bitcoin-developer-with-3-6-million/">Coinbase wallet</a>. Meanwhile, over 205 billion SHIB tokens were moved across different wallets, some of which were transferred to a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-gets-boost-robinhood-wallet/">Robinhood wallet</a>. </p>

<p>The transfer of some of these tokens to crypto trading platforms, Coinbase and Robinhood, has raised suspicions that these Shiba Inu whales might be planning to sell off their holdings to make some profits. If so, it could massively impact the meme coin’s price due to the magnitude of such transactions. </p>
<p>The SHIB community has seen several smart traders, including MakerDAO founder Rune Christensen, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-whale-dumps-substantial-holdings-on-the-market-heres-how-much/">take profits</a> over the past few weeks. This also contributed to the concern that these recent transactions might involve more whales who want to secure their profits. </p>
<p>However, while the possibility of a sell-off exists, this could be just investors using the recent price dip as an opportunity to <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-whales-shib/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">accumulate more</a> of the meme coin. SHIB experienced a significant price surge, which saw it climb to become the tenth-largest crypto token by market cap. However, it has dropped out of the top 10 after its recent price decline.</p>
<p>The theory of SHIB accumulation looks plausible considering that more upward trend is expected for the crypto token. Therefore, investors will still be looking to position themselves ahead of this bull run, which could see the meme coin <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-dogecoin-shib-excitement/">break its all-time high (ATH)</a>. </p>
<h2>Shiba Inu Still Has Bullish Momentum</h2>
<p>SHIB may be ready for another upward movement if the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-whale-dumps-substantial-holdings-on-the-market-heres-how-much/">wave of profit-taking</a> by investors is now over. Crypto analyst Xanrox <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-whale-dumps-substantial-holdings-on-the-market-heres-how-much/">suggested</a> that the meme coin could hit a new ATH by July, which means more parabolic price moves are to be expected if this price prediction is to be realized by then. </p>

<p>SHIB’s fundamentals also suggest that it is only a matter of time before the upward trend continues. The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-latest-shib-magazine/">Shiba Inu team</a> continues to develop innovations that can help propel SHIB’s price. Meanwhile, although Shibarium’s daily transactions continue to decline, they are likely to pick up at some point, with a massive increase in <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-burns-bright-shib/">SHIB burns</a> expected once that happens. </p>
<p>At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.00002771, down almost 1% in the last 24 hours, according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/shiba-inu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">data</a> from CoinMarketCap. </p>

<title>Crypto Shockwave: Nearly $1 Billion Vanishes From Global Funds In Historic Outflow</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-shock-nearly-billion-vanishes-global-funds/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-shock-nearly-billion-vanishes-global-funds/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。全球加密货币基金经历了近10亿美元的净流出，打破了7周的资金流入纪录。这次规模达到约9.42亿美元的流出是相当显着的，几乎是1月底观察到的5亿美元的先前记录的两倍。主要资产管理公司遭受了撤资风暴，影响了加密货币投资产品领域的交易量和资产估值。此外，不同国家的加密货币基金也出现了资金流动情况，表明全球投资者情绪复杂。此外，大规模撤资还引发了行业领导者之间对比特币ETF在加强市场整合方面的作用和可访问性的讨论。 <div>
<p>Last week, the crypto investment landscape <a href="https://blog.coinshares.com/volume-175-digital-asset-fund-flows-weekly-report-6af2a10c0b30" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">witnessed</a> a significant exodus of capital from global crypto funds. A recent report from CoinShares highlighted nearly $1 billion net outflow from these funds, marking a historic departure from a 7-week inflow streak that had cumulatively amassed $12.3 billion.</p>
<h2>A Closer Look At The Outflows</h2>
<p>The magnitude of these outflows at roughly $942 million is particularly notable, almost doubling the previous record of $500 million witnessed towards the end of January.</p>

<p>Major players in the asset management space, including BlackRock, Bitwise, Fidelity, Grayscale, ProShares, and 21Shares, felt the brunt of this wave of withdrawals, according to CoinShares.</p>
<p>The timing of these outflows coincided with a notable correction in the prices of underlying <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/iceland-prioritizes-food-over-crypto-mining/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">cryptocurrencies</a>, which erased $10 billion from the fund&#8217;s assets under management (AUM). However, the combined AUM of $88 billion still hovers above prior cycle highs.</p>
<p>Notably, these outflows have pronounced impacted trading volumes and asset valuations within the crypto investment product sector. Last week&#8217;s trading volume plummeted by a third to $28 billion amidst a price correction that significantly diminished the AUM of these funds.</p>
<p>The US market, particularly new <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/spot-bitcoin-etf-noobs-panic-selling/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">spot Bitcoin ETFs</a>, witnessed over $1 billion in inflows, which were insufficient to offset the nearly $2 billion <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/back-to-back-negative-bitcoin-etf-flows/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">outflows from Grayscale&#8217;s GBTC fund</a> conversion.</p>
<p>According to CoinShares Head of Research James Butterfill, the &#8220;recent price correction&#8221; resulted in &#8220;hesitancy from investors, leading to much lower inflows into new ETF issuers in the US, which saw US$1.1bn inflows, partially offsetting incumbent Grayscale’s significant US$2bn outflows last week.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Global Crypto Sentiment And Market Responses</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, last week&#8217;s sentiment was not solely concentrated on US-based funds or Bitcoin. Investment products in Sweden, Hong Kong, Switzerland, and Germany also experienced outflows, though Brazil and Canada-based funds recorded inflows, showcasing a mixed global investor sentiment.</p>
<img alt="Crypto asset flows by country." class="wp-image-289492 size-large" height="582" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-25-at-14.57.15.png?resize=980%2C582" width="980" />
<p>Additionally, Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano-based products faced outflows, underscoring the broad impact of the market&#8217;s downturn. In contrast, other altcoin funds like Polkadot, Avalanche, and Litecoin saw net inflows, indicating selective investor interest in the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/doge-ada-cardano-altcoin-season/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">altcoin sector</a>.</p>
<img alt="Crypto asset flows." class="wp-image-289495 size-large" height="644" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-25-at-15.02.47.png?resize=980%2C644" width="980" />
<p>This period of market recalibration has also sparked a dialogue among industry leaders about the role and accessibility of Bitcoin ETFs in fostering broader market integration.</p>
<p>Bivu Das of Kraken UK and Daniel Seifert of Coinbase UK have both <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etf-buzz-in-uk-kraken-executive-pushes-for-market-access/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">advocated for the UK market&#8217;s access to Bitcoin ETFs</a>, citing the importance of such investment products in establishing a comprehensive crypto ecosystem.</p>

<p>As reported, by offering indirect exposure to Bitcoin&#8217;s price movements, these instruments propose a regulated and possibly more accessible avenue for investors, contributing to the diversification and maturity of the investment landscape in the digital currency market.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">ICYMI: Kraken UK Managing Director Bivu Das says he&#8217;d &#8220;absolutely&#8221; like to see a <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#Bitcoin</a> ETF in the UK, providing regulated access to crypto exposure currently lacking and boost UK&#8217;s crypto hub ambitions, and legitimize bitcoin for institutions.</p>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。Terraform Labs面临高额赔偿金额的审判，涉及其TerraUSD在2022年崩溃所导致的欺诈指控。共同创始人Do Kwon因面临美国和韩国的刑事指控而在黑山等待引渡决定。美国证券交易委员会（SEC）提出的欺诈指控包括虚假声称Terraform的区块链技术被韩国支付应用Chai使用，以及关于TerraUSD稳定性的误导性宣称。庭审将听取关键证人和爆料者的证词，包括涉及芝加哥交易公司Jump Trading的指控。 <div>
<p>Terraform Labs is set to face a high-stakes trial on Monday, grappling with civil fraud allegations linked to the collapse of its <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/terraform-labs-accuses-sec-of-government-overreach/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">TerraUSD stablecoin</a> in 2022. Meanwhile, Terra co-founder Do Kwon remains in Montenegro awaiting the decision on whether he will be extradited to the United States or South Korea to face criminal charges. </p>
<h2>Terraform Labs Faces Trial Over $40 Billion TerraUSD Collapse</h2>
<p>The civil case against Terraform Labs centers on fraud allegations brought forth by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), stemming from the collapse of TerraUSD, which resulted in the loss of approximately $40 billion in investor assets. </p>
<p>According to a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-25/terraform-goes-on-trial-as-kwon-awaits-extradition-in-montenegro" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, the trial will see a Manhattan jury deliberating the fraud claims, examining the SEC&#8217;s allegations regarding Terraform Labs&#8217; “deceitful practices.” </p>

<p>While the trial unfolds, Do Kwon finds himself caught in the Montenegro justice system, awaiting the crucial decision on his <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/do-kwon-released-from-prison-remanded-to-montenegro/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">extradition</a>. Having faced criminal charges in both the US and South Korea, Kwon&#8217;s release from a Montenegro prison on Saturday was accompanied by the country&#8217;s Supreme Court reviewing earlier court rulings regarding his potential extradition to South Korea. </p>
<p>The circumstances surrounding Kwon&#8217;s extradition challenge SEC enforcers, as civil suits typically take a back seat to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/terraform-labs-166m-payment-under-sec-investigation/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">criminal proceedings</a>. Until Kwon is in the US, a criminal trial cannot occur.</p>
<p>In light of these developments, the SEC is seeking a court order to enjoin Terraform Labs and Do Kwon from future violations of US securities laws. In addition, the SEC is seeking <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/montenegro-orders-do-kwon-extradition-to-s-korea/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">civil penalties</a> and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains. </p>
<p>The regulatory authority claims that Terraform Labs defrauded investors by falsely asserting that the popular Korean payment app, Chai, utilized Terraform&#8217;s blockchain technology for processing and settling cryptocurrency transactions. </p>
<p>The SEC further alleges that investors were misled about the stability of TerraUSD, which was purportedly algorithmically &#8220;pegged&#8221; to the US dollar. Terraform Labs strongly denies these allegations, criticizing the SEC&#8217;s characterization of cryptocurrency companies as “lawless.”</p>
<h2>Whistleblowers And Key Witnesses Take The Stand</h2>
<p>Having filed for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/terraform-labs-files-for-bankruptcy-in-the-us/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection</a> in January, Terraform Labs argued it could not pay the penalties sought by federal regulators. Do Kwon, who owns approximately 92% of the company&#8217;s equity, faces the daunting task of navigating these legal battles while Terraform Labs&#8217; fate hangs in the balance. </p>
<p>US District Judge Jed Rakoff, who is presiding over the civil case, ruled in December that Terraform is liable for selling &#8220;unregistered securities.&#8221; This is in line with the SEC&#8217;s hinting that cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin (BTC) are “securities” under the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/terraform-labs-sec-wins-trial-date-january-2024/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Howey test</a>, which many pro-crypto advocates and companies believe is an &#8220;outdated set of rules and laws.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, Terraform maintains that its cryptocurrencies do not fall under the definition of securities, disputes the SEC&#8217;s jurisdiction, and intends to appeal the ruling.</p>

<p>During the trial, the jury is expected to hear evidence regarding the involvement of Jump Trading, a Chicago-based trading firm alleged to have entered into a “secretive arrangement” with Terraform Labs to support TerraUSD before its collapse. </p>
<p>According to Bloomberg, the SEC will allegedly present text messages between Terraform executives discussing the &#8220;depeg,&#8221; where TerraUSD lost its peg to the US dollar in May 2021. </p>
<p>Key witnesses include alleged whistleblowers, a Jump Trading executive, and the chief product officer at the Chai payment app, who aim to demonstrate Terraform and Kwon&#8217;s intentional deception. It is anticipated that Bill DiSomma, co-founder of Jump Trading, will also testify.</p>

<title>Here’s Why The Dogecoin Price Surged Over The Weekend</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-price-surged-weekend/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-price-surged-weekend/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的<br />加密货币 Dogecoin 最近经历了价格价值的指数增长，其价格上涨了35%。据报道，这一增长与 Elon Musk 的支付子公司 X Payment LLC 的最新发展有关，后者成功扩展了在墨西哥、俄勒冈和伊利诺伊州的运营能力。此外，有报道称 DOGE 已经被整合到一家商店，并且 X Payments 可能会将其作为首选支付方式。 DOGE 鲸鱼正在行动，一名投资者近期以 3.75 百万美元购买了 2500 万 DOGE 代币，这也与 X Payments 的扩张努力相吻合，暗示市场情绪可能出现转变。如果 Dogecoin 在 X Payments 中作为支付货币整合，该加密货币可能会吸引更多鲸鱼和新投资者。 <div>
<p>Popular doggy-themed cryptocurrency, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-when-dogecoin-does-this/">Dogecoin,</a> has recently experienced an exponential surge in its price value. Despite its previously <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-growth-holder-activity/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">sluggish price momentum</a>, Dogecoin witnessed a massive $800 million increase in open interest over the weekend. Interestingly, a recent development indicates that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/elon-musk-makes-another-cryptic-tweet/">Elon Musk</a>’s X Payment LLC has greatly contributed to this price pump. </p>
<h2>Why Dogecoin Price Rose 35%</h2>
<p>Over the past 72 hours, the price of Dogecoin witnessed a 35% increase in its value, recording an impressive weekly high of $0.17 on Saturday.  According to <a href="https://app.santiment.net/projects/dogecoin" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">data</a> from Santiment, a crypto analytics platform, the cryptocurrency has also witnessed a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-open-interest-record-2/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">significant rise in open interest</a>, skyrocketing by a remarkable $800 million in value. </p>

<p>This <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-surges-x-payments-secures-3-new-licenses/">massive price surge</a> has been attributed to a recent development in Elon Musk’s payment subsidiary, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/x-payment-integration-dogecoin-included/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">X Payments LLC</a>. According to reports, X Payments has successfully expanded its operational capabilities to three new states. The platform has secured money transmitter licenses in Mexico, Oregon and Illinois.</p>
<p>Following the disclosure of this news, the sentiment surrounding Dogecoin had transformed, as <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/x-payments-dogecoin-integration/">speculations</a> about the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-outperform-dogecoin/">meme coin</a> potentially becoming a preferred payment method for the X Payments began to spread like wildfire. At the time of writing the cryptocurrency is trading at $0.172, reflecting a 14.27% price increase over the past seven days, according to CoinMarketCap. </p>
<p>Interestingly, Dogecoin has already been integrated as a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-gains-momentum-as-musk-hints-at-future-tesla-payments-is-doge-going-to-the-moon/">payment method within Musk’s Tesla</a> merchandise store. In 2023, the SpaceX CEO also teased about the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-x-peer-to-peer-payments/">possibility of DOGE payments on X</a> (formerly Twitter), pushing the broader crypto community on edge as they anticipated the potential inclusion of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/elon-musk-tesla-dogecoin/">DOGE in the payments ecosystem.</a> </p>
<p>Presently, as X Payments expands its services and possibly prepares for a launch, speculations are growing stronger, driving up <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/doge/dogecoin-price-support-0-1220/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dogecoin’s price</a> amidst the rising interest in the cryptocurrency’s potential integration with X Payments.</p>
<h2>DOGE Whales On The Move</h2>
<p>A recent <a href="https://x.com/ali_charts/status/1770798858718560581?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a> has revealed that an <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/big-money-eyes-dogecoin-whale-activity-explodes-600/">anonymous Whale</a> made a substantial purchase of 25 million DOGE tokens, valued at $3.75 million, within the last 72 hours. The timing of this acquisition is particularly noteworthy as it aligns with the recent rise in Dogecoin’s price and open interest over the weekend. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-whales-buying-spree/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Whale’s purchase</a> also coincides with X Payments expansion efforts into new regions, suggesting a potential shift in market sentiment as investors are now showing an <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-open-interest-record/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">elevated interest in DOGE</a>. If Dogecoin becomes integrated as a payment currency within X Payments, the cryptocurrency could witness a significant boost in adoption, potentially attracting more whales and new investors and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-pundit-predicts-price-surge-for-dogecoin/">triggering a substantial price surge.</a></p>

<title>Elon Musk Queries Why Ethereum Founder Buterin Left X</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/elon-musk-queries-ethereum-founder-buterin/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/elon-musk-queries-ethereum-founder-buterin/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章讨论了Ethereum创始人Buterin避开X平台的问题，引起了社区的广泛讨论。Elon Musk和Autism Capital都对此表示关注，指出Buterin较少参与X可能与该平台上的灌水问题有关。但尽管如此，Buterin仍致力于推动Ethereum的技术发展，并支持Farcaster这样与他的去中心化愿景相符的平台。<br />ETH价格目前为3490美元，处于潜在上涨的状态。 <div>
<p>Elon Musk, the tech magnate behind SpaceX and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/elon-musk-tesla-dogecoin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Tesla</a>, has raised questions about Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin&#8217;s apparent retreat from X, the platform Musk acquired in 2022 for $44 billion. The conversation was sparked by a post from &#8220;Autism Capital,&#8221; a crypto influencer with significant clout in the crypto dialogue, who lamented Buterin&#8217;s reduced engagement on X, advocating for its potential to significantly uplift Ethereum&#8217;s presence.</p>
<h2>Why Is The Ethereum Founder Avoiding X?</h2>
<p>“Vitalik needs to get back on X. Farcaster isn’t going to win the culture war. If he wants Ethereum to shine he should engage more on this platform, not sequester himself with his chosen peers on an island. He will have far more impact if he engages the bigger community here,” Autism Capital <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1772172698195526057" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">stated</a>.</p>

<p>Musk&#8217;s straightforward inquiry, &#8220;Why did he leave?&#8221; posed on the platform, has since unleashed a broad spectrum of conjectures and insights from the cryptocurrency community. In the heart of the ensuing conversation, the issue of rampant <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/elon-musk-x-bots-dogecoin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">bot activity</a> on X was flagged as a potential deterrent for Buterin.</p>
<p>A poignant observation was made by a user referencing Tyler John&#8217;s analysis, who <a href="https://twitter.com/tyler_m_john/status/1749025877063606684?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">detailed</a> the spamming issue for the ETH co-founder: “Vitalik Buterin has to append every reply with &#8220;srry 4 ratio-ing&#8221; because immediately afterwards a deluge of sycophants, crypto bots, and followers rains down on the post with tickers, memes, and expressions of praise and all the OP can see is #ETH and $SOL for three days.”</p>
<p>Buterin responded to this in January, stating, “This is (part of) why I do most of my tweeting on farcaster these days srry 4 ratio-ing.”</p>

<p>In the midst of these discussions, Buterin&#8217;s recent <a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">activity on X,</a> albeit limited, remains focused on promoting Ethereum&#8217;s technological strides. Prior to the conversation initiated by Musk and Autism Capital, Buterin highlighted the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), emphasizing its potential to eliminate vulnerabilities like multi-sig backdoors, reflecting his ongoing commitment to the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-buterin-plans-major-changes/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ethereum project</a> despite his sparse presence on X.</p>
<p>However, Buterin&#8217;s advocacy for Farcaster over X is notable. He has praised Farcaster for its decentralized nature and innovative features, such as the channel feature, which he believes offers a superior social media experience. &#8220;Farcaster’s channel feature makes it a better social media platform than X,&#8221; Buterin has stated, illustrating his support for platforms that align with his vision for a decentralized, user-empowered digital ecosystem.</p>
<p>At press time, Ethereum (ETH) price stood at $3,490. In the weekly chart, ETH held above the 0.618 Fib ($3.398), confirming the potential for further upside.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Diamond Hands Weaken As HODLers Sell 669,000 BTC</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-diamond-hands-broken-hodlers-669000-btc/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-diamond-hands-broken-hodlers-669000-btc/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。根据文章的内容，最近一个月比特币的长期持有者已经转移了669,000 BTC。这些持币者通常不轻易出售，但最近的数据显示他们在过去的一个月里大笔出售。这可能与最近的大型事件和价格波动有关。然而，与过去的牛市相比，他们的分发量还不算很大。当前比特币价格已向$67,000水平反弹。 <div>
<p>On-chain data shows the Bitcoin long-term holders, or so-called &#8220;diamond hands,&#8221; have transferred a total of 669,000 BTC over the past month.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Have Sold Big In Past 30 Days</h2>
<p>As explained by CryptoQuant Netherlands community manager Maartunn in a <a href="https://twitter.com/JA_Maartun/status/1772160996901048420" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, the Bitcoin network has observed multiple transactions involving a large amount of dormant coins.</p>
<p>Transfers involving old coins are attributed to the &#8220;<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/hodling-steady-bitcoin-long-term-holder-supply-ath/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">long-term holder</a>&#8221; (LTH) cohort. The LTHs refer to the BTC investors who have been holding onto their coins since more than 155 days ago.</p>

<p>Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell or transfer the tokens at any point. As such, the LTHs are considered the more resolute part of the market.</p>
<p>These HODLers don&#8217;t easily sell due to this strong conviction and swiftly ride past both periods of downtrends and uptrends. The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-short-term-holders-4-5-profits-nov-2021/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">short-term holders</a> (STHs), who make up for the rest of the sector, are the ones who make panic moves during such periods.</p>
<p>As the LTHs don&#8217;t often sell, the times that they do participate in distribution can be all the more note-worthy. One way to track whether these holders are selling or not is through their 30-day &#8220;net position change,&#8221; which is a metric that keeps track of the net amount exiting or entering the cohort.</p>
<p>Below is the chart shared by Maartunn that reveals the trend in this Bitcoin indicator over the history of the cryptocurrency:</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Long-Term Holder Netflow" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="2580" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GJf7BpAX0AA7d2H?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096" width="4096" /></p>

<p>As displayed in the above graph, the 30-day net position change of the Bitcoin LTHs has assumed a deep red value recently. In the past month, these HODLers have removed 669,000 BTC from their wallets.</p>
<p>Something to keep in mind is that when it comes to accumulation, the net position change has a delay attached to it. This is because the LTH supply only increases 155 days after the purchase has been made, since the newly bought coins have to first mature enough to be a part of this age group.</p>
<p>In the case of distribution, though, the same is obviously not true, since any coins that get transferred on the blockchain have their age reset back to zero instantly.</p>
<p>The recent negative net position spike for the LTHs is quite big. To put things into perspective, the BTC amount that these diamond hands have transacted with this spike is equal to around $44.7 billion in the US Dollar, a staggering value.</p>
<p>It would seem that the latest events of the cryptocurrency, which have included a brand <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-breaks-through-69000-setting-new-record/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">new all-time high (ATH)</a> and a crash, have forced even these diamond hands to break their streak.</p>
<p>From the chart, it&#8217;s visible that the LTHs have sold big when new Bitcoin ATHs have been set in the past bull rallies as well. Interestingly, though, the peak of these spikes has only coincided with a price top partway through each run, and not the actual cycle peak.</p>

<p>In BTC-scale, the negative 30-day net position spike from the LTHs has been smaller this time than both that observed during the 2017 and 2021 bull runs. This is only the case so far, however, as it&#8217;s unclear whether the peak LTH net distribution has ended or not.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>Bitcoin has been making another attempt at recovery during the past few days as its price has now surged back towards the $67,000 level.</p>

<title>XRP Ledger’s Shiny New AMM Runs Into Problems – Here’s What We Know</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-ledger-amm-problems/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-ledger-amm-problems/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章介绍了XRP Ledger（XRPL）新的AMM在推出后遭遇到的一个意外bug。XRPL开发人员发现了系统中的各种不一致之处，导致了问题的出现。开发人员呼吁修复bug，并强调了需要加强测试程序，以及引入Canary Network来增强AMM的稳定性。WietseWind开发人员呼吁建立Canary Network来改善AMM，并提出了这一解决方案的优势。 <div>
<p>Following the <a href="https://x.com/ripplexdev/status/1771271093468193241?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official launch</a> of XRP Ledger’s (XRPL) <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/ripple-amms-to-xrpl-xrp-price/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Automated Market Maker (AMM)</a>, XLS-30, on March 22, developers unearthed various discrepancies linked to a system bug. As a result, an XRPL developer has called for a fix, highlighting the need for enhanced testing procedures and the incorporation of a Canary Network to bolster the AMM’s stability. </p>
<h2>XRPL’s New AMM Encounters Unexpected Bug</h2>
<p>On March 24, the RippleX development team <a href="https://x.com/ripplexdev/status/1771680918895558913?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">unveiled</a> a technical glitch in its newly launched AMM. The revelation comes as a <a href="https://x.com/maria06801698/status/1771969474310127774?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">surprise</a> to the general XRPL community, as they had been eagerly waiting for the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-not-bank-stablecoin-post-amm/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">protocol to roll out</a>. </p>

<p>According to the official statement released by the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-releases-amm-devnet-unlocks-defi-potential/">RippleX team</a>, the technical glitch surfaced as a result of multiple discrepancies identified in several <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/ripple-cto-amm-xrp-income/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AMM pools</a>. Upon investigation, the team revealed that the inconsistencies had “affected how the DEX payment engine routes liquidity through the AMM pools and order books.”</p>
<p>Addressing the issue, the development team has assured users that the engineering team were working diligently to resolve the bug issue and restore normal operation in the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-cto-breaks-down-the-amm-feature/">AMM</a>. Additionally, they have advised users to remain cautious and avoid depositing new funds into the AMM pools until the dilemma has been rectified.</p>
<p>Despite the temporary setback, optimism remains in the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/primary-threat-to-xrp-ledger-uncovered/">XRPL</a> community, with many <a href="https://x.com/gootecks/status/1771974042817528258?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">expressing</a> confidence in the development team’s ability to swiftly address the issue. The RippleX team has also <a href="https://x.com/ripplexdev/status/1771961354297241930?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">stated</a> that it has begun reviewing several proposed fixes for the AMM glitch, highlighting that the proposals will have to go through an amendment voting process before any solution is implemented.  </p>
<h2>XRPL Dev Calls For Canary Network</h2>
<p>In response to the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-xrp-ledger-amm-launch-not-affected/">technical challenges </a>faced by XRPL’s new AMM, WietseWind, one of the developers of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-ledger-foundation-ripplex-governance-overhaul/">XRP Ledger</a> has <a href="https://x.com/wietsewind/status/1771998717832278162?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">proposed</a> a long-term solution that could potentially ensure a more stable protocol. According to the developer, the discovery of a bug in the newly <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/coreum-founder-teases-gains-for-xrp-users-with-amm/">launched AMM</a> is evidence of the fragility of the protocol, emphasizing a lack of proper testing before launch.</p>

<p>WietseWind has stated the need for the development of a Canary Network to enhance and improve the AMM. He revealed that the Canary Network will have to be separate from the AMM, while also offering a native asset of some value so individuals can use it for real-life scenarios.</p>
<p>The developer has disclosed that the Canary Network would enable better testing with real value on a network that is not the mainnet. Additionally, it would be an inclusive network for the developers, projects, and everyone within the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrps-underperformance-ruffles-feathers-as-community-asks-ripple-to-do-something-about-price/">XRPL community.</a></p>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的<br />比特币ETF的流出以及美国通胀数据都将影响市场动态。比特币ETF的资金流入对市场情绪至关重要。美国即将发布的个人消费支出指数（PCE指数）可能影响美联储的货币政策。同时，狗狗币将推出期货交易，而Aptos和Fantom网络也有重大发展。Ondo Finance在RWA领域获得成功。BTC目前的交易价格为66,967美元。 <div>
<p>The crypto space is bracing for another eventful week, marked by several key developments and coins that are poised to influence market dynamics. So, here’s what investors and enthusiasts should be on the lookout for.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin: A Watchful Eye On Spot ETF Outflows</h2>
<p>Bitcoin remains at the forefront of investor attention, with the spotlight intensifying on the movements within spot Bitcoin ETFs. After experiencing an unprecedented <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-reclaims-66000-despite-4-day-etf-outflow-streak/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">streak</a> of five consecutive days of net negative flows—a first since their inception on January 11—the market is keenly awaiting a potential turnaround.</p>

<h2>US Inflation Data: The PCE Index</h2>
<p>The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Index, set for release this Friday, could have a significant impact on the market. The PCE Index, particularly its core component that excludes food and energy, is the Federal Reserve&#8217;s preferred inflation measure. It offers a broad view of the inflationary pressures within the economy, influencing monetary policy decisions.</p>

<p>The upcoming release, expected to show year-over-year core PCE at 2.8%(last 2.8%) and month-over-month at 0.3% (last 0.4%), holds weight in the Fed&#8217;s interest rate trajectory. Given the Fed&#8217;s pause on rate cuts, the market is keenly observing this data for signals on future monetary policy, especially with Fed Chair Jerome Powell&#8217;s insights anticipated at the end of the week (Friday).</p>
<p>This <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-btc-leading-indicator-cpi-inflation/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">inflation data</a> not only affects traditional finance but could also sway crypto markets, as Bitcoin and other digital assets have increasingly reacted to macroeconomic indicators in recent weeks.</p>
Dogecoin: Futures Trading And &#8216;Doge Day&#8217;
<p>Dogecoin is taking a significant leap forward with Coinbase International&#8217;s announcement of launching DOGE futures trading starting April 1. Coinbase officially <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-surges-x-payments-secures-3-new-licenses/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">announced</a> on Thursday last week, “Coinbase Derivatives will launch the first leveraged and CFTC-regulated futures contracts for Bitcoin Cash, Dogecoin, and Litecoin in April!”</p>
<p>Futures trading for cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin allows investors to speculate on the future price of DOGE without holding the actual cryptocurrency. This can increase liquidity and volatility but also introduce a mechanism for price discovery and hedging against price movements. Coinbase Derivatives&#8217; decision to offer these contracts could attract a new class of investors and traders to Dogecoin, potentially increasing its volatility.</p>
Aptos: Anticipation Of Major Announcements
<p>The Aptos network is on the cusp of potentially game-changing announcements, with speculation about partnerships with major asset managers like <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-private-bitcoin-event/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">BlackRock</a> or Franklin Templeton. The forthcoming &#8216;Aptos DeFi DAYS&#8217; event in Hong Kong from April 2 to 5 could serve as the stage for these revelations, with significant implications for the network&#8217;s valuation and strategic positioning in the DeFi space.</p>
<p>“Aptos is poised for a significant RWA announcement in April. Potential partnership rumors with a major asset manager. (BlackRock/Franklin Templeton) I anticipate that details will be revealed at the &#8216;Aptos DeFi DAYS&#8217; event on April 2”,” research firm Layergg <a href="https://twitter.com/layerggofficial/status/1771797316279980134" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">remarked</a> via X.</p>
Fantom: The Sonic Mainnet Launch
<p>The Fantom Foundation is on the verge of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/fantom-ftm-jumps-180-4-weeks-just-the-beginning/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">launching</a> the Sonic mainnet, a major technological advancement that promises to significantly enhance the blockchain&#8217;s performance and scalability. This upgrade is not just an incremental update but a comprehensive overhaul of Fantom&#8217;s infrastructure, aiming to address some of the most pressing challenges in the blockchain and decentralized application (dApp) ecosystem.</p>

<p>At the heart of the Sonic upgrade is the Fantom Virtual Machine (FVM), a newly developed engine designed to dramatically increase transaction speed and efficiency. This is complemented by the Carmen Database, a breakthrough in data storage that promises to reduce storage requirements by up to 90%. Moreover, the upgrade includes an optimized version of the Lachesis Consensus mechanism, further enhancing the blockchain&#8217;s performance.</p>
<p>These innovations collectively aim to propel Fantom&#8217;s transaction capacity to over 2,000 transactions per second, marking a significant leap towards solving scalability issues that have long plagued blockchain platforms. Scheduled for launch in spring 2024, the Sonic Mainnet could further bolster the Fantom (FTM) price prior to the official release.</p>
Ondo Finance: Riding The Crypto Wave Of RWA
<p>Ondo Finance is the best-performing crypto asset in the top 100 by market cap in the last seven days, with a staggering 93.5% increase in price, following BlackRock&#8217;s announcement of a $100M tokenized asset to fund. As RWA becomes a focal point in the crypto narrative, Ondo Finance&#8217;s association with BlackRock places it at the heart of this burgeoning trend, highlighting the growing intersection between traditional finance and blockchain technology.</p>
<p>“Ondo Finance is the RWA project most associated with BlackRock at this point and Real World Assets (RWA) could be the next major trend in crypto. They are also mentioned as a key project in Bitwise&#8217;s ‘Crypto Use Case 2024’ report,” research firm Layergg stated via X.</p>
<p>At press time, BTC traded at $66,967.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Buying Spree: Robert Kiyosaki Set To Buy 10 More BTC Before April”</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/kiyosaki-set-to-buy-10-more-bitcoin-before-april/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/kiyosaki-set-to-buy-10-more-bitcoin-before-april/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />著名作家罗伯特·清崎再次表达了对比特币的信心，计划在4月之前增加持有量，并预测最大加密货币资产会有显著增长。他提到了即将到来的比特币减半事件，认为这是他购买更多比特币的主要动机。他还建议投资者可以考虑通过Satoshi's或新的ETF购买1/10个比特币。此外，他强调了银币的投资价值，认为银币是目前最具吸引力的资产之一。罗伯特·清崎建议投资者不要投资法定货币，而应该选择银币、黄金或比特币，因为法定货币被认为是危险的。 <div>
<p>Acclaimed Author and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cathie-wood-says-bitcoin-headed-to-1-5-m/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin</a> bull Robert Kiyosaki has once again displayed his confidence in BTC, revealing his intentions of increasing his holdings as he predicts significant gains for the largest cryptocurrency asset.</p>
<h2>Robert Kiyosaki Targets Bitcoin At $100,000</h2>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/robert-kiyosaki-avocates-bitcoin-investment/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Robert Kiyosaki</a> reiterated his positive view on Bitcoin in a recent X <a href="https://x.com/theRealKiyosaki/status/1772115533502259692?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> where he spelled out his thoughts on the digital asset and disclosed his ambitions to purchase an additional 10 BTC before the month of April. The author cites the upcoming Bitcoin Halving event as the true motivation behind his plans to acquire 10 more BTC.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that the highly anticipated <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/why-bitcoin-halving-could-bring-uncertainty-to-mining-industry/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin halving</a> is anticipated to take place in less than 30 days from now. The event is believed to have the potential to be the next big trigger for the entire crypto market.</p>

<p>He further provided an accumulation strategy for investors who are concerned about affordability, suggesting, &#8220;If a buyer is unable to afford a whole BTC, they could want to think about purchasing 1/10 of the coin through Satoshi&#8217;s or the new ETFs.&#8221;</p>
<p>The post stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am buying 10 more Bitcoin before April. Why?  The “Having.” If you can not afford a whole Bitcoin, you may want to consider buying 1/10 of a coin, via the new ETFs or Satoshi’s.</p></blockquote>
<p>According to Robert Kiyosaki, if the aforementioned strategy plays out very well, an investor could own an entire BTC by the end of the year. Kiyosaki is very bullish about the leading crypto asset as he expects BTC to hit the $100,000 threshold by September this year.</p>
<p>He also advocates acquiring Silver coins, especially the United States silver eagles, if an investor is not interested in BTC. His friend Andy Schectman claims that the silver supply, which was formerly plentiful, is almost depleted. The reasons behind this is that China&#8217;s real estate market is toast, and smart money is aware that the US is the world&#8217;s biggest debtor nation. </p>
<p>Additionally, since 1990, Japan has been undergoing a depression; Germany is also experiencing one; mom-and-pop consumers are surviving solely on credit cards; banks are having troubles; and global conflict looms. </p>
<p>As a result, Kiyosaki is urging investors to consider investing in silver in order not to be poor given the current <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/robert-kiyosaki-safeguard-your-wealth-with-bitcoin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">economic uncertainty</a> around the world today.</p>
<h2>Investing In Fiat Currencies Is Not A Smart Idea</h2>
<p>Fiat currencies, sometimes considered fake money, are dangerous to save with, according to Kiyosaki and his associates Andy Schectman and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/good-things-on-the-way-for-bitcoin-investors/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Michael Saylor</a>. This simply suggested that investing in fiat currencies is not a smart move, and those engaging in the act are bound to end up poor in the future.</p>

<p>Thus, they advise everyone to invest in either silver, gold, or Bitcoin, citing that silver is the most affordable among these assets, and nearly everyone in the world can afford one silver coin or BTC Satoshi. &#8220;Coin prices for Bitcoin, Gold, and Silver are approximately $70,000, $2,500, and $35.00, respectively,&#8221; Kiyosaki added.</p>

<title>Battle Of Titans: Bitcoin Leads S&amp;P 500, Michael Saylor Asserts Amid Disagreement</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-leads-sp-500-michael-saylor-asserts/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。加密货币比特币的吸引力持续引发争论，支持者赞扬其不断增长的价值，批评者则警告可能存在泡沫。CEO Michael Saylor展示了比特币对传统资产的惊人增长，强调其作为主要投资力量的地位。然而，经济学家彼得·希夫对数字货币持怀疑态度，特别担忧MicroStrategy的激进投资策略。Saylor认为波动性是市场的自然现象，MicroStrategy增加比特币持有表明他们对数字货币的长期信心。然而，希夫等怀疑者强调了比特币的风险性，尤其是在监管环境不明朗的情况下。 <div>
<p>The allure of Bitcoin continues to spark debate, with proponents touting its skyrocketing value and critics warning of a potential bubble. This weekend, a prominent crypto advocate and CEO, Michael Saylor, reignited the discussion by showcasing Bitcoin&#8217;s impressive gains compared to traditional assets.</p>

<h2><strong>Bitcoin Debate: Saylor Vs. Schiff</strong></h2>
<p>Saylor, the chairman of MicroStrategy, a business intelligence firm, shared a chart highlighting the leading crypto&#8217;s over 430% growth against a backdrop of more modest gains from established investment options like the S&amp;P 500 (56%) and gold (7%). This, according to Saylor, underscores Bitcoin&#8217;s position as a dominant investment force.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">#Bitcoin</a> is Winning. <a href="https://t.co/3ESQRHKEDa" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/3ESQRHKEDa</a></p>
<p>— Michael Saylor<img alt="⚡" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/26a1.png" style="height: 1em;" /> (@saylor) <a href="https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1771638958906110426?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">March 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>However, not everyone is convinced. Renowned economist Peter Schiff, a vocal critic of cryptocurrencies, remains unconvinced. He expressed concern over Saylor&#8217;s aggressive investment strategy, particularly MicroStrategy&#8217;s recent acquisition of over 9,000 BTCs. Schiff emphasizes the inherent volatility of digital currencies, highlighting the potential for significant losses, especially considering MicroStrategy&#8217;s leveraged purchases.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">MicroStrategy has acquired an additional 9,245 BTC for ~$623.0M using proceeds from convertible notes &amp; excess cash for ~$67,382 per <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">#bitcoin</a>.

<p>— Michael Saylor<img alt="⚡" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/26a1.png" style="height: 1em;" /> (@saylor) <a href="https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1770061111146033385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">March 19, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-289357" height="224" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_8a90a8.png?resize=403%2C224" width="403" /></p>
<p>Saylor, however, remains <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/michael-saylor-to-buy-bitcoin-forever-details/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">unfazed by the recent price dip</a> (nearly 12%) following Bitcoin&#8217;s record high. He views volatility as a natural market phenomenon, even coining the phrase &#8220;volatility is vitality&#8221; to emphasize its role in a healthy market. This confidence extends to MicroStrategy&#8217;s investment strategy. The company has significantly increased its holdings, now totaling over 214,000 BTC, showcasing their long-term faith in the digital currency.</p>
<p>The contrasting views of Saylor and Schiff represent the ongoing debate surrounding Bitcoin. Proponents like Saylor point to its historical growth trajectory and its potential to disrupt traditional financial systems. They believe the digital asset&#8217;s limited supply (21 million coins will ever be mined) makes it a valuable hedge against inflation, similar to gold.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/vWYGx9uW/" width="1835" /></p>

<h2><strong>Risks And Regulations</strong></h2>
<p>However, skeptics like Schiff highlight the risks associated with <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">BTC price fluctuations.</a> Unlike established assets with underlying fundamentals like company performance or resource scarcity, Bitcoin&#8217;s value relies heavily on speculation and market sentiment. A sudden shift in investor confidence could trigger a dramatic price drop, leading to significant losses for investors like MicroStrategy.</p>
<p>Further complicating the picture is the evolving regulatory landscape surrounding cryptocurrencies. Governments worldwide are still grappling with how to regulate this new asset class. Stringent regulations could stifle innovation and adoption, potentially hindering Bitcoin&#8217;s future growth.</p>

<title>Why Tomorrow (March 26) Will Be Pivotal For Ripple And XRP</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/march-26-pivotal-for-ripple-xrp/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/march-26-pivotal-for-ripple-xrp/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章涉及XRP诉讼中的关键阶段，SEC已提交了开放性有关救济的文件，并计划在2024年3月26日公开。文章强调了SEC要求的救济金额的重要性，并提到了Ripple对其财务状况的保密性抗议。还提供了有关未来时间表的详细信息，包括法院文件的封存和编辑程序。文章指出了潜在的延迟可能性和不确定性。 XRP目前交易价格为$0.63218。 <div>
<p>In the XRP lawsuit, the next crucial phase is set to commence for Ripple Labs against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) tomorrow. Defense lawyer James K. Filan has recently casted the spotlight on March 26.</p>
<p>The SEC has already submitted its opening remedies-related brief along with supporting documentation, albeit under seal, to the court. This step is a significant progression in the protracted legal dispute that has spanned several years. Filan&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/FilanLaw/status/1771316749641687403" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">statement</a> via X emphasizes the forthcoming public disclosure of these documents, slated for no later than March 26, 2024.</p>

<p>&#8220;The SEC has filed, under seal, its opening remedies-related brief and supporting documents. These documents are not public yet. Public, redacted versions will be filed no later than Tuesday, March 26, 2024,&#8221; Filan communicated, highlighting the importance of this date in the context of the Ripple vs. SEC case.</p>
<h2>Ripple Vs. SEC: What To Expect</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s crucial to understand the nature and significance of an &#8220;opening remedies-related brief.&#8221; This document represents a foundational element in the litigation process. Essentially, the opening remedies-related brief is the initial submission by a party—in this instance, the SEC—outlining the specific legal and financial remedies it seeks from the court against the opposing party, Ripple Labs.</p>
<p>The amount of remedies that the SEC is demanding is eagerly awaited. In particular, it will be interesting to see how much the SEC demands for the institutional XRP sales after the start of the legal dispute.</p>
<p>As Bitcoinist <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sec-victory-ripple-disclosure-financial-statements/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">reported</a>, US District Judge Analisa Torres has ordered Ripple to provide its financial statements from 2022-2023 and contracts about <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-lawsuit-ripple-sec-settlement-rumors/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">“Institutional Sales” of XRP</a> in February, which the SEC argues are essential for determining an appropriate remedy.</p>

<p>Despite Ripple&#8217;s assertion that details regarding its financial health are both irrelevant to the case and highly confidential, the court has found such information potentially significant to the remedy stage of the proceedings. In its motion, the SEC contended that access to the company&#8217;s financial data is crucial for establishing the scale and nature of penalties and remedies that should be applied.</p>
<p>Just a few days ago, Ripple Labs and the SEC <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-lawsuit-ripple-sec-agreement-schedule/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">presented</a> a detailed schedule for the remedies phase to the Southern District Court of New York. This agenda outlines the procedures for sealing and redacting court documents pertinent to the remedies phase of the lawsuit—a critical aspect of the proceedings that will determine the legal and financial repercussions for Ripple Labs</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>March 22, 2024:</strong> The SEC filed its remedies brief under seal.</li>
<li><strong>March 25, 2024:</strong> A meeting between the SEC and Ripple to discuss and finalize the necessary redactions is happening today.</li>
<li><strong>March 26, 2024:</strong> The SEC&#8217;s deadline to file a public, redacted version of its opening brief.</li>
<li><strong>April 22, 2024:</strong> Ripple&#8217;s deadline to file its opposition brief.</li>
<li><strong>April 23-24, 2024:</strong> A planned meeting to finalize redactions for Ripple&#8217;s documents. If necessary Ripple will file a public, redacted version of its opposition brief.</li>
<li><strong>May 8, 2024:</strong> The SEC&#8217;s deadline for the public submission of its reply brief.</li>
</ul>
<p>The provided timeline offers clarity on the immediate procedural steps. Despite this clarity, there remains a level of uncertainty regarding the ultimate resolution of the case. Speculation about potential delays persists, particularly concerning whether the SEC may request an extension.</p>
<p>At press time, XRP traded at $0.63218.</p>

<title>Shiba Inu’s Shibarium Hits New Record Amid Chaotic Market Movements</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inus-shibarium-hits-new-record-amid-chaotic-market-movements/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inus-shibarium-hits-new-record-amid-chaotic-market-movements/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的<br />Shibarium, Shiba Inu's layer-2 solution,达到了超过367万美元的锁定总价值（TVL）的历史最高水平。此外，DAMN代币的推出和WoofSwap上的液态质押解决方案推动了Shibarium的TVL激增。这一里程碑显示了网络效应的潜力，带来了更多的用户，可能会推动SHIB价格进一步上涨。随着SHIB价格在短短24小时内上涨8.8%，投资者和链上指标显示未来会继续价格上涨的迹象。Lucie表示，SHIB价格可能在4月份的半减产前进一步上涨。 <div>
<p>Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s layer-2 solution, recently reached an all-time high total value locked (TVL) of over $3.67 million. As if the current bullish sentiment around the Shiba Inu&#8217;s ecosystem isn&#8217;t enough, its layer-2 solution has now reached a milestone that could lead to a further price surge. </p>

<p>According to data from <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Shibarium" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">DeFiLlama</a>, the total value locked on Shibarium jumped from $1.43 million on March 22 to $3.38 million on March 23, sparking optimism about SHIB’s price.</p>
<h2><b>Shibarium TVL Surges To New Milestone</b></h2>
<p>Shibarium’s total value locked hitting a new high shows the network effect in action. Interestingly, data shows Shibarium&#8217;s TVL has spent most of the year below $1 million before crossing over in late February. However, the TVL stands at $3.67 at the time of writing, revealing a positive change in the ecosystem. </p>
<p>The recent surge in TVL can be particularly attributed to the launch of the DAMN token on WoofSwap, which is a decentralized exchange built on the Shibarium. DAMN quickly gained attention as one of the hottest cryptocurrencies after its launch on March 18. </p>
<p>According to data from <a href="https://www.shibariumscan.io/stats" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Shibariumscan</a>, this frenzy led to a surge in the number of daily active users to 2,482 on the day of its launch. Similarly, WoofSwap&#8217;s TVL has grown by 8,988% in the past seven days. </p>
<p>Another catalyst for the surge in TVL was the launch of KNINE tokens, a liquid staking solution on the Shibarium blockchain.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/IdmMEKDj/" width="2475" /></p>

<h2><b>What’s Next For Shiba Inu?</b></h2>
<p>Naturally, Shibarium’s recent milestones have sparked <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-price-soars-10-in-reaction-to-explosive-2367-shib-burn-surge/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">optimism about SHIB’s price</a> as the cryptocurrency is well known to react to updates about the layer-2 network. This growth shows that Shibarium is attracting more users, which could boost SHIB’s price. </p>
<p>Shibarium&#8217;s new milestone saw SHIB rallying 8.8% to $0.00002828 in less than 24 hours. This price rally highlights the close correlation between the growth of Shibarium and the SHIB price.</p>
<p>SHIB is trading at $0.00002806 at the time of writing. The cryptocurrency is in fact, still riding on the back of a 193% gain in the past 30 days <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-short-term-holders/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">despite being 37% down</a> from its $0.00004456 earlier in the month. </p>

<p>On-chain metrics and investor sentiment point to a continued price surge in the near future. On-chain analytics platform Santiment recently pointed out that Bitcoin, along with SHIB and other meme coins, remained the focus of traders throughout the weekend. SHIB, which naturally has a <a href="https://app.intotheblock.com/coin/SHIB" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">strong price correlation</a> with Bitcoin, could <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-market-cap-price-surgeretesting-2021-highs/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reignite a surge in tandem</a>.</p>
<p>According to Lucie, Shiba Inu&#8217;s marketing lead, the price of SHIB could <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-rise-250-pre-bitcoin-halving/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">surge by 250%</a> before the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/why-bitcoin-halving-could-bring-uncertainty-to-mining-industry/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">next Bitcoin halving</a> which is slated to occur in April.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章提到Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood重申了对比特币的看法，预测其价格可能达到380万美元。Wood认为比特币是一个“金融高速公路”，强调了其在新兴市场中的重要性，并指出其价格可能在未来继续上涨。她还提到了比特币在发展中国家中的采用情况，以及机构对比特币的兴趣增加以及SEC对机构投资比特币的批准，将是比特币价格上涨的重要推动力。此外，文章还提到了比特币最近的价格走势以及Spot Bitcoin ETFs的推出。 <div>
<p>Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood has reiterated her <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/cathie-wood-bitcoin-gold/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">bullish stance</a> on Bitcoin. The investment mogul, who recently disclosed she <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cathie-wood-placed-25-wealth-bitcoin-bold-unveiled/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">allocated 25% of her wealth</a> into Bitcoin, has now predicted the cryptocurrency is on a highway to new highs. </p>

<p>Particularly, Wood called Bitcoin a “financial super highway,” amidst discussions of its importance in emerging markets. As a result, she reiterated that the price of Bitcoin could end up as high as $3.8 million.</p>
<h2><b>Cathie Wood Reiterates Bullish Stance On Bitcoin</b></h2>
<p>Wood made her <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cathie-wood-bitcoin-is-king-of-security/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">very bullish prediction</a> at a Friday Bitcoin Investor Day conference in New York. Interestingly, this recent prediction surpasses another one made in January where she predicted that the digital asset <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cathie-wood-sees-bitcoin-at-1-5m-by-2030/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">could potentially hit $1.5 million</a> by 2030. This means Bitcoin could increase by another $2.3 million after reaching her existing target. </p>
<p>Wood credits this price growth to a major shift in the global market dynamics as Bitcoin continues to receive adoption, especially in developing countries. She made a case of Nigeria, whose struggle with unprecedented inflation in recent times has pushed its citizens to run to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to hedge against inflation. </p>
<p>“There are signals that not all is well in the world,” she said.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Wood revealed that Ark Invest, her investment company, has now <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/ark-invest-pivots-to-bitcoin/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">diverted most of its attention</a> into emerging markets such as this. She also noted that Bitcoin could continue on a price surge as institution interest continues to rise and institutions start to allocate a little more than 5% of their portfolio to the cryptocurrencies. </p>
<p>At the same time, Wood believes the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s recent greenlight for institutional investment in Bitcoin is a huge driving force for its growth to $3.8 million.</p>
<p>“We think Bitcoin has miles to go,” Wood said.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/Ju7s87Iy/" width="1835" /></p>

<h2><b>What’s Next For Bitcoin?</b></h2>
<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $64,256, up by 25% in the past 30 days. Most of Bitcoin&#8217;s price growth in the past few months has been centered around the launch of Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US. Wood&#8217;s Ark Invest was one of the Bitcoin ETF issuers approved by the SEC and has done relatively well since then. These ETFs have now received a total net flow of $11.269 billion since their launch.</p>

<p>Bitcoin, however, is <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-long-term-holders-price-top-glassnode/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">currently struggling</a> with its price surge. The crypto is now down 12% from an all-time high of $73,780 which it <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/breaking-news-ticker/breaking-bitcoin-hits-new-all-time-high-surging-past-70000-for-the-first-time-in-history/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">attained earlier in the month</a>. At the same time, Spot Bitcoin ETFs witnessed <a href="https://x.com/BitMEXResearch/status/1771465855680823612?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">consecutive days of outflows</a> last week amidst the price struggle. On the other hand, Bitcoin continues to <a href="https://x.com/santimentfeed/status/1771358045098086909?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">attract bullish sentiment</a> from investors and the cryptocurrency could resume its price surge very soon. </p>

<title>From Bytes To Bites: Iceland Prioritizes Food Over Crypto Mining</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章介绍了冰岛政府从支持加密货币挖矿产业向增强国内食品生产的转变。由冰岛总理领导的这一战略决定旨在增加食品安全和实现更平衡的能源网络，为冰岛带来更绿色和更自给自足的未来。这一举措将增加农业产出，增强食品安全，创造就业机会，刺激本地经济，并通过将清洁能源供应给更广泛的农业运营来扩大冰岛强大的可再生能源网络。对于现有的加密货币挖矿运营在冰岛的影响尚待观察，但冰岛的战略转变标志着全球对资源负责任使用和长期可持续性重要性的讨论。 <div>
<p>Iceland, the volcanic island nation famed for its stunning landscapes and clean energy production, is embarking on a new chapter. In a move that highlights a growing global trend, The country is<a href="https://bitperfect.pe/en/iceland-pm-sways-energy-use-away-from-crypto-mining-to-agriculture/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> shifting its focus</a> from supporting the cryptocurrency mining industry towards bolstering domestic food production.</p>
<h2><strong>Iceland Pivots: From Crypto To Crops</strong></h2>
<p>This strategic decision, driven by a desire for increased food security and a more balanced energy grid, positions Iceland for a greener and more self-sufficient future.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir spearheaded this shift, citing the need to prioritize sectors with a more direct impact on national well-being. While crypto mining has played a role in our renewable energy sector, stated Jakobsdóttir, they recognize the importance of a balanced and sustainable approach. By prioritizing food production, the government ensures its constituents have access to a secure and reliable food supply.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-289266" height="290" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_335c72.png?resize=523%2C290" width="523" /></p>


<p>Iceland&#8217;s abundance of geothermal and hydroelectric power plants has made it a global leader in renewable energy production per capita. This same clean energy has also fueled the rise of <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6432a24b-b7c4-4c2f-85a8-79108dbe0644" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">crypto mining operations</a> within the country. However, concerns surrounding the environmental impact of crypto mining, coupled with a desire for greater food independence, have prompted this strategic pivot.</p>
<p>The move towards domestic food production presents a multitude of benefits for the country. Increased agricultural output will not only bolster food security but also create new jobs and stimulate the local economy.</p>












<h2><strong>Renewable Energy And Agriculture</strong></h2>
<p>Furthermore, this shift creates an opportunity to expand the reach of Iceland&#8217;s robust renewable energy grid. By supplying clean energy to a wider range of agricultural operations, the country can ensure a more sustainable and efficient food production system.</p>












<p>According to Jakobsdóttir, the energy demands of the country&#8217;s 375,000 citizens should take precedence over data centres and instead use precious renewable electricity for homes and other sectors.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/3XxLQse5/" width="1835" /></p>

























<p>“Bitcoin is an issue worldwide . . . but data centers in Iceland use a significant share of our green energy,” the prime minister said. A new proposal to boost wind power would put more premium on clean industries to achieve carbon neutrality, she added.</p>

<p>The transition to a larger-scale food production industry, however, is not without its challenges. Iceland&#8217;s harsh climate and limited arable land necessitate innovative solutions.</p>
<p>Experts believe that advancements in controlled-environment agriculture (CEA) technologies, such as hydroponics and vertical farming, will play a crucial role in overcoming these limitations.</p>
<p>The impact of this decision on existing crypto mining operations in Iceland remains to be seen. While some operations may choose to relocate, others might adapt by utilizing more energy-efficient mining practices. Regardless, Iceland&#8217;s strategic shift signifies a growing global conversation about the responsible use of resources and the importance of long-term sustainability.</p>
<p>By prioritizing food security and a robust domestic agricultural sector, Iceland is charting a course for a greener and more self-sufficient future. This decision serves as a model for other nations grappling with similar challenges, demonstrating the potential of clean energy to not only power a digital future but also cultivate a more sustainable food system.</p>

<title>Bitcoin ETF Buzz In UK: Kraken Executive Pushes For Market Access</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etf-buzz-in-uk-kraken-executive-pushes-for-market-access/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章讨论了在英国重新燃起的关于比特币交易所交易基金（ETFs）的辩论，行业领袖呼吁为投资者提供更广泛的访问权限。Kraken UK的Bivu Das认为，比特币ETFs为建立英国作为真正的加密中心提供了基本基础。尽管FCA仍保持谨慎态度，但最近批准了加密ETNs的推出，这表明他们可能会对更广泛的加密投资机会持开放态度。Coinbase UK CEO Daniel Seifert也支持扩大投资选择，认为更多的投资产品如ETFs会为消费者提供更多选择。文章指出，尽管FCA需顾及保护零售投资者免受潜在危害，但随着全球对比特币ETF的接受程度不断增加和投资者需求增加，FCA可能不可避免地将采取更开放的监管态度。 <div>
<p>The simmering debate over Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the UK has reignited, with industry leaders calling for wider access for investors. This comes on the heels of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving Bitcoin ETFs in January, sparking a surge in investment and renewed calls for a similar move by the UK&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).</p>

<h2><strong>UK&#8217;s Bitcoin ETF Advocacy</strong></h2>
<p>Bivu Das, Managing Director of Kraken UK, believes Bitcoin ETFs offer a &#8220;basic fundamental&#8221; for establishing the UK as a true crypto hub. These instruments allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin&#8217;s price movements without directly owning the cryptocurrency itself, potentially offering a more regulated and accessible entry point.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">ICYMI: Kraken UK Managing Director Bivu Das says he&#8217;d &#8220;absolutely&#8221; like to see a <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">#Bitcoin</a> ETF in the UK, providing regulated access to crypto exposure currently lacking and boost UK&#8217;s crypto hub ambitions, and legitimize bitcoin for institutions.</p>
<p>— AP Crypto (@AP_Crypto_) <a href="https://twitter.com/AP_Crypto_/status/1771514821940547931?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">March 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>However, the FCA remains cautious. In 2021, they banned the retail sale of crypto-derivative products, including exchange-traded products (ETPs) backed by cryptocurrencies. This stance, some argue, puts the UK at a disadvantage compared to the US, where retail investors can readily invest in <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etf-alert-analyst-issues-major-warning/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin ETFs.</a></p>
<p>Das contends that the regulatory landscape has evolved since the 2021 ban. He believes ETFs could even alleviate some regulatory concerns, as investors wouldn&#8217;t directly hold the underlying Bitcoin. This could potentially pave the way for a more open approach from the FCA.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/WjE9FkAe/" width="1835" /></p>

<p>There are signs the FCA might be inching towards a more accommodating stance. They recently approved the launch of crypto ETNs, but only for institutional investors. This move, while limited, could be seen as a cautious step towards wider crypto investment opportunities.</p>
<p>While the regulatory body remains cautious, warning of potential risks for retail investors in the volatile crypto market, the FCA&#8217;s recent actions suggest a willingness to explore the space further.</p>

<h2><strong>Expanding UK&#8217;s Investment Options</strong></h2>
<p>Coinbase UK CEO, Daniel Seifert, echoes Das&#8217; sentiment. He believes &#8220;consumers have more options&#8221; with a wider range of investment products like ETFs. This push for increased investor choice aligns with a broader trend towards democratizing access to financial markets.</p>
<p>However, the FCA faces a delicate balancing act. While fostering innovation in the crypto sector is crucial for maintaining the UK&#8217;s financial competitiveness, protecting retail investors from potential harm remains a top priority. The high volatility of the crypto market raises concerns about the suitability of such complex instruments for inexperienced investors.</p>
<p>The recent influx of billions into US<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> Bitcoin</a> ETFs highlights the growing investor appetite for these products. This surge in demand could put further pressure on the FCA to revisit its stance. The potential benefits of increased investment and a more robust crypto ecosystem could outweigh the perceived risks, eventually leading to a more open regulatory environment.</p>
<p>The future of Bitcoin ETFs in the UK remains uncertain. The FCA is likely to take a measured approach, carefully evaluating the potential benefits and risks before making any significant changes. However, the growing global acceptance of Bitcoin ETFs, coupled with increasing investor demand, suggests that a more open approach from the FCA might be inevitable.</p>

<title>US Bitcoin Miners Move Old Equipment Overseas – Here’s Why</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章首先介绍了比特币减半事件即将到来，导致挖矿收入减半。随后提到美国挖矿者正准备应对后果，其中600,000台旧型号矿机计划转移到非洲和南美等成本更低的地区。特别关注埃塞俄比亚作为比特币挖矿中心的发展，因为当地廉价电力吸引了大量旧型矿机的转移。Ethiopia的电价仅为每千瓦时3美分，这是吸引挖矿者的主要因素之一。 <div>
<p>The Bitcoin halving, one of the most anticipated crypto events in 2024, is less than a month away, and miners seem to be in full preparation for its aftermath. The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/why-bitcoin-halving-could-bring-uncertainty-to-mining-industry/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">April event is expected to slash mining rewards on the Bitcoin network in half</a>, making the validation of transactions less lucrative.</p>
<p>As of now, miners receive 6.25 BTC for each validated block added to the network. However, the halving will split their revenue to 3.125 BTC for each block. Interestingly, many miners in the United States seem to be making adjustments, including upgrading to more efficient mining computers, to ensure they remain profitable.</p>
<h2>Why Bitcoin Mining Machines Are Being Moved Out Of The US</h2>
<p>According to crypto-mining services and logistics provider Luxor Technology, about 600,000 S19 series mining rigs, which account for a large proportion of machines currently in use in the United States, are being moved out of the country. The mining computers are being transferred (or sold) primarily to countries in Africa and South America, a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-23/bitcoin-halving-spurs-exodus-of-old-us-mining-computers-abroad" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bloomberg report</a> revealed.</p>

<p>The S19 series are older models of Bitcoin mining machines, and they might not be cost-efficient to run in countries like the US, where energy costs are relatively high. <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-halving-havoc-only-a-few-miners-may-survive/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">This explains why the miners in the country</a> are ditching the older computers for more efficient ones.</p>
<p>The report quoted another major player in the Bitcoin mining industry, saying that while the S19 series and similar models might not be cost-effective to operate in the United States, they “can still generate decent profits and get an extended life if hosted” in certain regions in Africa.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some miners opt to sell their hardware, with buyers of the old machines operating in parts of the world with cheap power. Many of these buyers are from Paraguay, Uruguay, Tanzania, and, most notably, Ethiopia.</p>
<p>According to Luxor, the upcoming halving event has been influencing the behavior of buyers towards the purchase of old mining machines. “Some buyers are waiting until after the event to purchase older computers, assuming their prices will drop even more,” the company revealed.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">With the Bitcoin halving approaching, Luxor estimates that around 600,000 S19 bitcoin rigs, the majority of machines currently in use, are moving primarily out of the U.S. to places like Africa and South America, where energy is cheaper. The S19 can cost up to $11,500 per unit to…</p>

<p></p>
<h2>Ethiopia: The Next Crypto Mining Hub?</h2>
<p>Ethiopia, a country located in the Horn of Africa, is forging a strong reputation for itself in the crypto and Bitcoin mining niche. As inferred earlier, a significant proportion of the old US machines are being transferred to the East African nation.</p>

<p>Ethiopia’s cheap electricity has been pinpointed as the major factor driving this development. The Bloomberg report revealed that electricity is about 3 cents per kWh in Ethiopia, while it ranges between <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ex-white-house-official-says-bitcoin-could-reach-170000-post-halving/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">3 to 6 cents in the US</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier in February, Bloomberg disclosed that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-migration-chinese-miners-flock-to-ethiopia/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Chinese crypto mining companies are increasing their investment in Ethiopia</a>. While China’s strict stance against cryptocurrency is believed to have played a role, Ethiopia’s cheap power seems to have played a bigger part in the firms’ move.</p>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。<br />文章提到了Ava Labs联合创始人Emin Gün Sirer对一些Layer-2解决方案的警示，指出这些项目可能对投资者构成风险。他列举了几个常见的红旗，包括项目的故事与技术之间的不一致，中心化的序列器，通过代币销售筹集资金等。此外，他还提出了一个简单的测试，帮助投资者筛选真正有价值的项目，建议评估项目是否为当前加密生态系统的关键问题提供了真正的解决方案。 <div>
<p>Co-founder of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/citibank-trials-tokenization-equity-funds-avalanche/">Avalanche blockchain</a>, Emin Gün Sirer, has raised an alert on the infiltration of certain layer-2 solutions, which poses risks to investors. In an <a href="https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1771658050228617428" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">X post on March 23</a>, the Ava Labs boss expressed concerns over these “trash” projects while educating users on several of their common characteristics.</p>

<h2>Red Flags To Watch For In L2 Projects &#8211; Avalanche Co-founder </h2>
<p>According to Gün Sirer, the rise in substandard L2 projects represents the next big hazard in the crypto ecosystem following the crypto exchange heist pulled off by former<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-50-years/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> FTX founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF)</a>. The prominent crypto figure argued the procedures involved in launching an L2 solution were rather loose, allowing the influx of bad actors who created projects with no actual value. </p>
<p>In the interest of promoting investor security, Emin Gün Sirer then proceeded to list several red flags that accompany these risky L2 solutions. Firstly, he stated that there is usually a discrepancy between the project’s narrative and technology, i.e., its marketing pitch does not align with its technical implementation. </p>
<p>Examples of such projects are those with centralized sequencers without fraud-proof, which is against the cryptocurrency principles of decentralization and security. Emin Gün Sirer also highlighted L2 solutions that conduct token sales to raise funds rather than for a specific, practical purpose on the network, indicating it was likely to be a dubious investment. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the Avalanche co-founder also spoke about L2 projects in which founders sold their personal native tokens before the launch. Regardless of the motive, Gün Sirer characterized a large volume of native token sales pre-launch as a massive red flag. </p>
<p>Another point the crypto figure highlighted was projects with low-float tokens which allow for artificial inflation of the token’s value through manipulation tactics as commonly done by SBF. Finally, Gün Sirer advised investors to pay attention to project founders&#8217; morals and habits and screening for any form of personal misconduct.

<h2>The Simple Authenticity Test By Emin Gün Sirer</h2>
<p>In addition to the red flags mentioned above, Emin Gün Sirer also proposed a simple test that could help investors in screening through the masses of L2 projects being launched daily for authentic, profitable ventures. </p>
<p>Firstly, the Ava Labs founder suggested identifying the main issues &#8211; known as “blockers” &#8211; in the crypto space at any time. He stated that, for example, issues such as scalability and performance were quite significant until blockchains such as Avalanche and<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-meme-coin-mania-breaks-records/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> Solana</a> emerged with solutions. </p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Emin Gün Sirer believes that supporting multiple use cases on the same platform as well as integration with traditional finance (TradFi) are currently critical issues facing the crypto ecosystem. Before investing in an L2 solution, the Avalanche co-founder advises users to assess where the project offers a genuine solution to these challenges. </p>

<p>According to the filing, the sale of the two private aircraft has been sought to prevent their devaluation, as these <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ftx-ceos-asset-recovery-escalates-as-sam-bankman-fried-trial-looms/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">assets</a> were previously slated for forfeiture in October 2023 due to their connection to <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/ftx/sam-bankman-fried-allegedly-used-customer-funds/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bankman-Fried’s criminal case</a>.  </p>
<p>Currently, the government has not disclosed the precise selling price for the private aircrafts. However, they have appraised the jets at $15.9 million and $12.5 million, respectively. </p>
<p>Furthermore, Williams has revealed that the court order was made in agreement with multiple parties including FTX’s former executive, Ryan Salame, the defendant, the founder of Trans-Island Airways, Paul Aranha, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-revised-settlement-proposal-amid-objection/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">FTX debtors</a>, the government, Capital Peak Aviation and Island Air Capital (IAC). </p>
<p>The attorney disclosed that the Embraer Legacy aircraft will be transported to a Florida airport by the IAC, with the delivery expected within 30 days of the court order. </p>
<p>As for the Global 5000 aircraft, the filing has revealed that it remains under secure custody, controlled by the United States Marshals Service (USMS). The USMS will manage the jet’s sale proceedings, which will be held in escrow within the enforcement agency’s Seized Asset Deposit Fund (SADF) until further order of the court. </p>

<title>SEC Chair Gary Gensler Says Crypto Industry Needs ‘Disinfectant’ – Here’s Why</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/gary-gensler-says-crypto-needs-disinfectant/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/gary-gensler-says-crypto-needs-disinfectant/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。SEC主席Gensler强调了加密货币市场的透明度和强制披露的重要性。他警告了那些试图避开注册要求的参与者，并呼吁更严格的监管。他还强调了创新与透明度和投资者保护之间的平衡，并指出比特币的波动性。通过促进更加公开透明的市场, Gensler的讲话可能导致加密货币生态系统更加稳健可信，吸引更多的机构和零售投资者。 <div>
<p>In a passionate address to Columbia Law School, Gary Gensler, the Chair of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), delivered <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-columbia-law-school-032224" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">a scathing critique of crypto industry participants</a> who evade registration requirements.</p>
<h2><strong>Promoting Transparency in Cryptocurrency</strong></h2>
<p>Gensler&#8217;s speech focused on the need for transparency and mandatory disclosure in the cryptocurrency markets, drawing on the famous quote by Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis that &#8220;Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gensler expressed his concern about certain participants in the crypto securities markets who seek to avoid registration requirements, thereby evading mandatory disclosure. He stressed the importance of transparency in the industry and highlighted the potential benefits of applying stricter regulatory oversight.</p>
<p>By shining a light on the practices and operations of market participants, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/trader-warns-sec-chair-gensler-shouldnt-be-trusted/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Gensler</a> aimed to promote a more accountable and trustworthy crypto ecosystem.</p>
<blockquote>
&#8220;There are participants in crypto securities markets that seek to avoid these registration requirements. No registration means no mandatory disclosure. Many would agree that the crypto markets could use a little disinfectant,&#8221; he said.
</blockquote>
<p>The SEC Chair&#8217;s remarks come at a time when the commission is actively pursuing<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sec-crypto-lawyers-leave-as-genslers-grip-tightens/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> enforcement actions against major crypto firms,</a> including Kraken, Binance, Ripple, and Coinbase. These actions underscore the SEC&#8217;s commitment to ensuring compliance within the industry.</p>
<p>However, Gensler&#8217;s focus on transparency goes beyond enforcement, as he believes that the entire crypto market can benefit from increased disclosure and regulatory compliance.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/alD4Mo1l/" width="1835" /></p>

<h2><strong>Gensler&#8217;s Regulatory Vision</strong></h2>
<p>Advocacy groups and crypto companies have long called for clear regulatory guidelines to foster innovation within the United States. While Gensler acknowledged the importance of innovation, he emphasized that it should not come at the expense of transparency and investor protection.</p>
<p>By advocating for mandatory disclosure and registration requirements, Gensler seeks to strike a balance between fostering innovation and maintaining market integrity.</p>
<p>Gensler&#8217;s call for transparency aligns with his previous warnings that cryptocurrency exchanges must register with the SEC and adhere to the same rules as traditional financial companies. He has consistently emphasized the need for accountability and regulation in the crypto space, aiming to ensure that investors are adequately informed and protected.</p>

<p>In addition to his focus on transparency, Gensler also addressed the risks associated with investing in cryptocurrencies. He likened Bitcoin to a roller coaster ride, cautioning investors about the volatility of the asset. While acknowledging the market&#8217;s enthusiasm, he stressed the importance of evaluating the fundamentals of cryptocurrencies to make informed investment decisions.</p>
<p>As Gensler&#8217;s &#8220;disinfectant&#8221; tirade reverberates throughout the cryptocurrency industry, stakeholders are left contemplating the future of regulation and transparency.</p>
<p>The SEC&#8217;s ongoing enforcement actions and his steadfast commitment to mandatory disclosure signal a shift toward greater scrutiny and accountability in the market.</p>
<p>The impact of Gensler&#8217;s speech and the SEC&#8217;s actions will likely be felt across the industry. Market participants may face increased pressure to comply with registration requirements and provide transparent disclosures. This could potentially lead to a more robust and trustworthy crypto ecosystem, attracting both institutional and retail investors.</p>

<title>SEC Delays Decision On Grayscale’s Ethereum ETF – Here’s The New Deadline</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/sec-delays-decision-on-grayscales-ethereum-etf-here/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/sec-delays-decision-on-grayscales-ethereum-etf-here/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。美国证券交易委员会（SEC）再次延长了 Grayscale 的以太坊期货信托交易所交易基金（ETF）的决定期限。该决定被延迟至5月30日，以便“有足够的时间考虑提出的规则变更”。有分析师认为 Grayscale 的以太坊期货 ETF 申请可能是为了通过获批其现货 ETH 交易所交易产品。此外，由于SEC对加密公司发出传票并未积极与ETF发行人沟通，使得以太坊现货ETF的批准可能性很小。 <div>
<p>The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-ceo-predicts-sec-setback-in-ethereum-case/">United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</a> has announced an extension &#8211; yet again &#8211; of the deadline for asset management firm Grayscale’s Ethereum Futures Trust exchange-traded fund (ETF). Initially published for comment in the Federal Register on October 3, 2023, the SEC claims to be extending the deadline to have “sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change.”</p>
<h2>Final Deadline For Grayscale’s Futures Ethereum ETF</h2>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/nysearca/2024/34-99842.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">March 22 filing</a>, the SEC disclosed that it will prolong the decision-making process for Grayscale’s Ethereum Futures ETF. The commission has now moved the deadline from March 31 to May 30 to decide whether or not to approve the investment product.</p>
<p>A part of the SEC’s filing read: </p>
<blockquote><p>The Commission finds that it is appropriate to designate a longer period within which to issue an order approving or disapproving the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein. Accordingly, the Commission, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,10 designates May 30, 2024, as the date by which the Commission shall either approve or disapprove the proposed rule change.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sec-delays-fidelity-spot-ethereum-etf/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">James Seyffart</a>, a Bloomberg ETF analyst, did not express surprise at this deadline extension. “There&#8217;s the delay order for Grayscale&#8217;s Ethereum Futures ETF Filing &#8212; as expected,” the analyst said in his <a href="https://x.com/JSeyff/status/1771296290149683490?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post on the X</a> platform.</p>
<p>In November, Seyffart said he believes that Grayscale’s application for an Ether Futures ETF is “nothing but a trojan horse” to get approval for its spot ETH exchange-traded product. Hence, it would be interesting to see how this latest delay influences the clearance of the spot ETH ETF, especially considering the slim odds of approval.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sec-initiates-grayscales-spot-ethereum-etf-decision/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> SEC delayed its decision on whether to approve Grayscale’s spot Ethereum ETF</a> earlier in January while also opening the application to public comments. In the most recent development, the asset management revised its 19b-4 form in a bid to force the regulator’s hand.</p>
<h2>Approval Of ETH Spot ETF Seems Very Unlikely: Alex Thorn</h2>
<p>Alex Thorn, Galaxy Digital’s head of research, has <a href="https://www.galaxy.com/insights/research/top-stories-of-the-week-3-22-24/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">said</a> the approval of the Ethereum spot ETFs is looking very unlikely at the moment. This reasoning is based on the SEC’s subpoena of crypto firms and lack of engagement with potential ETF issuers.</p>
<p>According to a recent report, the SEC sent subpoenas to various crypto companies regarding their relationships with the Ethereum Foundation. </p>

<p>Thorn posits that the SEC could be investigating whether the original Ethereum ICO (Initial Coin Offering) was an unregistered securities offering rather than <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-in-the-hot-seat-sec-security-label-looms/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">classifying the secondary trading of Ether today as securities trading</a>.</p>
<p>The analyst mentioned that it is unclear how this probe alone hurts the chance of ETH ETF approval. However, he believes that when this is combined with the fact that the SEC is not actively communicating with applicants, the authorization of the ETFs in May seems very unlikely.</p>

<title>Crypto Pundit Predicts Massive Price Surge For Dogecoin – Here’s The Target</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-pundit-predicts-price-surge-for-dogecoin/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-pundit-predicts-price-surge-for-dogecoin/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。加密分析师DonAlt提出了对主要的狗狗币的看涨观点，表示DOGE有可能达到1美元。他认为DOGE是他关注的资产之一，并建议0.1美元是一个良好的入场点。此外，他认为DOGE比比特币更有投资价值。另一位分析师预测狗狗币的主要竞争对手狗狗币和Shiba Inu也有望实现显著涨幅，可能创下新的历史最高纪录。这些预测再次突显了这些加密货币之间的竞争。Shiba Inu在今年初已经取得了超过160%的涨幅，比狗狗币的80%更高。 <div>
<p>Crypto analyst DonAlt has provided a bullish narrative for the foremost meme coin, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/big-money-eyes-dogecoin-whale-activity-explodes-600/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Dogecoin (DOGE)</a>. This follows his recent statement suggesting that DOGE could still <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-too-much-firepower/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">move over 500%</a> from its current price levels. </p>
<h2><b>Dogecoin Could Rise To $1</b></h2>
<p>DonAlt mentioned in a video on his YouTube channel that DOGE “it isn’t too unlikely for Dogecoin to go to $1.” This raises the possibility of the meme coin breaking its all-time high (ATH) of $0.7376 on its road to $1, which no doubt presents <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-10-largest-meme-coin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">mouth-watering gains for investors</a>. </p>

<p>The crypto analyst made this statement while revealing that Dogecoin was <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/dogecoin-shiba-inu-pepe-explode/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">one of the altcoins</a> he had his eyes on. He added that he found the meme coin “interesting” because it dipped back into support on the PTC chart. Meanwhile, DonAlt suggested that $0.1 is a good entry point for those looking to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-when-dogecoin-does-this/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">invest in DOGE</a> and stated that he will probably buy if it drops to that level. </p>
<p>The crypto analyst remarked that he would also look to Bitcoin’s price movement to determine whether or not to buy Dogecoin now. If Bitcoin confirms a bullish sentiment, he will buy the meme coin at whatever price level he finds it at since it is still a long way from hitting $1. </p>
<p>Interestingly, the crypto analyst suggested that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-coinbase-futures-listing/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">DOGE</a> was a better investment than Bitcoin. He stated that DOGE could trade as high as $2 if Bitcoin never drops back to the $60,000 range. That is why he finds investing in the meme coin more attractive than buying the flagship crypto at $60,000 and seeing it <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-new-ath-by-year-end/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">rise to $90,000</a>. </p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/pMXavQzo/" width="1835" /></p>

<h2><b>Shiba Inu Could Also See Significant Gains</b></h2>
<p>Crypto analyst and trader Xanrox also <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-surge-crypto-shib/#:~:text=In%20a%20recent%20analysis%2C%20Xanrox,next%20wave%20to%20the%20upside.%E2%80%9D" rel="noopener " target="_blank">recently predicted</a> that DOGE’s top contender, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-23-5-million-shiba-inu/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Shiba Inu (SHIB)</a>, could witness a price surge of over 300%. This also means that SHIB, like DOGE, could hit a new ATH in this <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/crypto-analyst-shiba-inu-target/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">market cycle</a>. Meanwhile, analysts like Javon Marks have also <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/crypto-analyst-shiba-inu-target/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">raised</a> the possibility of SHIB deleting another zero and rising to as high as $0.0001553. </p>
<p>These massive price predictions for DOGE and SHIB again underscore the battle between these crypto tokens to assert themselves as the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/crypto-analyst-shiba-inu-target/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">most valuable meme coin</a>. So far, they have made significant moves in the market since the beginning of the year. However, there is a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/crypto-analyst-shiba-inu-target/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">growing feeling</a> that SHIB could overtake DOGE at some point. </p>

<p>SHIB has already seen more gains since the beginning of the year, boasting a year-to-date (YTD) gain of over 160% compared to DOGE’s 80%.</p>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。文章谈到了Shiba Inu Metaverse项目顾问Marcie Jastrow被指与骗局有关。Trophias称她为“专业骗子”，而Jastrow否认了这些指控，表示她与公司之间存在知识产权纠纷。投资者对项目仍持乐观态度，但一些人对Jastrow把资源用于其他项目而不是Metaverse项目表示批评。文章指出了项目的透明度和未来发展路径的不确定性。 <div>
<p>In a recent turn of events, Marcie Jastrow, the advisor for the Shiba Inu Metaverse project, has found herself at the center of controversy surrounding allegations of scam affiliation.</p>
<p>The accusations surfaced after Jastrow dissociated herself from a company and removed any trace of her association with it on her LinkedIn account. Trophias, a former member of the SHIB Defense Breed, went as far as labeling Jastrow a &#8220;professional scammer.&#8221;</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p></p>
<h2><strong>Jastrow&#8217;s Response</strong></h2>
<p>Jastrow swiftly responded to these allegations, vehemently denying any involvement in scams. She clarified that her decision to dissociate from the company was driven by disputes over intellectual property rights, rather than any fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>Jastrow emphasized that the situation had become a distraction, leading her to sever all ties with the company. While she did not address Trophias directly, her statement aimed to set the record straight.</p>

<p></p>
<p>However, Jastrow&#8217;s call for assistance for the Welly Friends project, which focuses on blockchain adoption in the agricultural scene, drew criticism from some quarters.</p>
<p>Detractors argued that she should prioritize the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Shiba Inu</a> Metaverse project instead. The conflicting opinions regarding Jastrow&#8217;s priorities and resource allocation have further fueled the ongoing debate.</p>

<h2><strong>Shiba Inu Metaverse Scrutiny</strong></h2>

Trophias&#8217; accusations have raised questions about the project&#8217;s integrity, but without concrete evidence, it is difficult to ascertain the veracity of the claims.</p>
<p>The ongoing dispute over intellectual property rights adds another layer of complexity to the situation. While Jastrow has clarified her stance, the lack of transparency surrounding the specifics of the dispute leaves room for speculation.

<title>Do Kwon To Be Released From Prison But Remanded To Montenegro – Details</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/do-kwon-released-from-prison-remanded-to-montenegro/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/do-kwon-released-from-prison-remanded-to-montenegro/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。Terraform Labs联合创始人Do Kwon被发现在黑山持有伪造文件并被捕。他因涉嫌在2022年Terra生态系统崩溃中欺诈用户50亿美元而被韩国通缉。尽管他在黑山服刑，但最高法院暂停了他被引渡到韩国的决定，以评估下级法院审查程序是否存在违规。这可能会延迟引渡程序。 <div>
<p>Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon is now set to be released from prison in Montenegro; however, the South Korean will remain restricted to the borders of the European nation pending a fixed date for his extradition to his home country. </p>

<h2>Do Kwon Serves Time In Montenegro, Awaits Extradition Decision</h2>
<p>In March 2023, Do Kwon, alongside former Terraform CFO Han Chang-joon, was apprehended by local authorities in Montenegro for traveling with falsified documents. This development came as the crypto mogul was wanted by legal authorities <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sec-sue-terraform-labs/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">in the US</a> and South Korea for crimes of fraud following the crash of the prominent Terra ecosystem in 2022, which wiped out over $50 billion of users&#8217; funds. </p>
<p>Do Kwon was given a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/court-denies-do-kwon-appeal-upholds-jail-sentence/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">four-month sentence</a> in Montenegro for using a fake passport which eventually commenced in November 2023. According to<a href="https://www.vijesti.me/vijesti/crna-hronika/699353/do-kvona-pustaju-iz-zatvora-ali-ne-smije-da-napusti-crnu-goru" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> local media Vijesti,</a> this prison time has been served with the South Korean citizen set to be released on March 23, 2024. </p>
<p>However, an order from the High Court of Podgorica directing the seizure of Do Kwon’s valid travel documents will prevent the wanted crypto figure from leaving Montenegrin borders for the time being. This is quite unsurprising as Do Kwon is expected to be extradited to South Korea to face fraud allegations for his involvement in the Terra blockchain project.</p>
<p>The Asian nation had initially contested with the US for the custody of the former Terraform boss, with both parties filing extradition requests following Do Kwon’s arrest in Montenegro. After a series of court proceedings over the last few months, South Korea <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/montenegro-orders-do-kwon-extradition-to-s-korea/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">finally secured</a> the custody of the Terra Luna founder on the basis of filing an extradition request earlier than the US. However, recent developments reveal the extradition process may be stalled for the time being.</p>

<h2>Montenegro&#8217;s Apex Court Postpones Do Kwon’s Extradition Indefinitely </h2>
<p>In an unexpected turnout, the Supreme Court of Montenegro <a href="https://sudovi.me/vrhs/sadrzaj/ONBM" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">has ordered</a> a halt to the extradition of Do Kwon to South Korea pending its decision on a petition from the national prosecutors&#8217; office. </p>
<p>On March 20, the Supreme State Prosecutor’s Office of Montenegro filed a request for protection of legality regarding the decision on the extradition request process by a lower court. The prosecutors argued there were procedural errors in the handling of the case by the appellate court. </p>
<p>Specifically, the prosecutors believe that the appellate court acted beyond its authority by rejecting an appeal from Kwon&#8217;s legal team, asserting that only Montenegro&#8217;s Supreme Court has the jurisdiction to make such legal decisions. Therefore, the Council of the Supreme Court will evaluate whether there were indeed procedural violations and whether the lower court&#8217;s decision regarding Kwon&#8217;s extradition was legally sound, which will determine if the approved transfer will follow through.</p>

<title>Solana Meme Coin Mania Breaks Records: DEX Volume Surges, Yet Failed Transactions Hit 72%</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/solana-meme-coin-mania-breaks-records/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/solana-meme-coin-mania-breaks-records/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。Solana（SOL）和其基于的meme币经历了惊人的增长，其中SOL的YTD增长率达到652%。然而，meme币的激增也给网络带来了挑战，包括交易失败、交易费用上涨以及机器人活动的盛行。此外，文章还介绍了Solana与以太坊（ETH）的竞争以及投资者对Solana的持续兴趣。当前SOL的价格为171.80美元，并且在过去7天中持续下跌。 <div>
<p>Solana (SOL) has experienced an exceptional uptrend, with a staggering year-to-date (YTD) surge of 652%. However, the recent surge in meme coins has further amplified the blockchain&#8217;s growth narrative. </p>
<p>Solana-based tokens such as dogfight (WIF), Bonk Inu (BONK), and Boof of Meme (BOME) have witnessed remarkable growth rates of 574%, 3200%, and 49%, respectively, according to CoinGecko <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/solana-meme-coins" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">data</a>. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, this unprecedented meme coin mania has its fair share of ramifications, including increased transaction failures, rising transaction fees, and the dominance of bot-driven activities.</p>
<h2>Meme Coin Ecosystem Faces Challenges</h2>
<p>The surge in meme coin popularity is evident through the rise in decentralized exchange (DEX) and meme coin volume on Solana. On March 16th, major meme coins like BONK, WIF, TREMP, BODEN, and BOME recorded a cumulative volume of $1.33 billion. </p>
<p>This surge in <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-defi-tvl-rockets-80-impact-on-sol-price/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">trading activity</a> highlights investors&#8217; significant interest and participation in the Solana meme coin ecosystem.</p>
<p>However, the influx of bots seeking to exploit potential opportunities has resulted in a notable increase in failed transactions within the Solana network. </p>

<p>On-chain researcher and analyst Tom Wan <a href="https://x.com/tomwanhh/status/1770513464659735019?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reveals </a>that 72% of the failed transactions can be attributed to bot activities. Although this high failure rate has impacted the network&#8217;s efficiency, the effect on organic users has been relatively less severe than bots.</p>
<img alt="Solana" class="size-large wp-image-288987" height="366" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GJIcI1lWoAA5imc.jpeg?w=980&#038;resize=980%2C366" width="980" />
<p>However, as the meme coin frenzy continues to grip Solana, the network has witnessed a substantial increase in average transaction fees. </p>
<p>While average users can still execute transactions without paying priority fees, Tom Wan highlights that the median <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-meme-coin-trader/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">transaction fee</a> has tripled from 0.000005 SOL to 0.000016 SOL. As a result, the average transaction fee has risen to $0.065, reflecting increased demand and congestion on the network.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the surge in meme coin trading activity on Solana has brought benefits and challenges. While the DEX and meme coin volume growth signifies the increasing adoption and interest in these tokens, it has also exposed vulnerabilities within the network. </p>
<h2>Solana Surpasses All Other Blockchain Ecosystems</h2>
<p>The competition between <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-ceo-predicts-sec-setback-in-ethereum-case/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ethereum </a>(ETH) and Solana continues to intensify, as the so-called &#8220;Ethereum Killer&#8221; appears to be the latest to dominate global investor interest, outpacing other blockchain ecosystems. </p>
<p>According to recent <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/most-popular-blockchain-ecosystems" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">research </a>by CoinGecko, Solana&#8217;s growing popularity can be attributed to its recent rally, which has propelled it to reclaim its 2021 highs. </p>
<p>This resurgence has captured the attention of investors worldwide, who are drawn to blockchain&#8217;s potential for innovation and growth. In addition, the success of notable projects within the Solana ecosystem, such as Pyth, has further boosted investor confidence and interest in the platform.</p>
<img alt="Solana" class="size-large wp-image-288986" height="318" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot_86.jpg?w=665&#038;resize=665%2C318" width="665" />
<p>While Solana has emerged as the most popular blockchain ecosystem, Ethereum holds a significant position in the industry. CoinGecko&#8217;s data reveals that Ethereum captures 12.7% of investor interest, ranking it as the second most popular ecosystem 2024. </p>
<p>According to the research, Ethereum&#8217;s continued relevance can be attributed to its well-established presence and familiarity among investors. However, attention within the Ethereum ecosystem is increasingly dispersed to layer 2 solutions built on top of the Ethereum network.</p>

<p>With a 5.4% share of investor interest year-to-date (YTD), the third most popular blockchain ecosystem is crypto exchange <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binances-4-3b-settlement-marks-crucial-shift/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Binance&#8217;s </a>BNB Smart Chain ecosystem. </p>
<img alt="Solana" class="size-large" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/b6VnbASq/" width="1815" />
<p>Currently, the price of SOL stands at $171.80, reflecting a continuation of its price correction over the past seven days, which amounts to a 5% decline. This correction has also persisted over the past 24 hours, with a further decrease of 6.6% in price.</p>

<title>Is Your Crypto Safe? Trezor Addresses Concerns Over Hack, Claims “Sophisticated Phishing Scam”</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/is-your-crypto-safe-trezor-addresses-concerns-over-hack-claims-sophisticated-phishing-scam/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/is-your-crypto-safe-trezor-addresses-concerns-over-hack-claims-sophisticated-phishing-scam/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。<br />3月19日，Trezor的社交媒体账户遭受了黑客攻击，暴露了20万关注者，引发了一场虚假加密货币预售骗局。黑客利用精心设计的网络钓鱼攻击窃取了8000美元价值的加密资产。Trezor公司表示他们的安全措施仍然牢固，而事件的发生是由于一场精心策划的网络钓鱼攻击。虽然攻击者企图进行大规模盗窃，但由于加密社区的监控和误操作的特点，被成功阻止。 <div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On March 19, Trezor’s X suffered a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/trezor-alerts-66000-users-to-risk-of-phishing/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">security breach</a> that exposed the account’s 200,000 followers to a fake crypto presale. After the alarms were raised, most crypto users stayed vigilant while the hardware wallet company regained control.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Trezor’s team recently published a preliminary report addressing the concerns. The post also explained the elaborate phishing scam that bypassed the company’s security measures.</p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Is Trezor’s “Unwavering Security” Still Protecting Your Crypto?</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">After gaining control of the account, the hacker <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1770225097552363795?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1770225097552363795%7Ctwgr%5Ed4397b1156b69bcb1b5b5db472759fc1be8caf10%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newsbtc.com%2Fnews%2Ftrezor-x-account-hacked-how-much-was-taken-in-the-fake-crypto-presale%2F" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">posted</a> a fake presale address for a $TRZR token. Disguised as an “initiative” to help the Slerf community, the post offered a “separate bonus airdrop” from a website linked in the post that redirected to a wallet drainer.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">After Trezor regained control of the account, X users expressed their worries about the incident and suggested that the hack was a “bad look” on the security-focused company. However, the company guaranteed that they had “robust security measures.”</p>
<blockquote><p>We want to clarify that we do not make use of SMS for 2FA, and instead employ more secure methods of authentication.</p></blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The company finally <a href="https://blog.trezor.io/update-addressing-concerns-around-our-recent-x-twitter-account-breach-a888bc349007" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">addressed</a> users’ concerns in a preliminary report. The hack is possible due to a “sophisticated phishing scam” instead of a lack of basic security measures.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The company is based on “unwavering security,” the post states; as such, all products and internal systems remain unaffected despite the breach.</p>
<p><img alt="Trezor, crypto hack" class="size-large wp-image-288963 aligncenter" height="225" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Captura-de-Pantalla-2024-03-22-a-las-11.55.14-a.-m.png?w=980&#038;resize=980%2C225" width="980" /></p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Sophisticated Phishing Scam Steals Pocket Change</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">According to Trezor, the ongoing investigation has revealed that “the breach appears to have arisen from a sophisticated and calculated phishing attack that was in the works for weeks.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/over-2-6m-stolen-in-phishing-scam-involving-top-crypto-trader/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">calculated scheme</a> began on February 29 after the attacker posed for a “credible entity” from the crypto industry. At the time of writing, the identity of the impersonated figure was not revealed.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The attacker contacted Trezor’s PR team through X using a “well-crafted social media presence.” The seemingly genuine contact aimed to schedule an interview with the company’s CEO.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">According to the report, the attacker and the team had a back-and-forth conversation over several days, which made the efforts to stage a call seem more credible. However, the call agreement led to the click of the link that granted access to Trezor’s X account.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The malicious link was disguised as a Calendly invite that, upon clicking, redirected a Trezor’s team member to a page requesting the X login credentials. The team rescheduled the call as the incident raised red flags.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">During the rescheduled call, the attacker pretended to have technical issues and urged Trezor’s team member “to ‘authorize’ joining the call.” This authorization connected the hacker’s Calendly app with the company’s <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/microstrategy-x-account-hacked/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">X account</a>. As a result, the attacker gained access to the account and published the now-deleted posts.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">he got a whopping 0.96 Solana as well <a href="https://t.co/zqHjxM8EOI" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/zqHjxM8EOI</a></p>
<p>&mdash; xc (@Theft) <a href="https://twitter.com/Theft/status/1770237549547802922?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">March 19, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The hacker only stole $8,100 from the malicious link redirecting to the wallet drainer.  Impressively, just 0.96 SOL (around $162,4 at writing time’s pricing) were sent to the fake presale address.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Undoubtedly, the attack was a calculated and elaborate scheme that aimed to become a big heist. However, the hacker’s attempt was halted by the crypto community surveillance and the suspicious nature of the unauthorized posts.</p>

<title>Spot Bitcoin ETF Issuer WisdomTree Receives Approval For Crypto App Launch In New York</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/wisdomtree-receives-approval-for-crypto-app-launch/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/wisdomtree-receives-approval-for-crypto-app-launch/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。WisdomTree获得了纽约州金融服务部（NYDFS）的信托公司特许经营权，允许其提供数字资产的托管服务，并发行和交易DFS批准的稳定币。该公司计划在纽约推出数字资产应用程序，并提供金币和美元币等产品。该特许经营权使WisdomTree能够提供符合最高合规标准的数字化产品和服务。他们也计划在未来在传统金融和区块链技术领域发挥重要作用。 <div>
<p>In a significant development, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) manager WisdomTree, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240322928015/en/WisdomTree-Granted-Trust-Company-Charter-by-New-York-State-Department-of-Financial-Services-DFS-WisdomTree-Prime" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">has been granted</a> a trust company charter by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), marking another regulatory victory for the company following its <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/breaking-spot-bitcoin-etfs-approved-by-us-sec/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">ETF approval</a> by the US Securities and Exchange Commission on January 10. </p>
<p>This regulatory win allows the company to operate as a limited-purpose trust company under the New York Banking Law, clearing the path for the asset manager to launch its highly anticipated crypto app in New York.</p>
<h2>WisdomTree Receives NYDFS Trust Company Charter</h2>
<p>The NYDFS trust company charter authorizes WisdomTree to provide fiduciary custody services for digital assets, including digital wallet services. The firm is also authorized to issue and exchange DFS-approved stablecoins and manage <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/wisdomtree-files-for-an-ethereum-etf-with-the-sec/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">stablecoin reserves</a>. </p>

<p>Jonathan Steinberg, the Founder and CEO of WisdomTree, expressed the significance of the NYDFS approval, stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>The New York State Department of Financial Services is the premier regulator for businesses that engage in digital asset activity. This well-established trust company charter program – which long predates digital assets – is based on bank-grade regulation, allowing us to offer products that capitalize on innovation without sacrificing customer protection. </p></blockquote>
<p>Steinberg further emphasized that this approval not only positions the company to participate in New York&#8217;s “rapidly growing” <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/these-new-spot-bitcoin-etfs-now-hold-nearly-of-btc/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">digital asset marketplace</a> but also equips the asset manager to lead the industry&#8217;s evolution in the future.</p>
<h2>Tokenized Gold And Dollar Assets</h2>
<p>According to the announcement, under the umbrella of WisdomTree Prime, the firm&#8217;s digital trust will initially offer products to customers. These include the Gold Token and the WisdomTree Dollar Token, which will be available within the Prime ecosystem. </p>
<p>The company will also maintain reserves for these assets under the framework approved by the NYDFS. Furthermore, the trust company charter enables WisdomTree to provide New York retail <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/evaluating-performance-bitcoin-etfs-since-launch/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">customers </a>with access to WisdomTree Prime, which is expected to be available in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Will Peck, Head of Digital Assets at WisdomTree and CEO of WisdomTree Digital Trust Company, LLC, highlighted the compliance standards upheld by the company, stating: </p>
<blockquote><p>Held to the highest compliance standards in the industry, a New York limited-purpose trust company provides the leading platform to offer regulated tokenized products and services to WisdomTree&#8217;s retail and institutional customers. </p></blockquote>
<p>WisdomTree&#8217;s grant of the trust company charter by the NYDFS signifies a significant step forward in its mission to provide new and regulated financial services in the digital asset space. </p>
<p>With the imminent launch of its <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etf-these-9-new-participants-accumulated/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">crypto app</a>, the digital asset manager aims to play a pivotal role at the intersection of traditional finance and blockchain technology, improving access to digital assets for retail and institutional clients.</p>

<title>Will Shiba Inu Outperform Dogecoin In 2024 As The Top Meme Coin?</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-outperform-dogecoin/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-outperform-dogecoin/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章比较了2024年狗狗币和SHIB狗狗币的价格表现，指出SHIB在年初表现更出色。虽然SHIB价格波动更大，但仍在竞争中处于领先地位。SHIB利用狗狗币的影响力，也通过市场推广成功吸引关注。两者之间的竞争仍在继续，SHIB试图取代狗狗币。目前，狗狗币的市值为228亿美元，领先于SHIB的160亿美元。 <div>
<p class="p2">As the crypto bull market rolls around once more, top meme coins Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have started vying for the position of best performer once again. The year 2024, despite only being three months in, has already been incredibly interesting in this regard as both <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-23-5-million-shiba-inu/">meme coins</a> rally to new yearly highs.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Dogecoin Vs. Shiba Inu Price Performance</h2>
<p class="p2">Taking the year 2024 into account, it seems that Shiba Inu is finally winning the top <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-coinbase-futures-listing/">meme coin</a> battle against Dogecoin. A comparison of prices at the start of the year and now shows that Dogecoin has performed poorly compared to Shiba Inu.</p>

<p class="p2">To put this in perspective, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-23-5-million-shiba-inu/">Shiba Inu price</a> started out the year around $0.000009 and then surged more than 400% in March to $0.000044. The price has since retraced since this and returned to the $0.000027 level where it is currently trading now, still a more than 150% increase from where it started the year.</p>
<p class="p2">In comparison, the Dogecoin price started 2024 at around $0.08 and then rallied to $0.2 in March. This is less than a 300% increase in the same time period in comparison to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-latest-shib-magazine/">SHIB</a>. Then, just like SHIB, the DOGE price has retraced some of its gains and is now trading at $0.15, which is around a 100% increase from where it began the year.</p>
<p class="p2">However, when it comes to holding up during a downtrend, DOGE has proven to be the better performer. This is because while Shiba Inu has seen its price fall around 50% from its March highs, the DOGE price has only seen a 25% decline. This suggests that Shiba Inu is the much more volatile option, thus making it more likely to move up faster than Dogecoin. But it also means that the price of SHIB is more likely to crash rapidly compared to the more stable DOGE.</p>
<h2 class="p2">The Rivalry Between SHIB And DOGE</h2>
<p class="p2">The rivalry between Shiba Inu and Dogecoin goes right back to the launch of SHIB in 2020. SHIB adopted the Shiba Inu dog which is the face of Dogecoin, and after the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-shiba-inu-updates/">DOGE price</a> rallied in 2021 due to billionaire Elon Musk’s influencer, SHIB’s position as the “Dogecoin killer” became more prominent.</p>
<p class="p2">This piggybacking of the already popular Shiba Inu dog breed made popular by <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-when-dogecoin-does-this/">DOGE</a>, as well as a very clever marketing campaign of sending half the total supply to Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, who proceeded to burn the majority of it, propelled the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-23-5-million-shiba-inu/">SHIB</a> price and brought it into the limelight.</p>

<p class="p2">Even now, this rivalry continues to wax stronger, with the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-latest-shib-magazine/">Shiba Inu team</a> threatening to dethrone Dogecoin as the leading meme coin. In an X post, the Shiba Inu team <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-shiba-inu-updates/">boasted</a> that the end was close for Dogecoin. The post hinted at major updates coming for the SHIB ecosystem that will help to solidify its position as the leading meme coin.</p>
<p class="p2">Nevertheless, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-coinbase-futures-listing/">Dogecoin remains the leading meme coin</a> for now with a market cap of $22.8 billion. This puts it ahead of Shiba Inu which is the second-largest meme coin with a market cap of $16 billion.</p>

<title>Big Money Eyes Dogecoin: Whale Activity Explodes 600%</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/big-money-eyes-dogecoin-whale-activity-explodes-600/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/big-money-eyes-dogecoin-whale-activity-explodes-600/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。最近一个月，Dogecoin区块链上的鲸鱼相关活动出现了急剧增长，鲸鱼交易数量增加了600%。这表明大额交易者对这种狗狗币的兴趣很高。这种活动可能导致价格波动，但方向无法确定。当前Dogecoin价格在0.15美元左右，过去一周下跌超过6%。 <div>
<p>On-chain data shows whale-related activity on the Dogecoin blockchain has registered a sharp 600% increase over the past month.</p>
<h2>Dogecoin Whale Transactions Have Exploded In The Last Month</h2>
<p>According to data from the market intelligence platform <a href="https://twitter.com/intotheblock/status/1770791562793914393" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">IntoTheBlock</a>, DOGE whales have become quite active recently. The on-chain indicator of interest here is the Transaction Count of transfers on the Dogecoin blockchain with a value of at least $1 million.</p>
<p>Generally, only the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/1-5-billion-bitcoin-leaves-coinbase-bullish-signal/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">whale</a> entities are capable of moving such large amounts with single transactions, so these transactions are attributed to involving these humongous investors.</p>

<p>As such, the total number of transactions taking place on the network every day that are of a size falling in this range can provide us with hints about the behavior of the whales.</p>
<p>When the value of the Transaction Count of moves of this size is high, the whales actively participate in the network. Such a trend implies that interest around the memecoin may be high among these large traders.</p>
<p>On the other hand, low values of the indicator suggest not many large transactions are happening on the blockchain, a potential indication that the whales aren&#8217;t paying attention to the cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Dogecoin Transaction Count for the whales over the past month:</p>
<p><img alt="Dogecoin Whale Transaction Count" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="432" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GJMb0xXW4AAcExa?format=jpg&amp;name=large" width="1690" /></p>

<p>As the above graph shows, this Dogecoin indicator has recently registered a sharp uptrend. &#8220;The number of DOGE transactions larger than $1 million increased by more than 600% in the last 30 days!&#8221; notes IntoTheBlock.</p>
<p>The analytics firm has also shared a zoomed-out view of the chart for the same metric, which puts into perspective the scale of the recent DOGE whale activity.</p>
<p><img alt="Dogecoin Activity" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="283" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GJMdXqCWoAE8hV2?format=jpg&amp;name=large" width="1685" /></p>

<p>It would appear that the recent levels of the Transaction Count of the Dogecoin whales have been the highest that the network has witnessed since May 2021, when DOGE hit its <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-supply-in-profit-nears-95-top-signal/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">top</a>.</p>
<p>What does the high whale activity mean for the memecoin&#8217;s price? Generally, it&#8217;s hard to say anything about a price outcome based on the Transaction Count of these humongous entities alone, given that both selling and buying transfers count equally in the metric.</p>
<p>What the indicator&#8217;s trend can say, though, is whether the asset is likely to see more <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-exchange-outflows-inflows-highs-volatility/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">volatility</a> in the near future. A large number of whale transactions means a significant shift of volume in the market, which can naturally produce some noticeable fluctuations in the price.</p>

<p>As Dogecoin has been going through high whale activity recently, it may see more volatile price action soon, should whales continue to remain active. However, the direction of this volatility can theoretically take the memecoin in either direction.</p>
<h2>DOGE Price</h2>
<p>When writing, Dogecoin is floating around the $0.15 mark, down more than 6% over the past week.</p>

<title>Shiba Inu To The Moon: Crypto Analyst Predicts 300% Surge For SHIB</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-surge-crypto-shib/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-surge-crypto-shib/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。Pseudonymous预测今年将发生显著价格飙升，提供了投资者在交易中获利的机会。他认为Shiba Inu可能在年底前涨幅达到300%，建议在0.00002249的水平作为入场点。分析人员预测SHIB可能在7月达到新的历史最高水平，并可能继续上涨。当前SHIB的价格为$0.00002794。 <div>
<p>Pseudonymous <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/crypto-expert-bitcoin-500000/#:~:text=Bullish%20Sentiment%20Shows%20Bitcoin%20Can%20Reach%20%24500%2C000&amp;text=On%20the%20road%20to%20%24500%2C000,BTC%20corrects%2020%25%20or%20more." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">crypto analyst and trader Xanrox</a> has predicted a significant price surge that could happen for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-23-5-million-shiba-inu/">Shiba Inu (SHIB)</a> this year. The crypto trader also provided an opportunity for investors to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-investing-meme-coins/">profit from this move</a>, as he stated an entry point for those interested in getting on the trade. </p>
<h2>Shiba Inu To See A 300% Gain Before Year-end</h2>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/chart/SHIBUSDT/BzRa6PlA-SHIBA-Buy-here-do-not-miss-next-pump-HUGE/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">recent analysis</a>, Xanrox expressed his bullishness on SHIB and stated that the “next profit target is 300% away.” He further asserted that the meme coin would “definitely go higher later this year” and that what was important was to catch the “bounce and ride the next wave to the upside.”</p>

<p>Looking at SHIB’s chart, the crypto analyst noted that the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-161800-target-fibonacci-elliott-wave-theory/">0.618 Fibonacci retracement</a> at 0.00002249 looks like a great level to invest in the crypto token. He added that an <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/can-elliott-waves-really-predict-price-bitcoin/">Elliot Wave technical analysis</a> is also important for such big moves to get an idea of the full picture. That way, one can see the “full market structure and map of the uptrend.” </p>
<p>Therefore, Xanrox suggested that investors wait for a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-bull-run-bull-flag-formed/#:~:text=XRP%20Bull%20Run%20Confirmed%3A%20Largest%20Bull%20Flag%20In%20Crypto%20History%20Just%20Formed,-by%20Scott%20Matherson&amp;text=XRP%20could%20well%20be%20on,this%20is%20on%20the%20horizon." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">bullish flag</a> or pattern or simply set their limit order to buy SHIB lower. This bullish pattern seemed to form not long after as the crypto trader provided further updates in his analysis, noting that SHIB only had one resistance on the way, and that level was at its current all-time high (ATH) of $0.00008845. </p>
<p>As part of his update, Xanrox also mentioned an entry point for those looking to benefit from this move to the upside. He directed <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-top-5-private-holders/">investors</a> to load up their coins at 0.0000212995, suggesting that the 300% move would start from there.</p>
<h2>Shiba Inu Could Hit New ATH By July</h2>
<p>From the accompanying chart Xanrox shared, he hinted at SHIB rising to as high as $0.00008854 by July. That would see the meme coin <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-dogecoin-shib-excitement/">set a new ATH</a> with its current ATH at $0.00008845. SHIB&#8217;s rise to that price level might just be the beginning of its run in this market cycle, as other analysts have predicted that the meme coin could delete another zero.</p>

<p>One of these analysts is Javon Marks, who <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/crypto-analyst-shiba-inu-target/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">predicts</a> that SHIB hitting the $0.000081 price range could set the stage for a further rise to $0.0001553. In the meantime, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-active-addresses-soar-over-170/">SHIB investors</a> will have their eyes on <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-price-surge-0-000052/">crypto analyst Ali Martinez’s prediction</a> that the meme coin could rise to $0.000052. </p>
<p>At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.00002794, up over 3% in the last 24 hours according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/shiba-inu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">data</a> from CoinMarketCap.</p>

<title>Chainlink Flips Cardano To Become #1 Crypto In This Metric</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/chainlink-flips-cardano-to-become-1-crypto-metric/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/chainlink-flips-cardano-to-become-1-crypto-metric/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。据数据显示，Chainlink（LINK）已超过Cardano（ADA），成为加密货币项目中的王者。根据开发活动指标，Chainlink目前是开发活动最多的加密货币项目。开发活动指标跟踪开发人员在项目的GitHub存储库上的工作量。Chainlink在过去30天内观察到超过451个事件，超过了ADA的445个事件。开发活动增加通常表明项目的开发人员对项目有承诺。虽然Chainlink的开发活动排名提升，但与价格并无直接关联。当前Chainlink的价格约为18美元，过去一周下跌了7%。 <div>
<p>Data shows that Chainlink (LINK) has surpassed Cardano (ADA) in becoming the king of cryptocurrency projects in this metric.</p>
<h2>Chainlink Is Now Top Of The Sector In Development Activity</h2>
<p>In a new post on X, the analytics firm <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1770889841578012944" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Santiment</a> has shared the latest ranking for various cryptocurrency projects based on the criterion of &#8220;<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/internet-computer-icp-breaks-dev-activity-top-mean/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">development activity</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>This metric keeps track of the total work the developers of any given coin have been doing on the project&#8217;s public GitHub repository.</p>

<p>To measure this work, Santiment&#8217;s indicator uses the concept of &#8220;events.&#8221; An event refers to the developer&#8217;s action on the cryptocurrency&#8217;s repository.</p>
<p>These events aren&#8217;t the same as &#8220;commits,&#8221; which are records of changes made to the repo&#8217;s code. The analytics firm has chosen this methodology rather than simply measuring the number of GitHub commits themselves because the latter can sometimes prove to be inaccurate.</p>
<p>This is because when a project is forked (that is, a clone of it is created up to a certain point), the commits of the original project are inherited by the newer one. These commits, though, are not proof of the work done by the fork&#8217;s developers.</p>
<p>Events circumvent this issue by counting the forking as a whole as just a single event, with the events of the past project not carrying over, thus providing a truer picture of the developer&#8217;s work.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our platform pulls notable GitHub activity from project repositories via a back-tested process to ensure only the team&#8217;s significant efforts to innovate and improve are included,&#8221; notes Santiment.</p>
<p>Now, here is a table that shows how the top 10 projects are looking like right now based on their respective development activities over the past 30 days:</p>
<p><img alt="Chainlink Vs Cardano Development Activity" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="1600" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GJN0fyjbsAAALzp?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096" width="2368" /></p>

<p>As is visible above, Chainlink has improved its standing and has surpassed <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-1800-price-explosion-12/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Cardano</a> to become the top asset in this metric. The gap between the two, though, isn&#8217;t that much currently, as LINK has seen over 451 events in the past 30 days, while ADA has observed almost 445.</p>
<p>Polkadot (DOT) and Kusama (KSM), who used to be at the top fighting with ADA for the first position, appear to have fallen off, as they are now sixth and seventh, respectively.</p>
<p>Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency based on market cap, has also improved its development activity rank this month, though it&#8217;s still just the ninth-placed asset in this metric.</p>
<p>As for what Chainlink&#8217;s surge to the top of the development activity list might mean, the answer is that it usually doesn&#8217;t directly correlate to the price.</p>

<p>What it shows, however, is that the developers of the project are committed to it, which can be one of the signs to look for when estimating whether a project will be around in the long term or not.</p>
<h2>LINK Price</h2>
<p>When writing, Chainlink is trading around $18, down 7% over the past week.</p>

<title>Renowned Finance Author Reveals Why You Should Buy As Much Bitcoin As You Can</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/buy-much-bitcoin-as-you-can/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/buy-much-bitcoin-as-you-can/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章从作者基于Real Asset的建议开始，强调了投资者应该集中精力积累比特币。作者批评了中国政府为了稳定经济而购买股票的做法，并建议投资者在当前经济不适宜传统投资的情况下，将重点转向黄金、白银和比特币。另外，文章指出了比特币稀缺性的优势，作者称赞比特币为一种独特的投资机会。 <div>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/author-says-you-should-buy-bitcoin/">Robert Kiyosaki</a>, the author renowned for his best-selling book “Rich Dad Poor Dad” has identified <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/robert-kiyosaki-avocates-bitcoin-investment/">Bitcoin</a> as a real-world asset, urging investors and the broader crypto community to shift their focus from stock investments and prioritize accumulating Bitcoin. </p>
<h2>Buy More Bitcoin Before It’s Too Late</h2>
<p>In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, Kiyosaki <a href="https://x.com/therealkiyosaki/status/1770591463895691390?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">advised</a> investors to focus on stacking up more Bitcoin now more than ever. Citing the dilemma <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/china-bitcoin-ban-backfires-86b-crypto-volume-soars/">China’s stock market</a> currently faces, the finance expert has suggested that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/robert-kiyosaki-safeguard-your-wealth-with-bitcoin/">investors seize the opportunity to buy as much Bitcoin</a> as they can afford before “the biggest bubble in history goes bust.”</p>

<p>Kiyosaki has claimed that China is in “trouble” because the government had borrowed funds to buy more stocks to potentially <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-expert-forecasts-us-stock-market-bitcoin/">inflate the stock market</a> artificially and stabilize the country’s economic challenges. The finance author criticized China’s decision, labeling it as a “Foolish” and “Desperate” attempt. </p>
<p>According to the author, the problem’s root lies in a global decline in consumer spending. He advised against investing in stocks and bonds at this pivotal time, <a href="https://x.com/therealkiyosaki/status/1767054547942580480?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">arguing</a> that the stock market was <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/r-kiyosaki-reiterates-bitcoin-potential-amid-greatest-crash-warning/">set to crash</a> and the current economic situation was not conducive for traditional investments.</p>
<p>Instead, he recommends investing in real assets such as gold, silver and Bitcoin, which are historically <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-will-bloom-in-higher-inflation-environment/">considered safe havens</a> in times of economic uncertainty. </p>
<p>Supporting the declaration to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-this-is-the-best-time-to-buy-btc/">buy more BTC</a>, popular crypto analyst and BTC enthusiast, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-pundit-issues-bold-declaration/">Michael van de Poppe</a> agreed to Kiyosaki’s advice, albeit with a time limit of two years. Poppe <a href="https://x.com/cryptomichnl/status/1770592410277441603?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">revealed</a> that following the anticipated crypto bubble, typically debt collapses and liquidity flows back into the dollar and other fiat currencies.</p>
<p>This scenario often leads to a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/why-the-philippines-is-embracing-cryptocurrency/">currency devaluation</a> and a subsequent rise in the stock market. He suggests that investors capitalize on <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/founder-btc-bitcoin-bull-run-just-getting-started/">Bitcoin’s current bullish momentum</a> by acquiring more of the cryptocurrency. However, he also underscored the value of diversifying investments into the stock market as Bitcoin’s bullish trends fade. </p>
<h2>Finance Guru Praises BTC&#8217;s Fixed Supply</h2>
<p>In another X post, Kiyosaki <a href="https://x.com/therealkiyosaki/status/1768389895649927266?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">lauded praises</a> for Bitcoin, describing the cryptocurrency as a unique investment opportunity due to its <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-supply-in-profit-nears-95-top-signal/">fixed supply</a>. As a popular Bitcoin advocate, Kiyosaki is renowned for his preference for investing in tangible assets such as gold, silver and BTC. </p>

<p>According to the finance guru, there were certain drawbacks involved in <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/gold-out-bitcoin-in-etf-investors-flock-to-btc/">investing in gold</a> and silver, noting that as the prices of these assets grow, their supply also increases. However, the reverse was the case for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-reaches-trillion-dollar-valuation-how-it-stacks-up-to-stocks-gold-more/">Bitcoin</a>, as the cryptocurrency has a predetermined maximum supply of 21 million coins. </p>
<p>This scarcity is a key factor driving Kiyosaki’s appreciation for the world’s largest cryptocurrency, as it implies that no matter how <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/crypto-fever-bitcoin-smashes-records-approaching-73000-milestone/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">high the price of Bitcoin goes</a>, the total supply will remain limited.</p>

<title>Are Spot Bitcoin ETF Buyers “Noobs” And Panic Selling?</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/spot-bitcoin-etf-noobs-panic-selling/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/spot-bitcoin-etf-noobs-panic-selling/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。文章指出，一些投资者在_spot Bitcoin ETF_市场表现得像菜鸟，当价格下跌时，他们选择赎回股份并自行保管加密货币，而不是让发行人通过其合作伙伴控制私钥。此外，Grayscale和其他发行人从他们的持仓中减少了超过7亿美元。总体而言，BTC仍然低于7万美元，面临压力。 <div>
<p>Billions have been channeled to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) after the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gave the green light in mid-January. However, on-chain analysis indicates that some of these spot ETF investors might, after all, be less experienced than initially assumed.</p>
<h2>Spot Bitcoin ETF Investors Acting Like &#8220;Noobs&#8221;?</h2>
<p>Taking to X, Willy Woo, an on-chain analyst, <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1771016255866290577" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">shared</a> the Bitcoin Network Flows data and picked out crucial leads to suggest that some spot Bitcoin ETFs are shaken out too quickly by the market. </p>
<img alt="Bitcoin Network Flows | Source: Willy Woo on X" class="size-full wp-image-288933" height="753" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GJPoHxcbwAATgdX.jpg?resize=1024%2C753" width="1024" />
<p>In a post, Woo pointed to a $1.6 billion outflow from spot Bitcoin ETFs when prices crashed on March 5. During this dip, the network had inflows worth $1.1 billion. This outflow from spot Bitcoin ETFs and a marked influx of cash to the mainnet could mean that some investors choose to redeem and get hold of the underlying coin, explaining the capital injection. </p>

<p>Spot Bitcoin ETFs offer a simple and accessible route to Bitcoin investment. Unlike futures-based ETFs, which speculate on future prices, spot Bitcoin ETFs track the price of Bitcoin directly. This means investors can gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of buying and holding the coins themselves. </p>
<p>All they need to do is purchase shares of spot Bitcoin ETFs from issuers like <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/north-koreas-eth-transfer-to-blackrock-via-tornado/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">BlackRock</a>. A specific amount of Bitcoin backs each purchase.</p>
<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/x/ixE5IevA/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Bitcoin price trending upward on the weekly chart | Source: BTCUSDT on Binance, TradingView" class="size-full" height="904" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/ixE5IevA/" width="1787" /></a>
<p>However, as on-chain data shows, by redeeming their shares when prices fell, investors choose to self-custody their coins instead of allowing the issuer, through its partners, to control their coin&#8217;s private keys. United States SEC filings show that most ETF issuers rely on Coinbase Custody as their primary custodian.</p>
<p> This regulated third party safeguards billions worth of Bitcoin backing each share of spot Bitcoin ETF in circulation.</p>
<h2>Grayscale Outflows Increasing, BTC Facing Headwinds</h2>
<p>The apparent shakeout and inflow directly into the mainnet as Woo shares appear to confirm previous studies. In a report, CoinDesk noted that a big chunk of early spot Bitcoin ETF demand was likely driven by retailers. </p>

<p>Their investigation found that the average trade size for one ETF hovered around $13,000. This finding reinforces the &#8220;retail investor&#8221; narrative. Even so, the actual purchasers of spot Bitcoin ETFs will be confirmed when made public.</p>
<img alt="Cash flowing to spot BTC ETFs slowing down | Source: Lookonchain on X" class="size-full wp-image-288935" height="768" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GJM8KfHXEAAXBLz.png?resize=1024%2C768" width="1024" />
<p>For now, there is no fresh capital going into spot Bitcoin ETFs. According to Lookonchain <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1770825301594869810" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">data</a> on March 21, Grayscale and the other issuers reduced over $700 million from their holdings. CoinMarketCap data shows that BTC remains below $70,000 and is under pressure.</p>

<title>Urgent Alert For Apple Mac Users: Your Cryptos Could Be At Risk</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/urgent-alert-apple-mac-crypto-at-risk/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/urgent-alert-apple-mac-crypto-at-risk/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。苹果M系列处理器中发现的漏洞可能会对加密货币用户产生严重影响，可能危及加密数字资产的安全。漏洞源于芯片的数据内存相关预取器，可泄露在加密操作中使用的秘钥。攻击方法称为“GoFetch”，不需要管理访问权限，可能导致秘钥被泄露。漏洞导致传统加密协议和抗量子计算攻击的算法受到影响。苹果尚未公开回应这一发现，建议用户密切关注解决这一漏洞的软件更新。加密社区面临不确定性和风险。 <div>
<p>A newly identified vulnerability in Apple&#8217;s M-series processors could have dire implications for crypto users, with the potential to compromise the private keys essential for securing digital assets. This flaw, which resides deep within the microarchitecture of these chips, was first <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/03/hackers-can-extract-secret-encryption-keys-from-apples-mac-chips/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reported</a> by Ars Technica and detailed in a paper published by a collective of researchers from top US universities.</p>
<h2>Mac Users Beware: This Is Crucial For Crypto Owners</h2>
<p>The vulnerability stems from a side channel in the chip&#8217;s data memory-dependent prefetcher (DMP), a mechanism designed to enhance computing efficiency. However, this feature inadvertently allows for the extraction of secret keys during cryptographic operations, a process that is fundamental to the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ledger-expose-bitcoins-private-keys-subpoena/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">security of cryptocurrencies</a> and other digital transactions.</p>
<p>&#8220;The DMP [&#8230;] uses the data values in order to make predictions [&#8230;] if a data value &#8216;looks like&#8217; a pointer, it will be treated as an &#8216;address&#8217; [&#8230;] the data from this &#8216;address&#8217; will be brought to the cache, leaking over cache side channels,&#8221; the researchers explained, underscoring the inadvertent risk posed by this hardware optimization.</p>

<p>Dubbed &#8220;GoFetch&#8221; by its discoverers, this attack method does not require administrative access, raising alarms about the ease with which bad actors could exploit this vulnerability.</p>
<p>According to the team, &#8220;We don’t care about the data value being prefetched, but the fact that the intermediate data looked like an address is visible via a cache channel and is sufficient to reveal the secret key over time.&#8221; This discovery is particularly concerning for cryptocurrency holders, as <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/what-are-private-keys-and-why-are-they-important/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">private keys</a> are the linchpin of security for digital wallets and transactions.</p>
<p>The implications of GoFetch are vast, affecting not only traditional encryption protocols but also those designed to be resistant against quantum computing attacks. This puts a wide array of cryptographic keys at risk, including RSA and Diffie-Hellman, along with post-quantum algorithms like Kyber-512 and Dilithium-2.</p>
<p>The researchers reported that &#8220;The GoFetch app requires less than an hour to extract a 2048-bit RSA key and a little over two hours to extract a 2048-bit Diffie-Hellman key,&#8221; highlighting the efficiency and danger of this attack vector.</p>

<p>Mitigation of this vulnerability poses a significant challenge due to its hardware-based nature. While software-based defenses can be developed, they often come at the cost of degraded performance, particularly on devices with older M-series chips.</p>
<p>&#8220;For developers of cryptographic software running on M1 and M2 processors [&#8230;] they will have to employ other defenses, almost all of which come with significant performance penalties,&#8221; the researchers noted, indicating a difficult road ahead for both developers and users.</p>
<p>Apple has yet to make a public statement regarding the GoFetch findings, leaving the tech community and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/macbook-crypto-users-targeted-by-malware-attack/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">crypto users</a> eagerly awaiting a response. In the meantime, the researchers advise end users to look out for software updates that specifically address this vulnerability.</p>
<p>Given the manual and slow process required to assess an implementation&#8217;s vulnerability, the crypto community is faced with a period of uncertainty and heightened risk.</p>
<p>At press time, the Bitcoin price stood at $63,396, down 5.1% in the last 24 hours.</p>

<title>Cardano Founder Charles Hoskinson Unveils Predictions For 2030</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-founder-predictions-2030/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-founder-predictions-2030/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。Cardano创始人预测未来几年计算能力将有重大突破，机器学习模型将比当前强1000倍。他指出，这将需要专用硬件和优化技术。这将使通用PC能够处理以往仅供高性能系统处理的复杂计算任务。此举将大大改善计算能力的可及性，对各行业的应用也将产生深远影响。同时，Cardano的价格预测并未提及，但其他加密货币分析师预计ADA价格将在未来数周内上涨至1.70美元，并有望突破5美元。 <div>
<p>Founder of Cardano, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-founder-declares-crypto-under-attack/">Charles Hoskinson</a> has boldly predicted a revolutionary advancement in the landscape of computational power. His forecast anticipates a remarkable leap forward in <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano/cardano-price-6-5-ath/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">machine learning capabilities</a> in the next few years.</p>
<h2>Machine Learning Breakthrough Expected By 2030</h2>
<p>In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, Hoskinson <a href="https://x.com/iohk_charles/status/1770414805788078439?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">declared</a> that by the end of the decade, it would be possible to run machine learning models 1,000 times more powerful than Mixtral on a standard gaming Personal Computer (PC). The Cardano founder’s statement implies a substantial improvement in the capabilities of handling complex computational tasks in the realm of machine learning and <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/artificial-intelligence-crypto-boom-whats-behind-the-double-digit-surge/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Artificial Intelligence (AI).</a></p>

<p>According to the crypto founder, this technological innovation will only be possible with specialized hardware and optimization techniques. By leveraging these advanced technologies, the computational power of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/the-power-of-seasonality-and-web3-in-video-gaming-a-new-era-of-engagement-and-ownership/">gaming</a> PCs is potentially set to rise to unexpected levels, enabling them to effectively handle tasks previously reserved for high-performance systems. </p>
<p>Hoskinson’s prediction ushers in a potential for improved accessibility to computational power, with its implications becoming far-reaching, as various industries would potentially benefit from its applications. The Cardano founder’s proclamation also comes at a time when <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/coinbase-ai-a-force-in-crypto-sector/">technological innovation and advancement, particularly in the fields of AI</a> and machine learning are growing rapidly. </p>
<p>In the advent that his predictions come to fruition, the boundaries of computational power would effectively be breached, driving innovation on a global scale and unlocking potential benefits that could come from harnessing immense computational power on consumer-grade hardware. </p>
<h2>Cardano Founder Excludes ADA In Projections</h2>
<p>While making his predictions for 2030, Hoskinson failed to provide any personal <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/analyst-predicts-cardano-price-to-skyrocket-by-1400/">projections on the future outlook of Cardano’s native token, ADA</a>. The crypto founder has recently been focusing on the transformative capabilities of Artificial Intelligence and machine learning models within the industry. </p>

<p>At the time of writing the price of ADA is $0.64, marking a 10.05% decline over the past week, according to CoinMarketCap. While other cryptocurrencies like <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-rallies-3550/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Ethereum (ETH)</a> and <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-price-soars-by-11-heres-why/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Solana (SOL)</a> have experienced bullish rallies, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-price-prediction-is-ada-dead-what-are-the-better-options/">ADA has remained relatively subdued.</a></p>
<p>Although Hoskinson has not provided a price forecast for Cardano, other crypto analysts have stepped in to fill the gap. According to popular crypto analyst, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-analyst-sets-5-target-for-cardano-price-how/">Ali Martinez</a>, the price of ADA is expected to reach $1.70 following a period of consolidation between the range of $0.55 to $0.80 in the upcoming weeks.</p>
<p>The crypto analyst has predicted that after the upswing to $1.70, Cardano could experience a significant breakout to $5. This surge would <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano/cardano-ada-eyes-explosive-2000-bull-run-targeting-12-and-quadrupling-ath/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">surpass the cryptocurrency’s previous all-time high</a> of $3.10 in 2021.</p>

<title>EU Parliament Outlaws Anonymous Crypto Payments: Details</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/eu-outlaws-anonymous-crypto-payments-details/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/eu-outlaws-anonymous-crypto-payments-details/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。欧盟议会的主要委员会通过了一项新的立法举措，禁止匿名加密货币支付，引发了激烈的争论和批评。新的立法要求对商业交易中的匿名现金支付进行限制，以及对数字货币支付的追踪和监管。批评者认为这些措施侵犯了个人隐私和自由，同时挑战了法规的有效性和可执行性。加密货币社区对这些新规定做出了批评，指出了对捐赠和货币使用的潜在影响。对于这些规定的实施挑战在于加密货币的去中心化和边境化性质，可能会限制欧盟的监管努力。 <div>
<p>The majority of the EU Parliament’s lead committees approved a new legislative move to ban anonymous crypto payments has ignited a firestorm of debate, marking a pivotal moment in the regulation of digital currencies within the bloc. This comprehensive package of anti-money laundering measures, extending beyond cryptocurrencies to include significant restrictions on cash transactions, represents one of the most assertive regulatory efforts seen in the global financial landscape.</p>
<h2>The Legislative Framework</h2>
<p>Under the new legislation, anonymous cash payments in commercial transactions are limited to amounts under €3,000, with a complete prohibition on cash transactions exceeding €10,000 in business contexts. The legislation casts a wide net over digital financial transactions as well, specifically targeting <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-explores-privacy-pool-system/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">anonymity in crypto</a> payments.</p>
<p>Any transaction involving cryptocurrencies to wallets managed by service providers, known as “<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/regulation-amendments-by-uk-treasury-drops-kyc-restriction-for-non-hosted-wallets/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">hosted wallets</a>,” is now required to be fully traceable, eliminating anonymity for even the smallest transactions.</p>
<p>The EU&#8217;s legislative bodies assert that these measures are critical in the fight against money laundering, financing of terrorism, and tax evasion. However, the sweeping nature of these laws has raised serious concerns about privacy rights and the fundamental freedoms of EU citizens.</p>
<p>MEP Dr. Patrick Breyer of the Pirate Party, a staunch critic of the legislation, has termed the EU&#8217;s approach as &#8220;financial paternalism.&#8221; In a detailed blog post, Breyer vehemently opposes the outright ban on anonymous payments, arguing it does little to curb crime while significantly infringing on personal liberties.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">EU Committee approves:
<img alt="🚫" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f6ab.png" style="height: 1em;" />Prohibition of cash payments over €10,000
<img alt="🆔" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f194.png" style="height: 1em;" />Prohibition of anonymous cash payments over €3,000
₿ Prohibition of anonymous crypto payments to hosted wallets without any threshold</p>
<p>This means war on cash and gradual erosion of our financial freedom!… <a href="https://t.co/gwznD4QZop" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/gwznD4QZop</a></p>
<p>— Patrick Breyer #JoinMastodon (@echo_pbreyer) <a href="https://twitter.com/echo_pbreyer/status/1770853127798861868?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">March 21, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>He asserts, &#8220;Generally prohibiting anonymous payments would at best have minimal effects on crime, but it would deprive innocent citizens of their financial freedom.&#8221; Breyer&#8217;s comments underscore a broader concern among critics that the legislation could disproportionately affect ordinary citizens under the guise of combating illegal activities.</p>

<p>Highlighting the importance of anonymity for political and social activism, Breyer points out, &#8220;The medicines or sex toys I buy is nobody’s business. To collect donations, dissidents such as the late Alexei Navalny and his wife are increasingly reliant on anonymous donations in virtual currencies worldwide.&#8221;</p>
<p>This perspective sheds light on the potential repercussions for privacy and freedom of expression, emphasizing the need for a balanced approach to regulation.</p>
<h2>Crypto Community&#8217;s Reaction</h2>
<p>The crypto sector, known for its emphasis on privacy and decentralization, has responded critically to the EU&#8217;s regulatory measures. Daniel &#8220;Loddi&#8221; Tröster, host of the Sound Money Bitcoin Podcast, <a href="https://twitter.com/18loddi/status/1771072630331785631" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">highlighted</a> the practical challenges and implications of the new laws, particularly focusing on the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-employees-bypass-kyc/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">KYC requirements</a> for transactions to hosted wallets.</p>
<p>“As KYC is required when opening accounts on the crypto exchange anyway, there are no major changes here for the time being (for most providers). However, there are restrictions in other areas. Hosted wallets are likely to include the following: Alby, blink, Wallet of Satoshi…,” he remarked.</p>

<p>These wallets have no KYC thus far. For example, the users of Wallet of Satoshi, have not yet gone through a KYC process. In future, the transfer of Sathois to this wallet would therefore require a KYC process.</p>
<p>Tröster further elaborates on the impact on donations and the broader implications for cryptocurrency use within the EU. &#8220;What initially gives me a lot more &#8216;stomach ache&#8217; are donations. Anyone who wants to donate anonymously can no longer do so with the new regulations,&#8221; he states, articulating concerns over the stifling effect these rules might have.</p>
<p>Notably, self-custody to self-custody transactions are not affected by the new law. “It may have been understood that no prevention/regulation is possible here,” Tröster stated.</p>
Enforcement Challenges
<p>Skeptics of the legislation question its effectiveness and enforceability, given the inherently decentralized and borderless nature of crypto. They argue that the global internet infrastructure and the technical capabilities of digital currencies to facilitate direct peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries could significantly hinder the EU&#8217;s regulatory efforts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Virtual Assets can technically be transferred directly from one person to another without using intermediaries, which makes them impossible to regulate,&#8221; Dr. Breyer highlights, challenging the practicality of the EU&#8217;s approach.</p>
<p>Moreover, the criticism extends to the potential overreach of the EU in attempting to regulate a global phenomenon through regional legislation. The inherent flexibility and global reach of cryptocurrencies suggest that users may find ways to circumvent these regulations, raising questions about the ultimate effectiveness of the EU&#8217;s measures.</p>
<p>At press time, Bitcoin traded at $65,957.</p>

<title>Bitcoin ETF Alert: Analyst Issues Major Warning – Brace For Impact</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etf-alert-analyst-issues-major-warning/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etf-alert-analyst-issues-major-warning/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。比特币倡导者Samson Mow相信最新的资金流出将最终逆转，并敦促加密社区“做好相应计划”。尽管担心市场情绪可能导致比特币价格下跌，Mow强调了比特币的根本驱动因素，强调其终极稀缺性和无限需求。ETF的流出引起了加密社区的担忧，但Mow认为市场情绪并非首要关注，比特币的固有特性将会取胜。他还指出，ETF的流出最终将变成流入，需要做好相应计划。 Grayscale Bitcoin Trust（GBTC）的大规模提取也导致了ETF的流出，并且SEC对以太坊的态度也引起了关注。 <div>
<p>Samson Mow, a well-known Bitcoin advocate, has expressed his belief that the latest outflows will eventually reverse, cautioning the crypto community to &#8220;plan accordingly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Responding to concerns raised about potential decreases in Bitcoin&#8217;s price due to negative market sentiment, Mow emphasized the fundamental drivers of the leading cryptocurrency, highlighting its ultimate scarcity and unlimited demand.</p>

<h2><strong>Bitcoin Will Prevail, Mow Says</strong></h2>
<p>He dismissed market sentiment as a significant concern, suggesting that Bitcoin&#8217;s intrinsic qualities will prevail.</p>
<p>Amid these developments, spot-based Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have experienced significant outflows, sparking concerns within the cryptocurrency community.</p>
<p>Over the course of just three days this week, spot ETFs witnessed staggering outflows amounting to over $700 million. BlackRock&#8217;s IBIT, the largest Bitcoin ETF, has also experienced a notable decline in daily inflows.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">All <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">#Bitcoin</a> ETF outflows will eventually become inflows. Plan accordingly.</p>
<p>— Samson Mow (@Excellion) <a href="https://twitter.com/Excellion/status/1770680394825814330?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">March 21, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Once the leader in the market, it has seen its daily inflow plummet to $49 million, marking the lowest amount recorded in the past weeks. This decline in inflows adds to the growing concerns surrounding the state of Bitcoin ETFs.</p>
<p>A key factor driving investors to exit Grayscale is the company&#8217;s higher fees when compared to its competitors in the ETF market. Lower fees offered by other providers have enticed investors away from Grayscale, leading to the substantial outflows witnessed recently.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/BSeQ7VAL/" width="2475" /></p>

<p>Experts attribute these outflows largely to a massive withdrawal of BTC from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which has been plagued by consistent outflows ever since the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) allowed the conversion of GBTC into a spot ETF.</p>
<h2><strong>Factors Contributing To The Outflows</strong></h2>
<p>Moreover, the SEC&#8217;s approval of the launch of 10 spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 11 further contributed to the outflows. In addition to his comments on ETFs, Mow also shared his views on the potential approval of ETFs based on the Ethereum spot trading price.</p>
<p>He believes that Ethereum (ETH) should be classified as a security and expects the SEC to eventually deem it as such. He criticizes the SEC&#8217;s approval of ETH futures ETFs, considering it a significant mistake.</p>

<p>Mow&#8217;s warning regarding the potential reversal of outflows adds an element of uncertainty to the situation. As the cryptocurrency community grapples with these developments, industry experts will closely monitor the market to assess if Mow&#8217;s prediction of a reversal comes to fruition or if further challenges lie ahead.</p>
<p>While the future of Bitcoin ETFs remains uncertain, the resilience of the cryptocurrency market has been tested time and again. Investors and enthusiasts will closely keep an eye on the developments in the coming days, hoping for stability and renewed confidence in the digital asset space.</p>

<title>Ripple CEO Predicts Setback For US SEC In Ethereum Case, Similar To XRP</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-ceo-predicts-sec-setback-in-ethereum-case/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-ceo-predicts-sec-setback-in-ethereum-case/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章介绍了美国SEC与加密货币领域的法律斗争，Ripple CEO对于SEC与以太坊的法律纠纷表达了乐观的看法，预测SEC最终将败诉。文中还提及了SEC与CFTC之间的竞争，以及Ripple在与SEC的诉讼中取得的部分胜利。最终，文章指出，Ripple与SEC的长期法律纠纷即将迎来高潮，预计将于4月23日举行大审判。 <div>
<p>The legal battle between the United States <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/why-now-reasons-ethereum-probe-by-sec/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ethereum (ETH)</a> has transformed into an intriguing case within the entire cryptocurrency landscape, with several experts predicting possible outcomes regarding the dispute.</p>
<h2>Ripple CEO Warns US SEC&#8217;s Inevitable Defeat Against Ethereum</h2>
<p>As the battle wages on, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Ripple Labs Brad Garlinghouse, has <a href="https://x.com/bgarlinghouse/status/1770958740646502889?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">revealed</a> his optimistic insights on the case, while sharing a daring prediction in favor of the Ethereum ecosystem. His positive insights came in light of reports that the SEC is attempting to classify Ethereum &#8220;as a security&#8221; through its legal dispute with the digital asset.</p>

<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-ceo-success-for-xrp/">Brad Garlinghouse</a> has predicted that the US regulatory watchdog is most likely to &#8220;lose its war against Ethereum&#8221; &#8211; the second largest cryptocurrency asset. According to Garlinghouse, the Commission&#8217;s several &#8220;attempts to include the cryptocurrency industry in legal battles have resulted in severe court losses&#8221; over time.</p>
<p>As a result, the agency is now &#8220;lagging behind its foreign counterparts&#8221; and &#8220;competing with other regulators&#8221; such as the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).</p>
<p>The Ripple CEO then posed a question, &#8220;When would the SEC realize that it would not be able to continue fighting to categorize Ethereum as a security, as it did with XRP?&#8221;</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-coinbase-futures-listing/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Coinbase</a> submitted self-certifications with the CFTC on March 7, which could pave the way for Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Litecoin (LTC) futures Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), if the CTFC has no complaints against it.</p>
<p>Consequently, the SEC&#8217;s prospects of overturning the &#8220;Programmatic Sales of XRP&#8221; ruling might be impacted by the categorization of these aforementioned tokens as commodities by the CFTC. This could be one of the reasons why the SEC could be fighting the CFTC.</p>
<h2>Ripple&#8217;s Partial Victories Against The SEC</h2>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-brazilian-real-stablecoin-xrp-ledger/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ripple</a> first secured a partial win in its lawsuit with the agency when Judge Analisa Torres declared in July last year that programmatic sales of XRP do not meet the requirements of the third prong of the Howey Test. Also, three months later, the SEC&#8217;s request for an interlocutory appeal against the programmatic sales order was denied by the US Judge.</p>

<p>Due to the order, the SEC will be unable to file an appeal until the conclusion of the ongoing <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-vs-sec-crucial-dates-2024/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">SEC v. Ripple lawsuit</a>. It is believed that the resolution of this dispute may have a profound impact on the US regulatory landscape and the cryptocurrency landscape as a whole.</p>
<p>The long-running legal dispute between Ripple and the US SEC began in 2020 when the Commission accused Ripple of selling XRP to US investors as an unregistered security. However, the lengthy battle is slowly approaching its climax as the grand trial is scheduled to take place by April 23.</p>

<title>Crypto In The Spotlight: Estonia Greenlights Regulation Bill</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-on-stage-estonia-okays-regulation-bill/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-on-stage-estonia-okays-regulation-bill/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。爱沙尼亚政府通过新法案，加强了加密货币服务提供商的监管，并将其纳入金融监管机构（FSA）的监管范围。这标志着爱沙尼亚对金融不端行为的强硬立场，并将爱沙尼亚的加密货币规定与欧盟框架保持一致。新法案旨在在鼓励创新的同时确保市场安全，为合法企业提供了前进的道路，并为筹集资金的公司减少了证券招股义务。爱沙尼亚借此机会成为欧盟内信誉良好的加密货币服务提供商的枢纽。 <div>
<p>Estonia, a nation long known for its embrace of digital innovation, is revamping its cryptocurrency regulations to create a more robust and transparent market. The Estonian government recently approved a bill that will significantly<a href="https://news.err.ee/1609289883/estonia-introduces-legislation-to-regulate-cryptocurrency-providers" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> increase oversight of cryptocurrency</a> service providers, bringing them under the stricter purview of the Financial Supervision Authority (FSA).</p>
<p>This shift marks a significant change from the previous system, where the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) primarily focused on Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance. The FSA, on the other hand, will implement a comprehensive regulatory framework, including stricter licensing requirements and the power to impose hefty fines of up to €5 million for AML violations. This move signals Estonia&#8217;s strong stance against financial malpractices within the sector.</p>

<h2><strong>Aligning With Europe: A Unified Approach</strong></h2>
<p>The new bill is not just about tightening internal controls; it also seeks to harmonize Estonian regulations with the European Union&#8217;s<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/what-is-market-in-crypto-assets-6751039#:~:text=The%20Markets%20in%20Crypto%2DAssets%20regulation%20is%20a%20European%20Union,providing%20crypto%20products%20and%20services." rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA)</a> framework. This alignment signifies Estonia&#8217;s commitment to creating a consistent approach to crypto regulation across EU member states. With MiCA set to take effect in early 2025, Estonia is taking a proactive step to ensure a smooth transition for both businesses and regulators.</p>
<h2><strong>Balancing Innovation With Security</strong></h2>
<p>Estonia has a well-deserved reputation for being crypto-friendly. In 2017, it established itself as a haven for digital currency companies by simplifying registration procedures and fostering a welcoming legal environment. However, the 2020 revocation of numerous licenses due to non-compliance highlighted the need for stricter oversight. The current bill represents a measured approach, aiming to strike a balance between encouraging innovation and safeguarding the market.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/vPxBzqLU/" width="2475" /></p>

<strong>A Safe Harbor For Crypto Businesses</strong>
<p>The Estonian government seems to be sending a clear message: innovation is welcome, but responsible conduct is paramount. The new regulations, while stricter, offer a path forward for legitimate businesses. Existing crypto firms with FIU licenses will be granted a grace period until the end of 2025 to obtain FSA licenses, providing them with ample time to adapt to the new requirements.</p>
<p>Additionally, the bill introduces a relaxed securities prospectus obligation for companies seeking to raise capital. This move aims to make it easier and more cost-effective for businesses to secure funding, potentially benefiting not just the crypto sector but also fostering the growth of the Estonian capital market as a whole.</p>

<strong>Estonia&#8217;s Potential As A Crypto Leader</strong>
<p>By strengthening its regulatory framework and aligning with EU-wide standards, Estonia is positioning itself as a leader in the European crypto landscape. This measured approach, combining innovation with robust oversight, could attract businesses seeking a secure and transparent environment to operate in. With its established digital infrastructure and a government committed to responsible regulation, Estonia has the potential to become a hub for reputable crypto service providers within the European Union.</p>

<title>Why Now? Crypto Lawyer Uncovers Reasons For Ethereum Probe By SEC</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/why-now-reasons-ethereum-probe-by-sec/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/why-now-reasons-ethereum-probe-by-sec/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。Scott Johnsson提供了关于SEC对以太坊和以太坊基金会展开调查动机的深入分析。他探讨了SEC重新评估以太坊非证券地位的动机，特别是在考虑到市场对当前分类的依赖性的情况下。文章还讨论了SEC在审批ETF时可能遇到的挑战，以及与保持一致性相关的问题。最后，文章提到了民主党参议员对暂停批准更多现货加密货币ETF的呼吁。 <div>
<p>Scott Johnsson, a finance lawyer and general partner at Van Buren Capital, provided a nuanced <a href="https://twitter.com/SGJohnsson/status/1770920022463942972" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">analysis</a> of the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s (SEC) motivations for launching an investigation into Ethereum and the Ethereum Foundation. His insights, shared via X on March 22, offer a deep dive into the potential motivations for the agency to<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-in-the-hot-seat-sec-security-label-looms/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> probe the Swiss based Ethereum Foundatio</a>n.</p>
<p>Johnsson began by highlighting the profound market reliance on Ethereum&#8217;s classification as a non-security, a stance historically acknowledged by the SEC and other regulatory bodies. He stressed the importance of this classification for the functioning of various market mechanisms, stating:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Paul [Grewal, Coinbase CLO] gives a good overview on the SEC’s historical acknowledgements re: ETH non-security status. This is the current landscape that the market has relied on &#8211; including the CFTC, CME, ETFs, exchanges, and investors. Reliance interests are incredibly high.</strong></p></blockquote>
<h2>Is Thwarting The Spot Ethereum ETFs The Main Goal?</h2>
<p>A key aspect of Johnsson&#8217;s analysis revolves around the SEC&#8217;s potential motives for reconsidering Ethereum&#8217;s status at this particular juncture. He suggests that the regulatory body is navigating a complex landscape, balancing the need to enforce securities laws with the market&#8217;s reliance on existing classifications.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beyond simple anti-crypto animus, it’s worth thinking about why the SEC is choosing this moment to potentially reassess ETH’s status as non-security and what may be specifically motivating them. Motive meets opportunity,&#8221; Johnsson elaborates.</p>
<p>He further speculates on the SEC&#8217;s strategy regarding ETH spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and its broader implications: &#8220;My view, and there are other reasonable takes, is that the SEC needs a non-correlation objection to deny ETH spot ETFs this year and has a desire to avoid undermining the args in the CB/Binance actions – together representing the two biggest crypto issues the agency is managing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Johnsson points out the inherent challenges in the SEC&#8217;s path, particularly maintaining a consistent approach to crypto regulation so as not to prejudice its own arguments in the<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/paradigm-industry-titans-rallying-behind-coinbase/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> cases against Coinbase</a> <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-us-faces-sec-probe-over-asset-handling/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">and Binance</a>. He notes, &#8220;And if the SEC learned anything from BTC ETFs, it’s to be very careful in the reasoning provided in denials and specifically that it form a coherent whole across similar orders. Grayscale won because the SEC made logical errors when approving futures and denying spot across time.&#8221;</p>

<p>The finance lawyer also delves into the technicalities of correlation analysis, a pivotal factor in the SEC&#8217;s decision-making process for ETF approvals. He explains, &#8220;Using the methodology I believe the SEC will rely, CME futures:spot correlation is INCREASING and the most recent periods are mostly within an acceptable range (i.e., aligning with BTC approval levels). At least based on internally run calcs.&#8221; Therefore, the SEC cannot reject a spot ETF on this basis.</p>
<p>Johnsson underscores the SEC&#8217;s delicate balancing act, which cannot question its previous decisions, but at the same time has to deny spot ETH ETF to satisfy its backers. He articulates, &#8220;This kills a few birds: 1) bolsters credibility for CB/Binance args, 2) denies spot ETH ETF with 2025 optionality and 3) satisfies Gary’s backers. All while avoiding (for now) blowing up CME futures, an interagency fight and invalidating futures ETFs (miring SEC in litigation).&#8221;</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Democratic Senators Jack Reed and Laphonza Butler <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/us-senators-urge-sec-no-more-crypto-etfs/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">called on SEC Chairman Gary Gensler</a> to halt the approval of additional spot crypto ETFs. Senator Elizabeth Warren has also expressed strong criticism of these financial products. Last year, Butler endorsed Senator Elizabeth Warren’s contentious <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/us-senators-efforts-to-kill-crypto-move-forward/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act</a> by co-sponsoring the bill.</p>
<p>At press time, ETH traded at $3,526.</p>

<title>Former FTX Executive’s Platform Secures $60 Million In Claims, Here Are The Details</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/former-ftx-executives-platform-secures-60-million/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/former-ftx-executives-platform-secures-60-million/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。前FTX客户将灾难转化为可能有利可图的投资，购买FTX破产索赔并建立投资基金。他们帮助其他受害者购买索赔，并处理赔款，许多人准备重新投资加密货币市场。尽管存在复杂性和挑战，但FTX Creditor的努力带来了一定程度的满足和希望。FTT代币目前价格上涨，但在较长时间范围内有所下降。 <div>
<p>Former FTX customers, left uncertain of the fate of their funds after the collapse of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-50-years/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">now-bankrupt crypto exchange</a>, have turned their misfortune into a potentially profitable venture. </p>
<p>Led by individuals such as Louis d&#8217;Origny and Ramnik Arora, FTX&#8217;s former head of product, this group has seized the opportunity to invest in FTX <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/blockfi-resolves-dispute-with-ftx-alameda-research/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">bankruptcy claims</a>. Their FTX Creditor platform facilitates the acquisition of millions of dollars worth of claims.</p>
<h2>FTX Collapse Spurs Lucrative Investment</h2>
<p>According to a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-21/platform-built-by-former-ftx-exec-snaps-up-60-million-in-claims" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, following FTX&#8217;s implosion, d’Origny recognized the potential investment opportunity and became one of the first to purchase FTX bankruptcy claims from fellow customers facing a similar predicament. </p>
<p>Capitalizing on this early move, d’Origny established four investment funds and acquired approximately $31 million claims. Additionally, through the FTX Creditor platform, d’Origny and his partner Arora facilitated the purchase of an additional $60 million in claims.</p>

<p>FTX Creditor primarily targets <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/former-ftx-alameda-executives-crypto-exchange-us/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">bankruptcy claimants</a> who held less than $100,000 on the exchange. d’Origny expressed his intention to create a “transparent and efficient” process for these creditors to alleviate the risks and alleged lack of transparency that “plagued” the market. </p>
<p>According to the report, when d&#8217;Origny and his team first began buying claims, they estimated that creditors would recover about 25 to 30 cents on the dollar. The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/incarcerated-sam-bankman-fried-promote-solana/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">average cost of claims</a> purchased through their third fund was 15 cents on the dollar owed. </p>
<p>Their strategy was based on the assumption that significant clawbacks would occur, resulting in significant recoveries. However, uncertainties surrounding claim pricing and new bankruptcy developments have added complexity to the process.</p>
<h2>Cryptocurrency Prices Surge Creates New Dynamics</h2>
<p>Throughout the purchasing process, d’Origny and his team encountered various challenges. In one instance, while negotiating the purchase of a $4 million claim with a customer, they learned that the US Internal Revenue Service had <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-creditors-1-billion-crypto/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">filed bankruptcy </a>claims worth billions of dollars against FTX. Despite the uncertainty, they proceeded with the purchase, albeit at a discount of 25 cents on the dollar.</p>
<p>As cryptocurrency prices experienced a significant surge, some FTX customers <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-faces-lawsuit-from-creditors-challenging/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">expressed concerns</a> about the current plan to peg the value of their holdings to digital asset prices from November 2022. </p>
<p>However, d’Origny highlighted the satisfaction of the claimants he works with, as his platform processes purchases, often within 30 minutes. According to the report, many claimants are even eager to reinvest the funds they receive back into the cryptocurrency market.</p>

<p>While the exchange has assured a bankruptcy judge that creditors who can prove their losses will likely recover their entire <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-repayment-plan-bitcoin-valued-at-16000/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">investments</a>, the rise in cryptocurrency prices presents a new dimension. </p>
<p>As challenges persist, the relief experienced by claimants and their readiness to reinvest in the cryptocurrency market demonstrates the impact of FTX Creditor&#8217;s efforts.</p>
<img alt="FTX" class="size-large" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/cAmgv1A5/" width="1815" />
<p>As of this writing, FTT is trading at $1.989, reflecting a significant surge of 10% within the past 24 hours. However, when considering longer time frames, such as the previous two weeks, the token continues to exhibit losses exceeding 20%.</p>

<title>Rumors Swirl As North Korea’s ETH Transfer To BlackRock Via Tornado Cash Sparks Speculation</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/north-koreas-eth-transfer-to-blackrock-via-tornado/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/north-koreas-eth-transfer-to-blackrock-via-tornado/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是负面的。文章指出与加密货币相关的非法活动引发了人们日益关注，报道称北朝鲜黑客与臭名昭著的拉萨路斯集团联系到以太坊（ETH）的漏洞，通过虚拟货币混合器的操作。一名社交媒体用户将北朝鲜黑客传送1 ETH（价值3270美元）给全球最大的资产管理公司黑石集团，但其动机尚不明确。此外，文章还提到Tornado Cash因涉嫌协助非法活动而受到美国制裁，并介绍了北朝鲜黑客近期利用Tornado Cash洗钱数百万美元的情况。黑石集团尚未对此做出回应。以太坊价格在过去24小时有所反弹，但仍比过去一周下跌6%。 <div>
<p>Amidst growing concerns of illicit activities involving cryptocurrencies, reports have emerged linking North Korean hackers associated with the notorious Lazarus Group to an exploit of Ethereum (ETH) through the virtual currency mixer <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/tornado-cash-founder-charged-for-allegedly-aiding-1-2-billion-in-laundered-funds/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Tornado Cash</a>. </p>
<p>It is alleged that the hackers are now involved in a transfer to BlackRock, the largest asset management firm, as claimed by a user of social media platform X (formerly Twitter).</p>
<h2>Alleged Transaction Links North Korean Hackers To BlackRock</h2>
<p>The user, operating under the pseudonym &#8220;Icebergy,&#8221; <a href="https://x.com/icebergy_/status/1770477188527071348?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">shared </a>an image suggesting a transaction tied to North Korean hackers transferring 1 ETH, valued at $3,270, to BlackRock for undisclosed reasons. </p>
<p>If true, this development may pose challenges for the asset manager. Tornado Cash and the Lazarus Group have faced increased scrutiny from US regulators due to potential illicit activities facilitated by the mixer and alleged violations of anti-money laundering (AML) <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/hackers-exploit-sanctioned-mixer-tornado-cash/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">regulations </a>within the US jurisdiction.</p>

<img alt="Blackrock " class="size-large wp-image-288744" height="157" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GJH_nszXsAEVTTj.jpeg?w=980&#038;resize=980%2C157" width="980" />
<p>As <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/tornado-cash-legal-war-against-us-sanctions-ends/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">reported </a>by Bitcoinist, in 2022, Tornado Cash faced legal action from the US Treasury Department&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). The agency targeted the software due to its alleged role in allowing cybercriminal activity. </p>
<p>The US agency claims that bad actors used Tornado Cash to launder over $7 billion worth of crypto assets since its launch in 2019. </p>
<p>Consequently, OFAC sanctioned the mixer&#8217;s wallets and other smart contracts associated with its operations. The sanctions also contain allegations of &#8220;facilitating&#8221; <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/tornado-cash-co-founde-to-us-sanctions-list/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">money laundering</a> for hackers supporting foreign terrorists, as a significant number of hacking incidents involving crypto asset theft have been linked to terrorist groups. </p>
<p>Notably, in February 2023, Chainalysis reported that North Korean hacking groups had stolen up to $2 billion in crypto assets in 2022, frequently utilizing Tornado Cash to obfuscate their <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/tornado-cash-case-could-mean-for-code-publishing/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">transactions</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, it has been revealed that North Korean hackers, believed to be part of the Lazarus Group, exploited the coin-mixing service Tornado Cash to launder approximately $12 million worth of stolen Ethereum on March 14.</p>
<h2>Tornado Cash Returns To Focus</h2>
<p>As blockchain analytics firm Elliptic <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-laundering-north-korean-tornado-cash/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">reported</a>, in response to the sanctions imposed on Tornado Cash, the Lazarus Group briefly shifted its focus to using cross-chain bridges and the Bitcoin-based mixer Sinbad.io as an alternative. </p>
<p>However, US authorities seized Sinbad.io in November 2023, eliminating another option for commingling funds. Consequently, the group appears to have returned to utilizing Tornado Cash.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the motive behind the alleged transfer of ETH tied to North Korean hackers remains undisclosed, and the relatively small amount involved raises questions about its specific objective. </p>

<p>At the time of writing, BlackRock has not responded to the matter, and no further information has been released. It is important to note that BlackRock has consistently operated within the US regulatory frameworks and complied with federal laws, which led the asset manager to receive approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for its newly approved Spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) under the ticker IBIT. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the presence of BlackRock&#8217;s on-chain addresses in the public blockchain does not necessarily indicate a collaborative effort but rather a unilateral move by the alleged North Korean side, perhaps to generate controversy surrounding the asset manager&#8217;s reputation.</p>
<img alt="Blackrock " class="size-large" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/xr7mKAUj/" width="1815" />
<p>Ethereum (ETH) has successfully rebounded to reach the $3,511 mark following a significant decline to the $3,069 level. In the past 24 hours, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has experienced a notable surge of 10%. However, the token still retains losses exceeding 6% over the past week.</p>

<title>UN Reveals: 50% Of North Korea’s Foreign Earnings From Crypto Attacks And Cyber Heists</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/un-north-koreas-foreign-earnings-crypto-attack/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/un-north-koreas-foreign-earnings-crypto-attack/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。最近联合国的调查显示，朝鲜利用加密黑客等网络活动来“支持”其经济并推进武器发展计划的程度。报告显示，朝鲜通过被认为是“恶意”的加密相关公司攻击来获取大约一半的外汇收入，支持其武器发展项目。尽管朝鲜黑客组织对安全措施的适应性有所减少，但它们仍在采用越来越“复杂”的策略继续进行网络活动。拉萨鲁斯小组的增加对Tornado Cash的依赖表明他们正通过该平台进行洗钱活动。 <div>
<p>In recent findings, an investigation by the United Nations has <a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20240321001100315#:~:text=%22The%20malicious%20cyberactivities%20of%20the,from%20%22one%20member%20state.%22" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">illuminated</a> the extent to which North Korea has leveraged cyber activities such as crypto hacks to &#8220;bolster&#8221; its economy and further its weapons development programs.</p>
<p>The report spans from 2017 to 2023 and details a series of cyberattacks targeting crypto-related firms. It highlights the approach of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea (DPRK) as it targets the nascent industry.</p>

<h2>Crypto Loot Fuels Foreign Earnings</h2>
<p>The UN revealed that North Korea has participated in <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-north-korea-linked-lazarus-group-2023-losses/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">cyber operations</a> deemed &#8220;malicious&#8221; to secure roughly half of its foreign currency earnings, which support its weapons development initiatives.</p>
<p>The panel noted, citing information from &#8220;one member state&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>The malicious cyberactivities of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea (DPRK) generate approximately 50 percent of its foreign currency income and are used to fund its weapons programs.</p></blockquote>
<p>Particularly, with an estimated loss of $3 billion attributed to these cyber incursions, the UN&#8217;s assessment sheds light on the web of state-sponsored <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/spain-detains-fugitive-in-crypto-scheme-north-korea/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">hacking operations</a>, underscoring their significance in funding approximately 40% of the DPRK&#8217;s program to build weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<img alt="The global crypto market cap value on TradingView" class="size-medium" height="1496" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/t4paDGSz/" width="2770" />
<p>It is worth noting that the UN revelation aligns with previous estimates from the United States, further corroborated by recent analytics from blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis. The firm&#8217;s 2023 <a href="https://go.chainalysis.com/2023-crypto-crime-report.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">report</a> marks a notable year for crypto platform vulnerabilities, with North Korea linked to a record number of hacks.</p>
<h2>Adapting To Shifting Cyber Landscape</h2>
<p>However, there was a<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/surge-in-north-korean-crypto-attacks-hacks-2023/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> significant decline in the total value of stolen assets</a> compared to previous years. Despite this, the DPRK operatives persist while adapting to security measures with increasingly &#8220;sophisticated&#8221; tactics, according to Joe Dobson, principal analyst at cybersecurity firm Mandiant.</p>
<p>Dobson noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>They look at what’s changing, what’s evolving, and how they can use that malicious intent. Whatever the advancement is, they’re going to find a way to take advantage of it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Tools such as Tornado Cash for laundering stolen Ethereum further exemplify this. According to a recent report, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-heist-north-korean-hackers-swipe-600-million/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">North Korean hackers</a> associated with the notorious Lazarus Group have utilized Tornado Cash to<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-laundering-north-korean-tornado-cash/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> launder around $12 million in stolen Ethereum (ETH)</a>.</p>
<p>Elliptic reports that the Lazarus Group&#8217;s increased dependence on Tornado Cash resulted from reduced large-scale mixing services available following law enforcement&#8217;s crackdown on platforms such as Sinbad.io and Blender.io.</p>

<p>Facing limited options, the group has turned to leveraging Tornado Cash, which remains operational despite being under US sanctions.</p>

<title>OKX To Cease Operations In This Asian Country, Urging Users To Liquidate Holdings By April 30</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/okx-to-cease-operations-in-this-asian-country/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/okx-to-cease-operations-in-this-asian-country/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。OKX宣布退出印度加密货币市场，由于当地监管障碍。用户被告知关闭所有持仓，并从帐户中提取所有资金。印度金融情报单位对9家外国加密货币交易所发布了合规通知，其中包括OKX。尽管加密货币市场总估值为2.44万亿美元，但比特币的价格波动较大，正在努力保持在66700美元以上的水平。 <div>
<p>In a recent development, Seychelles-based firm OKX, one of the largest <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-crypto-dominance-declines/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">cryptocurrency exchanges</a> in the world, has announced the shutdown of its services in India. </p>
<p>According to recent <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/okx-shuts-services-in-india-cites-local-regulations/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reports</a>, the decision comes in response to regulatory hurdles faced by the exchange in the country. Users were notified of the closure through a notice sent on Thursday, stating that OKX &#8220;is no longer providing services to the users in India&#8221; due to local regulations.</p>
<h2>OKX Announces Exit From Indian Crypto Market</h2>
<p>The notice from OKX urged users to take specific actions before the deadline. Users were instructed to close all margin positions, including perpetual, futures, and options contracts, and<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/okx-support-bitcoin-ordinals-lists-major-brc-20/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> redeem funds</a> from staking products. </p>
<p>Additionally, users were advised to withdraw all funds from their accounts. After April 30, 2024, at 2 AM UTC, account functionalities would be restricted, although fund withdrawals would still be permitted.</p>

<p>OKX&#8217;s decision to exit the Indian market follows the issuance of a compliance notice by the Indian Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) against nine foreign cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance, KuCoin, Huobi, Kraken, Gate.io, Bittrex, Bitstamp, MEXC Global, and Bitfinex. </p>
<p>The FIU alleged <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/okx-delists-usdt-trading-in-europe-heres-why/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">illegal operations</a> and violations of local anti-money laundering (AML) regulations by the exchanges above. While the FIU blocked access to these exchanges&#8217; websites with a two-week notice, some continued providing services to existing customers through apps.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that OKX was not among the exchanges named by the FIU in its compliance notice. However, the exchange had previously strengthened its know-your-customer (KYC) processes in India. Despite these efforts, OKX has now decided to withdraw its services completely from the country.</p>
<h2>Navigating Regulatory Landscapes</h2>
<p>Despite shutting down its operations in India, OKX is focusing on strengthening its operations in other regions. As previously <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/okx-approved-a-win-for-singapores-crypto-ambitions/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">reported </a>by Bitcoinist, the exchange has obtained licenses in Singapore and Dubai, demonstrating its interest in expanding its services globally. In addition, OKX has launched trading in Turkey&#8217;s local currency.</p>
<p>The closure of OKX&#8217;s services in India highlights the challenges cryptocurrency exchanges face due to evolving<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/okx-probe-south-korea-alleged-crypto-violations/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> regulatory landscapes</a>. As governments worldwide continue to formulate their policies regarding cryptocurrencies, exchanges have to navigate a complex regulatory environment to ensure compliance and provide services to their users.</p>

<p>While OKX emphasizes the safety of user funds and assures that withdrawals will remain accessible, Indian users are encouraged to follow the exchange&#8217;s guidelines to secure their assets. </p>
<img alt="OKX" class="size-large" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/69IvXEyn/" width="1815" />
<p>As of the current time, the total valuation of the crypto market cap is $2.44 trillion. This comes after a significant decline to $2.2 trillion on Wednesday, following a peak of $2.7 trillion, which hadn&#8217;t been reached since November 2021.</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC), on the other hand, has made progress in minimizing its losses. After experiencing a steep drop to $60,900, it is now attempting to regain stability above the $66,700 level.</p>

<title>Here’s How This Crypto Investor Made $23.5 Million With Shiba Inu In Two Months</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-23-5-million-shiba-inu/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-23-5-million-shiba-inu/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />一位加密货币投资者在过去两个月里通过投资Shiba Inu赚取了2350万美元。他在1月份开始购买大量SHIB代币，价格低于0.00001美元，并在两个月内将其收益增长到3200万美元。此外，还有一位神秘的交易者通过在2020年8月以8000美元投资Shiba Inu成为亿万富翁，其投资回报超过50亿美元。Shiba Inu自推出以来一直在为投资者创造财富。<br /> <div>
<p class="p2">Shiba Inu has been making millionaires since its inception in 2020 and this has not changed even as it has become a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-shiba-inu-updates/">billion-dollar meme coin</a>. A crypto investor recently made a $23.5 million from investing the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-bone-new-target/">SHIB</a> token over the last two months. Here’s how they did it.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Shiba Inu Investor Makes Bank</h2>
<p class="p2">On-chain analytics platform Spot On Chain <a href="https://x.com/spotonchain/status/1766315511783006226?s=20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">revealed</a> that a particular trader had been making massive moves in the market over the last few months. The trader had begun buying large chunks of SHIB tokens back in January when the price was still trending below $0.00001. In total, the whale trader was able to accumulate around 1.24 trillion SHIB for $11.66 million at the time.</p>

<p class="p2">Then, over the next two months, the Shiba Inu price would go on an incredible rally that saw its price more than 4x. At its local peak, the SHIB price climbed as high as $0.00004 before retracing. This surge in price booked massive profits for the trader, and by mid-March, the whale investors saw their Shiba Inu holdings grow over $32 million.</p>
<p class="p2">On March 16, the trader finally took the plunge and deposited the entirety of their <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-bone-new-target/">SHIB</a> holdings to the Binance and Gate crypto exchanges. Now, when investors deposit coins to centralized exchanges, it is usually to sell. If this is the true intention of the whale investor and they were looking to sell, they would’ve made a total profit of $23.5 million after sending 1.24 trillion <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-shiba-inu-updates/">SHIB</a> to exchanges.</p>
<p class="p2">This is not the only massive trade the whale trader has made in the last few months. Spot On Chain also revealed that this particular trader also made a profit of $44.3 million on their FLOKI holdings and $5.82 million from their BIGTIME holdings.</p>
<h2 class="p2">The Legendary SHIB Investor</h2>
<p class="p2">While the whale investor above has made significant profits from investing in Shiba Inu, one trader still holds the record for a single legendary <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-price-down-today/">SHIB trade</a>. An anonymous trader who identifies as “Shibtoshi” became a billionaire by investing $8,000 in the meme coin.</p>

<p class="p2">In 2023, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/billionaire-with-shiba-inu/">Shibtoshi sat down for an interview with YouTuber Bad Anthony</a> where he revealed that he had invested $8,000 in <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-surge-in-interest/">SHIB</a> in August 2020. However, the token would not immediately perform well as Shibtoshi revealed it had dipped significantly after his purchase.</p>
<p class="p2">Eventually, the Shiba Inu market cap would rise as high as $30 billion and at the top, Shibtoshi’s <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-surge-in-interest/">SHIB</a> stash was worth over $5 billion. This single trade remains legendary in crypto as Shibtoshi became the first person to become a billionaire from trading meme coins.</p>

<title>A16z Crypto Lawyer Unleashes Scathing Attack On US SEC, Spot Ethereum ETF In Danger?</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/a16z-crypto-lawyer-us-sec-spot-ethereum-etfs/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/a16z-crypto-lawyer-us-sec-spot-ethereum-etfs/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。<br />马尔斯·詹宁斯，a16z Crypto的总法律顾问，抨击了美国证券交易委员会（SEC）及其对加密货币监管的处理。他指责SEC的加密货币执法部门存在“无能”的律师，对于DebtBox一案的处理中存在滥用权力。文章还提到了对SEC在加密ETF审批上的压力，并讨论了对雇佣前SEC加密货币执法律师的律所进行制裁的措施。舆论对此有不同看法，有些人支持詹宁斯的立场，有些人认为这种制裁措施是“惩罚性的”。 <div>
<p>Miles Jennings, the General Counsel at a16z Crypto, one of the world&#8217;s largest venture capital firms, has launched a blistering attack on the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and its handling of crypto regulation.</p>
<h2>Are The United States SEC Lawyers At The Enforcement Division Abusing Power?</h2>
<p>The lawyer specifically targeted the agency&#8217;s crypto enforcement division in a <a href="https://twitter.com/milesjennings/status/1770473643237376383" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X. Not only does the General Counsel think the division has &#8220;incompetent&#8221; lawyers, but they are &#8220;complicit in the ongoing abuses of power,&#8221; especially in light of the Debt Box case.</p>

<p>Last year, the United States SEC sued Debt Box, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/debt-box-judge-penalizes-sec-for-abuse-of-power/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">accusing</a> them of fraud, leading to the loss of over $49 million for investors. At the center of the contentious case, the regulator claimed that though DebtBox claimed they were selling node licenses to prospective investors for mining cryptocurrencies, none of these coins ended up being mined. </p>
<p>Debt Box countered these charges and won. The judge sided with the blockchain firm, accusing the United States SEC of presenting &#8220;misleading statements and abusing power.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pressure has been mounting on the agency because of the outcome of the DebtBox ruling. Most critics, especially in the crypto and blockchain sector, endorse the court&#8217;s verdict that the SEC abuses power.</p>
<p>In the post on X, Jennings said the United States SEC&#8217;s pursuit of DebtBox was a &#8220;symptom of hyper politicization&#8221; that has shaken their trust in the enforcement division. </p>
<h2>Spot Ethereum ETF Next, Same Outcome As DebtBox?</h2>
<p>For this reason, the lawyer said a16z Crypto will no longer work with law firms that hire former SEC crypto enforcement lawyers. Jennings argues that this move is necessary to combat the alleged issues within the SEC. </p>
<p>Even so, no official statement from the venture capital firm supports this statement.</p>

<p>The post remains controversial, drawing varied comments. While some commentators supported the lawyer&#8217;s stance, others argued that blacklisting law firms hiring from the enforcement division will be &#8220;punitive.&#8221; </p>
<p>Amid the storm, some are defending the professionalism and ethics of <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/JasonBerkun/status/1770620239161553051" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">some</a> of the agency&#8217;s lawyers, acknowledging there could be &#8220;bad faith&#8221; actors in any organization.</p>
<p>How the agency will respond to criticism remains to be seen, especially from the crypto community. The commission will likely be under fire as laws are drafted and policy evolves. </p>

<p>Presently, eyes are also on the United States SEC and how they will rule on the multiple spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). In a recent post on X, Paul Grewal, the General Counsel for Coinbase, <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1770594634785542476" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">said</a> the agency has &#8220;no reason to decline applications made for the product.&#8221;</p>

<title>Did This Bitcoin On-Chain Metric Predict Recovery In Advance?</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-on-chain-metric-predict-recovery-in-advance/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />比特币的调整SOPR在最新的复苏之前重新测试了一个历史相关线。分析显示，比特币价格下跌至60,600美元后反弹。aSOPR指标在价格下跌期间降至1.0水平，表明投资者正在以净利润出售比特币。在价格回调时，损失开始积累，aSOPR向1.0水平回落。1.0水平通常是比特币找到反弹的点。目前比特币价格约为67,000美元，过去一周上涨5%。 <div>
<p>On-chain data indicates that Bitcoin had retested a historically relevant line right before the latest recovery had come.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Adjusted SOPR Retested The 1.0 Level Prior To Recovery</h2>
<p>When Bitcoin was declining, the cryptocurrency had dropped to a low of $60,600, which appears to have been the bottom, at least so far, given that the coin has rebounded sharply since hitting the mark.</p>
<p>Around the time of BTC&#8217;s recent low prices, an analyst had pointed out in a CryptoQuant Quicktake <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/65fb1988a3be2268b3df088e-Understanding-ASOPR-and-Market-Behavior" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> that the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-sopr-nears-vital-retest-bulls-find-victory/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Adjusted Spent Output Profit Ratio (aSOPR)</a> had plunged to a value of 1 alongside the asset&#8217;s drop.</p>

<p>The aSOPR is an on-chain indicator that tells us whether Bitcoin investors realize a net profit or loss with their current selling.</p>
<p>This metric works by going through the blockchain history of each coin being transferred currently to check what price it was moved at before this. If the last price was greater than the current price, the coin&#8217;s sale would realize a loss; otherwise, it would count under profit-taking.</p>
<p>The aSOPR can only say this, of course, with the assumption that both of these transactions involved a change of hands for the coin in question (that is, selling/buying took place).</p>
<p>As for why the aSOPR has &#8220;Adjusted&#8221; in its name, this version of the SOPR metric has been adjusted to exclude coins that transferred within only an hour of their previous transaction.</p>
<p>Such transfers are usually essentially noise for the indicator as they don&#8217;t pose any greater consequence for the market, hence why they aren&#8217;t taken into account.</p>
<p>Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin aSOPR over the past few years:</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin aSOPR" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="806" src="https://i0.wp.com/img.cryptoquant.com/368746/quicktake/cNy0f_9973b23ddfd075adad5ca7f75afea53d770d1c1269f7980bc43a1d928b18c702.png?resize=1280%2C806&#038;ssl=1" width="1280" /></p>

<p>As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin aSOPR had surged to very high levels as the coin had set its <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-breaks-through-69000-setting-new-record/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">new all-time high</a> beyond the $73,000 level. This means that the transactions being made on the network were profit-heavy on average.</p>
<p>With the price drawdown, though, loss-taking also started taking hold as the aSOPR retreated toward the 1.0 level. At this value, the market as a whole is just breaking even on its selling.</p>

<p>&#8220;When positions are stopped out or panic selling is sufficient, we anticipate the market nearing its local bottom,&#8221; notes the quant. This pattern is also visible in the chart, as major bottoms have formed when loss-taking has been dominant.</p>
<p>The 1.0 level itself, however, has been a point where the cryptocurrency has sometimes found rebounds. The most recent example of this trend would be the low back in January, which formed when the aSOPR retested this mark.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $67,000, up 5% in the past week.</p>

<title>Cardano On The Brink: Crypto Analyst Predicts 1,800% Price Explosion To $12</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-1800-price-explosion-12/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-1800-price-explosion-12/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的<br />加密分析师Trend Rider对ADA提出了乐观的论述，认为其将再次上涨并超过其历史最高价。他预测ADA可能升至12美元，指出当前市场情绪正在转为看涨。与此同时，其他分析师也表示看好ADA未来表现。当前ADA价格为0.63美元，已突破20日和50日移动平均线，有望升至0.70美元。ADA在短期目标为0.80至0.83美元，随后可能进一步上涨至下一个关键价位。 <div>
<p>Crypto analyst Trend Rider has provided a bullish narrative for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/swiss-firm-launches-cardano-staking-etp/">Cardano (ADA)</a> despite its relatively unimpressive performance in this bull market. Based on his analysis, ADA will again rise to its <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/major-moves-for-cardano-ada/">all-time high (ATH)</a> and even surpass it. </p>
<h2>Cardano Could Hit A New ATH Of $12</h2>
<p>Trend Rider suggested in an X (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/TrendRidersTR/status/1770441959020093907?s=20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> that ADA could rise to as high as $12 as ADA’s market shifts from a bearish to a bullish sentiment. His analysis focused on ADA’s 2-week chart, which showed that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/the-200-day-moving-average-ma-why-is-it-important-for-bitcoin/">key moving averages</a> are realigning, the analyst claimed. Trend Rider added that this could mark a transition towards a bullish framework as the candlesticks turn green. </p>

<p>He further noted that this move on the charts shares similarities with a previous pattern that played out just before ADA made its run in the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/rewards-2021-bitcoin-bull-buyers-finally-break-even/">last bull market</a>. Meanwhile, although Trend Rider didn’t give a timeframe for this imminent move, he <a href="https://x.com/TrendRidersTR/status/1770447180794401263?s=20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">noted</a> that this was a long-term analysis and warned that ADA investors must be patient while this plays out. </p>
<p>ADA’s recent price action has caused Cardano investors to worry, especially with other crypto tokens recording significant gains. However, Trend Rider’s analysis no doubt provides reassurance that ADA will still have its moment. Dan Gambardello, the founder of Crypto Capital Venture, had also previously <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano/cardano-price-about-to-explode/#:~:text=Gambardello%20mentioned%20in%20a%20video,time%20ADA%20made%20a%20breakout." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">dispelled</a> the notion that ADA won’t perform well in this bull cycle. </p>
<p>Gambardello mentioned that ADA was where it was meant to be before it took off. Like Trend Rider, he also alluded to the 2021 bull run, noting that ADA was lagging at the initial stages of that cycle and didn’t make a significant move to the upside until about two months after <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-breaks-through-69000-setting-new-record/">Bitcoin broke its previous ATH</a>.</p>
<h2>What Next For ADA?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/ada/cardano-ada-price-to-11/#:~:text=According%20to%20him%2C%20this%20is,the%20next%20Bitcoin%20Halving%20event." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Gambardello</a> recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI95woGXrMU&amp;t=1s" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">analyzed</a> ADA’s daily chart and noted that the crypto token had already broken its 20-day and 50-day moving averages. The analyst claimed that a close above the 50-day moving average could see Cardano rise to the $0.70 price range. </p>

<p>Gambaradello also sounded bullish on <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-analyst-sets-5-target-for-cardano-price-how/">ADA’s future trajectory</a>. He stated that the charts showed that ADA was well primed to make a similar one like the one it did in the last cycle. His bullish target for ADA in the short term is the $0.80 to $0.83 price range, as he claimed that is the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-analyst-predicts-1300-for-cardano/">breakout area</a>. </p>
<p>If a breakout were to occur from that price range, then he foresees ADA rising to the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano/cardano-price-about-to-explode/#:~:text=Gambardello%20mentioned%20in%20a%20video,time%20ADA%20made%20a%20breakout." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">$1.40 to $1.50 price range</a> next.  At the time of writing, ADA is trading at around $0.63, up over 8% in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap. </p>

<title>Dogecoin Surges 16% As X Payments Secures 3 New Licenses</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-surges-x-payments-secures-3-new-licenses/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章报道了X Payments公司在美国三个州获得关键的转账许可证，推动了其在美国金融监管领域的扩张，并显示了对法规合规的重视。此外，狗狗币价格上涨了16%，由于Coinbase衍生品计划推出狗狗币期货合约，更加确立了其作为可投资资产的地位。同时，埃隆·马斯克表达了将狗狗币作为购买特斯拉汽车的支付方式的意愿，进一步推动了市场的热情。 <div>
<p>The Dogecoin price is witnessing a strong upswing today, recording an 16% increase as X Payments, under the aegis of Elon Musk, secured pivotal money transmitter licenses across three additional US states. This milestone, first reported via X News Daily on X, includes the acquisition of licenses in Illinois, New Mexico, and Oregon, propelling X Payments into a significant phase of expansion within the United States’ financial regulatory landscape.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">NEWS: X Payments receives 3 more licenses including Illinois, New Mexico and Oregon. <a href="https://t.co/wIMhhFPCwd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/wIMhhFPCwd</a></p>

<p></p>
<h2>Strategic Expansion And Regulatory Compliance</h2>
<p>X Payments LLC’s strategic pursuit of money transmitter licenses underscores its ambition to cement a formidable presence across the US. With these three new licenses, X Payments’ operational footprint now spans 22 states, marking a critical step towards national coverage.</p>

<p>The focused expansion into Illinois, New Mexico, and Oregon, as confirmed on March 20, reflects a calculated approach to navigating the complex web of state-level financial regulations.</p>
<p>Recently, Elon Musk <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/elon-musk-tesla-dogecoin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">revealed</a> in a talk with Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Invest, an ambitious timeline, aiming for the rollout of payment features for X by mid-2024. This forward-looking statement aligns with Musk’s vision of an &#8220;everything app,&#8221; reminiscent of platforms like Chinese WeChat &#8211; an app for financial transactions, social interactions, and multimedia communications.</p>
<p>Notably, X Payments&#8217; registration with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as a money service business (MSB) was another pivotal compliance achievement in recent weeks. This designation is crucial for operating within the US&#8217;s financial ecosystem, ensuring adherence to anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) standards.</p>

<p>The anticipation surrounding X Payments’ potential to integrate cryptocurrencies, notably Dogecoin, into its payment solutions has been a significant catalyst for market movements. The speculative association between X Payments and Dogecoin, fueled by Elon Musk’s well-documented affinity for the memecoin, has had a tangible impact on its valuation and investor sentiment.</p>
<h2>Dogecoin Price Rises By 16%</h2>
<p>Over the past 24 hours, Dogecoin&#8217;s price soared to $0.1551, encapsulating a 16% appreciation. Notably, the bullish trend was further supported by Coinbase Derivatives&#8217; strategic move to launch Dogecoin futures, an initiative greenlit by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). This development not only enhances Dogecoin&#8217;s market liquidity but also legitimizes its status as an investable asset within the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Coinbase Derivatives will launch the first leveraged and CFTC-regulated futures contracts for Bitcoin Cash, Dogecoin, and Litecoin in April!</p>

<p></p>
<p>Last week, Elon Musk <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-gains-momentum-as-musk-hints-at-future-tesla-payments-is-doge-going-to-the-moon/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">remarked</a> his desire to add DOGE as a payment method to purchase Tesla cars in the near future. In a viral X video shared on March 14 capturing Musk’s recent visit to Giga Berlin, the billionaire stated, “When can you buy Tesla with Dogecoin? At some point, I think we should enable that,” Musk added, “You can buy Tesla merch with DOGE, which is cool. So, Dogecoin to the moon.”</p>
<p>In January, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/x-payments-dogecoin-integration/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">establishment</a> of an X Payments account on X signaled intentions to introduce services within the year. Although the XPayments account has remained silent, without any posts, and X has not detailed the specific payment features it intends to roll out, market participants are speculating that Dogecoin (DOGE) may be included in the offerings, a speculation fueled by its sporadic references from the platform&#8217;s proprietor, Elon Musk.</p>

<title>Shiba Inu To Make ‘Miracle Recovery’ To New ATH, SHIB Marketing Lead Says</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-to-make-miracle-recovery-to-new-ath/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-to-make-miracle-recovery-to-new-ath/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章讨论了Shiba Inu（SHIB）代币面临的挑战，包括价格下跌和烧毁率下降。尽管SHIB价格有所回升，团队表达乐观情绪，但分析师仍持谨慎态度。此外，烧毁率下降可能影响未来价格走势，而SHIB的未来发展取决于团队的实力和代币的实用性。Lucie对实现新高有信心，但路径充满挑战。 <div>
<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB), the popular meme coin, finds itself at a crossroads. While the project&#8217;s marketing lead, Lucie, recently expressed bullish sentiment on Twitter, the token&#8217;s price struggles to regain lost ground, and its burn rate has taken a nosedive.</p>

<h2><strong>The &#8216;Miracle&#8217; Rebound Of Shiba Inu</strong></h2>
<p>Lucie made a post on X about her belief that SHIB can pull off a &#8220;miracle recovery&#8221; and reach a new all-time high (ATH) soon. This optimistic outlook comes amidst a period of decline for SHIB.</p>
<p>Since March 14th, the token has shed over 20%, currently trading at roughly 70% below its October 2021 peak. However, Lucie clarifies that her statement is a personal opinion, not an official prediction from the Shiba Inu team.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p></p>
<p>At the time of writing, Shiba Inu was trading at $0.000027, up 5.0% in the last 24 hours, but sustained <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">a 17% drop in value</a> in the last seven days, data from Coingecko shows.</p>
<p>Despite Lucie&#8217;s confidence, analysts remain cautious. The cryptocurrency market is notoriously volatile, and SHIB&#8217;s future hinges on various factors beyond individual pronouncements.</p>
<p>The upcoming Bitcoin halving in April, where the daily production of new Bitcoins is cut in half, is often seen as a potential catalyst for a broader market upswing. However, its impact on SHIB specifically remains to be seen.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/EynfGihk/" width="2475" /></p>

<p>Adding to the concerns is the recent plunge in SHIB&#8217;s burn rate. Initiatives like burning – sending tokens to unspendable wallets, effectively reducing supply – are often employed by meme coin projects to combat their massive supply and potentially drive price increases.</p>
<h2><strong>Shiba Inu Burn Rate Down</strong></h2>
<p>According to Shibburn, a platform tracking SHIB burns, the burn rate has fallen by nearly 73% in the last 24 hours compared to the previous day. This decline could dampen investor enthusiasm, as a lower burn rate weakens the argument for future price appreciation.</p>

<p>SHIB&#8217;s current market position also presents a challenge. While it sits comfortably at 11th place in terms of market capitalization, it&#8217;s nipping at the heels of its bigger meme coin brother, Dogecoin (DOGE), which holds the 10th spot on CoinMarketCap.</p>
<p>Both tokens have benefited from social media hype and celebrity endorsements in the past, but replicating that level of excitement might prove difficult.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the success of Shiba Inu hinges on several key factors. The team&#8217;s ability to deliver on its development promises, reignite community engagement, and potentially find utility cases for the token beyond its meme coin status will be crucial.</p>
<p>Lucie&#8217;s optimism might spark a flicker of hope for SHIB holders, but the path to a new ATH remains paved with challenges.</p>

The exchange asserts that Dogecoin has transcended from its status as a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/meme-coin-madness-sends-ethereum-fees-soaring/">meme coin</a>, emerging as a prominent digital asset within the evolving crypto market. </p>
<h2>Coinbase To List Dogecoin In Futures Contract</h2>
<p>In a series of <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/k3n74unfin40/2RTxHc9xRZVFMDZnhmSFex/5745e3ed14b134efeac48b2a0759b7d3/2024-8_Listing_of_DOG_Futures.docx.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">letters</a> addressed to the United States <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cftcs-landmark-year-crypto-cases-account-for-2023/">Commodity Future Trading Commission (CFTC)</a>, Coinbase Derivatives, a Designated Contract Market (DCM), revealed intentions to list Dogecoin in its futures contract. The crypto exchange had relayed its plan to incorporate Dogecoin into its cash-settled <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-volatility-713-carnage-crypto-futures/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">future contract products</a> as early as Thursday, March 7. </p>

<p>Notably, the derivatives exchange has revealed that Dogecoin futures contracts will be available to trade on its platform on or by Monday, April 1, 2024. This move marks a pivotal moment for DOGE, which has been viewed as a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/why-shiba-inu-pepe-dogecoin-are-far-from-done/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">humorous meme coin</a> since its inception. </p>
<p>Coinbase has also justified its decision to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-coinbase-bitcoin-dogecoin/">list Dogecoin</a> by claiming that the cryptocurrency has evolved beyond the title of a meme coin, highlighting the cryptocurrency’s growing influence and value in the market. The exchange’s announcement also comes at a time when <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-gains-momentum-as-musk-hints-at-future-tesla-payments-is-doge-going-to-the-moon/">DOGE&#8217;s popularity</a> and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-price-highest-level/">price dynamics</a> have been growing stronger. </p>
<p>“Dogecoin’s enduring popularity and the active community support suggest that it has transcended its origins as a meme to become a staple of the cryptocurrency world,” the exchange wrote. </p>
<p>More interestingly, Coinbase’s letters to the CFTC have indicated that the derivatives exchange may proceed with listing <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-open-interest-record-2/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dogecoin futures contracts</a> before obtaining formal approval from the US agency. Additionally, the crypto exchange has disclosed its intention to utilize the self-certification method to launch the futures contract. </p>
<p>In light of these, Dogecoin is not the only cryptocurrency set to receive a listing by Coinbase. Popular cryptocurrencies like <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/litecoin/litecoin-beats-out-dogecoin-bitcoin-to-emerge-as-top-crypto-for-payments/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Litecoin (LTC)</a> and <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/bch/bitcoin-cash-price-gains-282/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Bitcoin Cash (BCH)</a> have been included in Coinbase’s futures contract plans, with trading expected to commence by April 1, if no objections are made by the CFTC. </p>
<h2>From Meme To Mainstream</h2>
<p>Dogecoin, originally created as a joke based on the popular <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/forget-dogecoin-shiba-inu-set-to-become-the-top-dog-expert-predicts-100-billion-market-cap/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Shiba Inu</a> dog, has continually defied expectations, gaining substantial traction and recognition within the crypto market over the years. Despite its <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/company/from-meme-to-millions-the-dogecoin-revolution-in-australian-online-casinos/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">meme coin origins</a>, the cryptocurrency has developed a strong reputation and <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin-orbit-expands-over-890000-new-addresses-join-doge-community/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">cultivated a dedicated community of supporters</a> and enthusiasts who have contributed greatly to its development by propelling its adoption and value to great heights. </p>

<p>Coinbase’s decision to incorporate DOGE into its futures contracts reflects the cryptocurrency’s growing acceptance within the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-when-dogecoin-does-this/">mainstream digital asset market</a>. By listing the popular doggy-themed cryptocurrency in its futures contract, Coinbase not only expands its impressive product offerings but also grants its users access to Dogecoin, providing additional avenues for trading and investing. </p>

<title>Bitcoin Surges Back Above $67,000 As Buyers Return On Coinbase</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-surges-back-67000-buyers-return-coinbase/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。比特币在过去一天中出现了显着的回升，数据显示购买压力已经回归到加密货币交易所Coinbase上。Coinbase的比特币溢价已经再次转为正值，显示出美国机构投资者的购买压力增加。这一指标显示了美国机构投资者与全球投资者之间的购买行为差异。随着溢价值的回升，比特币价格也有了显着的恢复。这对于监测资产可能是值得继续关注的，因为任何变化可能会反映在资产价值上。

 <div>
<p>Bitcoin has made some notable recovery in the past day as data suggests buying pressure has returned on the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Has Flipped Back To Positive</h2>
<p>As pointed out by CryptoQuant Netherlands community manager Maartunn in a <a href="https://twitter.com/JA_Maartun/status/1770578250579816549" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap has surged back into the positive territory.</p>
<p>The &#8220;<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-coinbase-premium-gap-green-why-this-bullish/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Coinbase Premium Gap</a>&#8221; here refers to a metric that keeps track of the difference between the BTC prices listed on Coinbase (USD pair) and Binance (USDT pair).</p>

<p>What this indicator tells us about is how the buying (or selling) behaviors differ between the userbases of the two platforms. The users of the exchanges would have some overlap, of course, but there is one key difference between them: the former platform is the preferred one for US-based <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-breaks-52000-institutional-buying-continues/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">institutional entities</a>.</p>
<p>This means that the premium&#8217;s value can provide hints about whether these humongous American traders are buying more or less than the global investors Binance hosts.</p>
<p>Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap over the past few days:</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="2580" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GJJbiKvW8AASRQv?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096" width="4096" /></p>

<p>As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap had turned significantly red earlier. Alongside these negative values, BTC observed a steep decline that took its value as low as $60,600. This pattern implies that the selling pressure from American institutional investors may have played a role in the drawdown cryptocurrency went through.</p>
<p>And indeed, the trend is actually in line with what has been observed this year so far, as the Coinbase Premium Gap has appeared to have been guiding the price throughout. It would seem that BTC&#8217;s price action in this <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etf-fee-war-grayscale-ceo-says-gbtc-fees-will-drop-over-time/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">post-ETF environment</a> is being notably influenced by the institutional entities.</p>
<p>From the chart, it&#8217;s visible that the indicator&#8217;s value has turned back green in the past day and just like the red values accompanied a net decline, this buying pressure has led to the coin registering some sharp recovery.</p>
<p>These positive premium levels have come as the US Federal Reserve has revealed in its latest meeting that the interest rates would remain unchanged for now and that there would still only be three cuts in the year ahead.</p>

<p>Given the relationship that the Bitcoin spot price and Coinbase Premium Gap have apparently held in this first quarter of 2024, the metric may be worth continuing to monitor, as any changes in it may reflect on the asset.</p>
<p>Should the current positive values of the indictor persist, BTC may become likely to further its surge, as it would mean that the large investors are backing the rally.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>So far in Bitcoin&#8217;s recovery since the Coinbase Premium Gap has turned positive, the asset has managed to climb back towards the $67,000 level.</p>

<title>Montenegro Orders Do Kwon Extradition To South Korea – Details</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/montenegro-orders-do-kwon-extradition-to-s-korea/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/montenegro-orders-do-kwon-extradition-to-s-korea/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要: 这些信息是消极的。文章介绍了TerraForm Labs创始人Do Kwon与2022年Terra生态系统崩溃的关联，以及Montenegro上诉法院拒绝将其引渡至美国。Kwon失踪后被捕，目前面临韩国指控优先于美国。投资者失去大笔资金，美国可能会继续追究Kwon的诈骗指控。该案突显了加密货币领域的法律复杂性，全球加密社区期待这一案件的发展。 <div>
<p>Do Kwon, the beleaguered founder of TerraForm Labs, is <a href="https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/2024-03-21/business/finance/Montenegro-court-confirms-extradition-of-disgraced-crypto-mogul-Do-Kwon-to-Korea/2007542" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">headed to South Korea to face charges</a> connected to the 2022 Terra ecosystem collapse. This follows a Montenegrin appeals court rejecting his final attempt to be extradited to the United States.</p>
<p>The decision marks the culmination of a months-long legal battle where both South Korea and the US sought Kwon&#8217;s extradition. Kwon, once hailed as the &#8220;cryptocurrency king,&#8221; vanished after the dramatic downfall of his crypto project Terra, which resulted in <a href="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2024/03/602_371135.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">billions of dollars lost by investors</a>. He was eventually apprehended in Montenegro last year while attempting to flee with forged travel documents.</p>

<h2><strong>Do Kwon Attorney Says Case Is &#8216;Finally Settled&#8217;</strong></h2>
<p>According to Kwon&#8217;s lawyer, Goran Rodic, the extradition case is &#8220;finally settled.&#8221; The Montenegrin court&#8217;s ruling hinged on the earlier submission date of South Korea&#8217;s extradition request compared to the US&#8217;s. Prioritization based on timing is standard practice in international extradition cases, and the court determined South Korea had a stronger claim due to the earlier request.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Montenegro’s courts confirm a ruling that South Korea’s extradition demand for disgraced crypto mogul Do Kwon has priority over a similar demand by the US <a href="https://t.co/abYfIAy9Ee" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://t.co/abYfIAy9Ee</a></p>
<p>— Bloomberg Markets (@markets) <a href="https://twitter.com/markets/status/1770467154099331163?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">March 20, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Legal experts view this development as significant. While specifics of the charges Kwon faces in South Korea remain undisclosed, the Montenegrin court&#8217;s decision suggests they believe South Korea is the primary jurisdiction where alleged crimes occurred.</p>
<p>Although Do Kwon will face the South Korean justice system first, the US may still pursue its own charges. American authorities suspect Kwon of fraud and other financial crimes related to the Terra collapse. Experts predict the US will continue its case against Kwon, potentially seeking his extradition from South Korea after he faces initial charges there.</p>
<p>This could be a protracted legal battle spanning multiple continents. The outcome of Kwon&#8217;s South Korean case will undoubtedly influence the US&#8217;s strategy.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/3jYLOs4j/" width="2475" /></p>

<p>The news deals a blow to investors who lost significant sums in the Terra ecosystem collapse. Many had hoped Kwon would face US courts, believing the American justice system would deliver harsher penalties. South Korea&#8217;s legal framework for cryptocurrency-related offenses is still evolving, raising concerns about the potential consequences Kwon might face.</p>

<h2><strong>Legal Complexities Surrounding Crypto Arena</strong></h2>
<p>South Korean investor groups impacted by the Terra collapse are likely calling for the full accountability of Do Kwon. They urge South Korean authorities to hold him accountable to the fullest extent of the law.</p>
<p>Kwon&#8217;s case highlights the legal complexities surrounding the burgeoning world of cryptocurrency. Regulatory frameworks struggle to keep pace with the rapid innovation in the crypto space, leaving questions about jurisdiction and accountability for large-scale financial losses.</p>
<p>As Do Kwon prepares for extradition, the global crypto community awaits the next chapter in this saga. Investors seek restitution, while regulators grapple with the challenge of ensuring transparency and accountability within the evolving digital financial landscape.</p>

<title>Shiba Inu Team Just Dropped The Latest SHIB Magazine, Here’s The 411</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-latest-shib-magazine/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-latest-shib-magazine/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。Shiba Inu团队最近发布了最新一期的杂志，介绍了他们在发展中取得的成就。重点包括Shiba Inu与Binance Pay的合作，Marswap聚合器的推出，SHIB名称服务的成功以及SHEB代币的受欢迎程度。总体而言，团队的创新和合作关系正在为Shiba Inu带来巨大成功。 <div>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-investing-meme-coins/">The Shiba Inu (SHIB) team</a> recently released the latest edition of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-team-shib-magazine/">’The Shib’ magazine</a>. As expected, it features exciting updates from the team on milestones achieved in their quest to grow the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shibarium-99-decline/">ecosystem</a>. </p>
<h2>Shiba Inu’s Partnership With Binance Pay</h2>
<p>The Shiba Inu team drew the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shib-grayscale-shiba-inu-etf/">SHIB community’s</a> attention to the fact that the SHIB token is already on <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-pay-launches-in-brazil-enabling-merchants/">Binance Pay</a>, Binance’s payment service. They highlighted how this integration has benefited the meme coin and Binance. The number of Binance pay transactions made in SHIB is said to have grown 30% year-on-year from 2022 to 2023. </p>

<p>SHIB was also in the top 6 most popular Binance Pay transaction currencies by transaction count in 2022 and 2023. The team acknowledged that Binance Pay provided much-needed visibility for the meme coin “when crypto was still struggling to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-winter-over-morgan-stanley-april-2024/">come out of the crypto winter</a>.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, seeing as how this partnership has so far been beneficial, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-team-shib-burn/">Shiba Inu team</a> also used the opportunity to urge members of the community, especially those who have yet to do so, to keep using Binance Pay. They further highlighted the benefits of using the payment service and the convenience it provides. </p>
<p>In a subsequent post on the magazine, the team put the spotlight on Marswap aggregator, Shibarium’s foremost aggregator. Having just launched, Marswap has promised to slash trading costs on the Shibarium network by 15%. These reduced trading costs can help increase trading activity on the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shibarium-public/">layer-2 network</a> if eventually accomplished. </p>
<p>Marswap’s launch is also timely, considering that Bitcoinist <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shibarium-99-decline/">recently reported</a> that Shibarium is experiencing a 99% decline in daily transactions recorded. </p>
<h2>Shiba Inu Records Success With Name Service</h2>
<p>As highlighted in the magazine, the SHIB name service <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shib-name-service-launch/">launched</a> about two weeks ago has been a success. The demand for this service is said to have exceeded expectations, with thousands of registrations pouring in from <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-8-billion-shib-burned/#:~:text=Over%208%20Billion%20Shiba%20Inu%20Burned%20In%20The%20Last%2024%20Hours&amp;text=As%20a%20result%20of%20this,transferred%20to%20a%20dead%20wallet." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">members of the SHIB community</a>. Interestingly, the premium names have been highly coveted despite costing more, with a starting price point of $50 per name. </p>

<p>The team also revealed in the magazine that public access to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-game-changing/">Shib Names</a> is scheduled for March 26, after which the D3 Marketplace will launch. Once the marketplace launches, users will be able to trade their Shiba names. </p>
<p>SHEB, the token representing the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-ethereum-erc-404-nft/">‘SHEboshis’ NFT</a> (non-fungible token) collection, is another of the team’s innovations that are enjoying immense success. SHEB was recently listed on CoinW, a leading trading platform, and is said to be rapidly gaining popularity. Since being listed on the platform, the ERC-404 token has ranked among the trending crypto tokens every week. </p>

<title>Primary Threat To XRP Ledger Uncovered, Guess What It Is?</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/primary-threat-to-xrp-ledger-uncovered/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/primary-threat-to-xrp-ledger-uncovered/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。<br />文章指出了有关Ripple对XRP Ledger的潜在威胁的争议。有人声称Ripple正在采取措施来隐藏其XRP销售，引入EVM侧链可能是为了提高匿名性。然而，Ripple的CTO否认了这些指控，并表示在加密交易所出售代币比在区块链上更容易匿名。文章还讨论了之前有关美国证券交易委员会裁定XRP为证券的情况。关于Ripple使用EVM以增加匿名性的争议仍在继续。 <div>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/secs-new-rules-sparks-trouble-for-xrp-ledger-amm/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">XRP Ledger</a> and Ripple are at a fork in the road, as several speculations regarding Ripple being the major threat to the XRPL emerge within the cryptocurrency community questioning the independence of the initiative. The XRP Ledger is well-known for its speed, security, and low transaction fees reaching multiple significant milestones since it was introduced.</p>
<h2>Ripple Emerges As XRP Ledger&#8217;s Biggest Threat</h2>
<p>In a heated <a href="https://x.com/offledger/status/1770375255179296956?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">conversation</a>, Onledger asserted that the &#8220;greatest threat to the XRP ledger is the team everyone idolizes (Ripple),&#8221; and is presently looking to inflict additional harm by hiding its XRP sales through the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-sidechain-xrp-ledger-close-to-launch/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) sidechain.</a></p>

<p>Onledger further claimed that there is &#8220;no other explanation&#8221; for why the payment firm is rushing with hooks unless &#8220;XAHAU and hooks pose a threat.&#8221; Although Hooks would provide smart contract capability to the XRPL, it is important to note that Ripple has demonstrated prudence in this regard.</p>
<p>The post read:</p>
<blockquote><p>Been saying it for ages. The team that everyone looks up to, Ripple, poses the greatest threat to the XRPL. They will now use EVM to shit on everyone even more. There is no other reason why they are suddenly using hooks except because XAHAU and hooks pose a threat.</p></blockquote>
<p>According to Onledger, the only reason why Ripple is thinking about implementing an EVM sidechain is hooks. Moreover, they claim that the payment company is adopting the EVM sidechain in order to &#8220;wrap its XRP and sell it off anonymously.&#8221; However, this was something they were unable to accomplish while utilizing &#8220;native smart contract capability.&#8221; As a result, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-vs-sec-crucial-dates-2024/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ripple</a> is now quiet about the EVM sidechain, which is why no one has come across anyone willing to &#8220;run witness servers.&#8221; </p>
<p>Ripple Chief Technology Officer (CTO) David Schwartz has weighed in on the subject, refuting Onledger&#8217;s claims. In response to the allegations, Schwartz stated that the financial firm would not need to take such drastic measures if it truly intended to conceal its XRP sales over time. &#8220;Ripple can sell as many tokens as we want on crypto exchanges with less responsibility than selling them on blockchains,&#8221; Schwartz stated.</p>
<h2>Exchanges Do Not Provide Anonymity</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, Onledger disputes <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-tokens-vs-ripple-shares-cto-david-schwartz-reveals-his-choice/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Schwartz</a>&#8216;s statement saying that &#8220;cryptocurrency exchanges do not provide for Ripple&#8217;s anonymity,&#8221; while drawing attention to a previous statement made by the CTO regarding the firm&#8217;s ODL-related sales with a United States Nexus.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that in July 2023, concerns about sales related to ODL were raised when a US court ruled in favor of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and declared that XRP, which Ripple offers institutional investors, is a security.</p>
<p>Onledger believes that Ripple is utilizing the EVM to make their operations anonymous. However, Schwartz once again responded, saying that &#8220;no one else knows who we are, but the exchanges do.&#8221;</p>

<title>Ethereum In Regulatory Hot Seat: SEC Security Classification Looms</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-in-the-hot-seat-sec-security-label-looms/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-in-the-hot-seat-sec-security-label-looms/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要: 这些信息是消极的。<br />以太坊的地位充满不确定性，因为美国证券交易委员会正在对以太坊基金会进行调查。调查可能旨在将以太坊的本土代币以太（ETH）分类为证券，这可能会对加密货币市场产生重大影响。调查始于2022年9月的以太坊向股权证明模型的过渡后，SEC可能认为这一变化可能加强了以太坊作为证券的可能性。不确定性也影响着加密货币行业的其他方面，包括机构投资和以太期货市场。SEC对以太坊的分类决定将对整个加密货币市场产生深远影响。 <div>
<p>The status of Ethereum, the world&#8217;s second-largest cryptocurrency, is shrouded in uncertainty as the US Securities and Exchange Commission probes the Ethereum Foundation.</p>
<p>Industry insiders believe the investigation is aimed at classifying Ether (ETH), Ethereum&#8217;s native token, as a security, a move that could significantly impact the cryptocurrency market.</p>

<h2><strong>Ethereum&#8217;s Regulatory Landscape: Recent Developments</strong></h2>
<p>This development comes amidst a flurry of activity surrounding Ethereum. Major financial institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity have applied for spot Ether ETFs, while the controversial firm Prometheum seeks to offer Ether custody under SEC oversight. However, the SEC&#8217;s recent actions cast a shadow over these efforts.</p>
<p>Companies subpoenaed by the SEC have disclosed that the investigation began shortly after Ethereum&#8217;s transition to a proof-of-stake model in September 2022.</p>
<p>The SEC, according to a<a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/03/20/sec-gary-gensler-ethereum-security-commodity-crypto-foundation/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> report by Fortune,</a> might view this shift as strengthening the case for Ether being a security, as proof-of-stake involves users staking their coins to validate transactions, potentially resembling an investment contract.</p>
<p>The SEC&#8217;s stance on <a href="https://qz.com/sec-ether-security-crypto-regulation-1851353565" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Ethereum&#8217;s classification</a> has been historically ambiguous. In 2018, then-Director of Corporation Finance William Hinman declared Ether wasn&#8217;t a security. However, the agency&#8217;s current Chair, Gary Gensler, has expressed a more skeptical view. He has suggested proof-of-stake tokens could be securities, though he&#8217;s avoided directly mentioning Ethereum.</p>
<p>Adding to the confusion, the SEC approved several Bitcoin futures ETFs in January 2023, while the CFTC (Commodity Futures Trading Commission) oversees Ether futures markets. This seemingly contradictory approach suggests the SEC might have a different view on Bitcoin and Ether.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/OVKEPuij/" width="1835" /></p>

<h2><strong>Implications of Ether&#8217;s Security Classification</strong></h2>
<p>Further muddying the waters is Prometheum&#8217;s move. This firm, already approved as a special purpose broker-dealer, plans to offer Ether custody as a security. Some speculate this could be a strategic maneuver to influence the SEC&#8217;s decision, potentially acting as a &#8220;Trojan Horse&#8221; for security classification.</p>
<p>The investigation&#8217;s outcome has major implications. Classifying<a href="https://www.binance.com/en/square/post/2024-03-21-sec-investigates-ethereum-classification-as-security-5677499263385" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> Ether as a security</a> would subject it to stricter regulations, potentially hindering its growth and impacting existing Ether futures markets. Additionally, it could discourage the approval of spot Ether ETFs, a major blow to institutional adoption.</p>
<p>The situation highlights the ongoing regulatory uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrencies. The SEC&#8217;s aggressive approach under Gensler appears aimed at exerting greater control over the industry. However, the lack of clear communication and potential inconsistencies within the SEC itself create confusion and hinder innovation.</p>

<p>The coming months will be crucial for Ethereum. The SEC&#8217;s investigation and its ultimate decision on Ether&#8217;s classification will have ripple effects throughout the cryptocurrency market. Investors and industry players eagerly await clarity, hoping for a regulatory framework that fosters responsible development within the crypto ecosystem.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Tokenization is at the heart of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-private-bitcoin-event/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">BlackRock&#8217;s digital asset strategy</a>, with BUIDL enabling the issuance and trading of ownership on the Ethereum blockchain. This approach not only widens access to on-chain offerings but also ensures instantaneous and transparent settlement, along with interoperability across platforms, courtesy of BNY Mellon.</p>

<p>Carlos Domingo, co-founder and CEO of Securitize, emphasized the transformative potential of tokenization in capital markets, noting, &#8220;Today’s news demonstrates that traditional financial products are being made more accessible through digitization.&#8221;</p>
<p>BUIDL is designed to maintain a stable value of $1 per token, distributing daily accrued dividends directly to investors&#8217; wallets as new tokens each month. The fund primarily invests in cash, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/tether-72-5-billion-in-treaury-bills-investement/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">US Treasury bills</a>, and repurchase agreements, ensuring a secure yield for token holders on the blockchain.</p>
<p>Moreover, the ecosystem for BUIDL includes prestigious names like Anchorage Digital Bank NA, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitgo-ceo-coinbase-major-obstacle-bitcoin-etf/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">BitGo</a>, Coinbase, and Fireblocks, setting a solid foundation for the fund&#8217;s operations.</p>
<p>The strategic collaboration extends beyond product launch, with BlackRock making a strategic investment in Securitize and appointing Joseph Chalom, its Global Head of Strategic Ecosystem Partnerships, to Securitize’s Board of Directors.</p>

<p>This initiative represents a critical juncture in the evolution of digital assets, signaling the increasing integration of blockchain technology with traditional financial instruments. The fund&#8217;s tokenized structure offers a glimpse into the future of investment, where accessibility, transparency, and efficiency reign supreme.</p>
<h2>Ethereum Community Rejoices Euphorically</h2>
<p>Reactions from the Ethereum community have been overwhelmingly positive, with industry figures like Anthony Sassano and Ryan Berckmans citing the launch as a bullish signal for both Ethereum and the broader crypto market.</p>
<p>Sassano, founder of the The Daily Gwei, <a href="https://twitter.com/sassal0x/status/1770613618423587232" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">remarked</a>, &#8220;BlackRock launching a yield-bearing stablecoin on Ethereum is still one of the most bullish things to ever happen in crypto and the market has definitely not digested this yet,&#8221; underscoring the significant impact of such a move.</p>
<p>Ryan Berckmans <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanberckmans/status/1770606156337008788" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">stated</a>, “BUIDL seeks to offer a stable value of $1 per token and pays daily accrued dividends directly to investors&#8217; wallets as new tokens each month. I hadn&#8217;t realized that BlackRock launched *a yield-bearing stablecoin* on ETH. Yield-bearing stables are apex products. Very bullish.”</p>
<p>Seraphim Czecker, head of growth at Ethena Labs <a href="https://twitter.com/MacroMate8/status/1770717598663016660" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">added</a> his excitement, stating, “Freaking Blackrock launched a yield bearing stablecoin and you’re not bullish on crypto. We have come a long way.”</p>
<p>At press time, ETH traded at $3,549.</p>

<title>Cardano Luminary Foresees Technological Revolution By 2030</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-luminary-hoskinson-foresees-technological-revolution-by-2030/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-luminary-hoskinson-foresees-technological-revolution-by-2030/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章探讨了Charles Hoskinson对未来PC游戏能力的大胆预测，预计到2030年，游戏PC将能够比当前最强大的超级计算机快1000倍运行模型。文章还讨论了Cardano加密货币在游戏中的潜在影响，以及Web3游戏中的关键挑战和失败率。最后，文章提出了游戏行业未来的可能发展方向，强调游戏体验的重要性。 <div>
<p>In the ever-evolving world of gaming, the horizon seems to be expanding at an exponential rate, promising groundbreaking advancements that might redefine the very essence of gaming itself.</p>
<p>Charles Hoskinson, the mastermind behind the Cardano blockchain platform, has stirred up a storm of speculation among gamers with his audacious prophecy: the future of PC gaming might just eclipse the capabilities of today&#8217;s most powerful supercomputers.</p>

<h2><strong>Cardano Visionary&#8217;s Bold Prediction</strong></h2>
<p>This bold prediction has sparked a discourse around the potential trajectory of computing power and its implications for the gaming landscape.</p>
<p>Hoskinson envisions a future, perhaps as soon as 2030, where optimized hardware and cutting-edge models will catapult gaming experiences into uncharted territories.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Here&#8217;s my prediction, by 2030 we will be able to run a model 1000x more power than Mixtral on a gaming PC due to specialized hardware and model optimization</p>
<p>— Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) <a href="https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1770414805788078439?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">March 20, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>The prospect of running computations at speeds a thousand times faster than current capabilities is tantalizing, suggesting a realm where hyper-realistic graphics, intricate physics simulations, and AI adversaries that learn and adapt in real-time become the norm rather than the exception. It&#8217;s a vision that holds the promise of immersive experiences previously only dreamed of.</p>
<p>However, amidst the excitement, skepticism looms large. Can such a grandiose vision materialize into reality, or is it merely an elusive fantasy?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/1PgUAk7T/" width="1835" /></p>

<p>While tech enthusiasts like Kurt, hailing from Sydney, lend credence to Hoskinson&#8217;s vision, citing the relentless march of progress in graphics technology, others remain cautious, wary of potential pitfalls on the road to technological utopia.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I agree &#8211; the AI bubble won&#8217;t be with AI software; it will be with the hardware. These models are already becoming so efficient. Just look at image generation in the last 24 months. It is continuously getting better, and I am still running the exact same 2080ti, and it&#8217;s only…</p>

<p></p>
<h2><strong>Cardano: Influence On The Future of Gaming</strong></h2>
<p>The conversation takes an intriguing turn as cryptocurrency enters the fray. Some Cardano investors propose the integration of ADA, Cardano&#8217;s native token, into popular titles like Call of Duty for in-game purchases.</p>
<p>The notion of earning cryptocurrency through gameplay adds a new layer of intrigue to the discussion. Yet, amidst the allure of digital currencies, questions arise about the feasibility and implications of such integration within mainstream gaming.</p>
<p>This leads us to a sobering reality check: the landscape of Web3 gaming, often dubbed &#8220;GameFi,&#8221; is fraught with challenges. Reports indicate a staggering 76% failure rate among emerging Web3 games launched in the past five years.</p>
<p>The emphasis on the &#8220;play-to-earn&#8221; model, prioritizing cryptocurrency-driven revenue over compelling gameplay experiences, appears to be a significant contributing factor to this high failure rate.</p>
<strong>Cardano And Gaming: What Lies Ahead?</strong>
<p>So, what lies ahead for the future of gaming? The tantalizing prospect of unprecedented processing power holds the promise of transcendent gaming experiences.</p>

<p>Yet, the success of crypto integration within mainstream gaming hinges on a delicate balance between innovation and preservation, where engaging gameplay takes precedence over financial gains.</p>
<p>As the gaming industry navigates these uncharted waters, the stewardship of tech luminaries like Hoskinson ensures that the soul of gaming endures, even in the face of technological upheaval.</p>

<title>Ethereum Is Not A Security, SEC Probe Unlikely To Succeed: A16z</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-not-security-sec-probe-a16z/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的<br />瑞士以太坊基金会收到了一份“自愿询问”的询问，要求保密。福布斯的报道称，美国证券交易委员会（SEC）正在对以太坊基金会进行调查，特别是在以太坊从PoW过渡到PoS模型后。A16z的布赖恩·昆滕兹反对SEC的调查，并指出以太坊应被视为商品而非证券。Coinbase首席法律官保罗·格雷瓦尔也支持以太坊被分类为商品，而不是证券的立场。 ETH目前的价格为$3507。 <div>
<p>The crypto industry finds itself at a pivotal juncture as the Swiss Ethereum Foundation received a &#8220;voluntary enquiry&#8221; from an undisclosed &#8220;state authority&#8221; which demanded confidentiality, as Bitcoinist reported yesterday. This revelation, made through the removal of the Warrant Canary from its website and a note in a Github repository, marks a first in the foundation&#8217;s history.</p>
<p>A little later, a <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/03/20/sec-gary-gensler-ethereum-security-commodity-crypto-foundation/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">report</a> by Forbes surfaced, claiming that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is the agency, trying to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/vitalik-buterin-claps-back-at-the-ethereum-is-a-security-argument/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">declare ETH as a security</a>. This action comes in the wake of the SEC&#8217;s approval of Bitcoin ETFs in January and the looming mid-May deadline for spot ETH Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs).</p>
<p>The SEC&#8217;s inquiry seeks extensive documentation from US companies on their interactions with the Ethereum Foundation, particularly after Ethereum&#8217;s <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/talking-heads-proof-of-stake-ethereum/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">transition to a Proof of Stake (PoS) </a>model. Seemingly, the SEC&#8217;s probe of the Ethereum Foundation aims to categorize Ether as a security, particularly after Ethereum&#8217;s transition to a PoS in September 2022.</p>
<h2>A16z SEC&#8217;s Security Probe Into Ethereum</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://twitter.com/BrianQuintenz/status/1770541125847416943" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">response</a> to the SEC’s actions, Brian Quintenz, Global Head of Policy at Andreessen Horowitz (A16z), a leading venture capital firm with significant investments in the crypto space and $35 billion assets under management, has vocally opposed the SEC&#8217;s attempt. Quintenz, through a series of statements on X (formerly Twitter), laid out a cogent argument against the SEC&#8217;s probe.</p>

<p>Quintenz stated, &#8220;Reminder: When the SEC allowed ETH Futures ETFs to trade on its regulated security exchanges, it explicitly acknowledged the status of the underlying, ETH, as being a non-security and outside of its jurisdiction.&#8221;</p>
<p>He further elaborated on the significance of the SEC&#8217;s decision post-Ethereum&#8217;s transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) model, saying, &#8220;Importantly, this [futures] ETF approval decision in October 2023 occurred well after Ethereum changed to PoS in Sept of 2022; meaning that to the SEC, ETH, in its present state as of Oct 2023, was not a security.&#8221;</p>
<p>Quintenz argues that any doubts regarding Ethereum&#8217;s regulatory treatment should have been resolved with the futures ETF approval, indicating a clear stance from the SEC that Ethereum does not fall under its jurisdiction as a security.</p>

<p>Highlighting the potential contradictions in the SEC&#8217;s approach, Quintenz pointed out, &#8220;If the SEC had any doubt about the regulatory treatment of ETH in Oct 2023, it wouldn’t have approved the ETF. If ETH were in fact a security, then the CFTC-listed futures contracts (on which the ETFs were based) would be illegal, as any derivative on ETH would be considered security futures contracts and subject to different rules, listed on different exchanges and subject to joint SEC/CFTC jurisdiction.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Coinbase CLO Weighs In</h2>
<p>Echoing Quintenz&#8217;s sentiments, Paul Grewal, Coinbase Chief Legal Officer (CLO), reinforced Ethereum&#8217;s classification as a commodity rather than a security. Grewal took to X, articulating, &#8220;Millions of Americans hold ETH; it has been vital to crypto since its 2015 launch; and ETH is a commodity, not a security.&#8221;</p>
<p>He backed his argument with references to previous statements by SEC officials and the consistent position of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and federal courts. Notably, Grewal argued, &#8220;Ex. C. And even very recently, the SEC’s trial lawyers continue to compare ETH to BTC,&#8221; indicating a longstanding regulatory perspective that diverges from the current SEC probe.</p>
<p>The crux of the argument against Ethereum&#8217;s classification as a security lies in the application of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/us-congress-grills-yellen-on-crypto-regulation/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Howey Test</a>, a legal standard used to determine whether certain transactions qualify as investment contracts. Grewal contended, &#8220;Even if we were to apply Howey, ETH utterly fails that test, and nothing about the merge changes that conclusion.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Sigh&#8230; again with the ETH misinformation as we await a decision on ETH ETPs. Ok&#8211;let’s talk about some basic facts about Ethereum. Millions of Americans hold ETH; it has been vital to crypto since its 2015 launch; and ETH is a commodity, not a security. 1/10</p>

<title>The Billion-Dollar Bitcoin Clean-Up: How A UK Woman Laundered $6B From A Chinese Fraud Scheme</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/the-billion-dollar-bitcoin-clean-up-how-a-uk-woman/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。<br />伦敦一起案件揭示了一名英国女子涉嫌洗钱比特币，与一起价值近60亿美元的中国诈骗案有关。42岁的简雯被判洗钱罪，牵涉到隐藏来自中国逃犯的资金，引起了执法机构的关注。审判揭示了洗钱操作的复杂性，以及简雯的生活方式迅速变化，而比特币的价值也出现了下降。 <div>
<p>In a case unraveling in London, a jury has <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/uk-woman-guilty-of-laundering-bitcoin-linked-to-6-billion-china-fraud-1.2049417" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">convicted</a> a UK woman of laundering Bitcoin connected to an extensive fraud scheme originating from China, valued at nearly $6 billion.</p>
<p>The case, which has captured the attention of law enforcement, sheds light on the methods criminals use to exploit digital currencies for illicit activities.</p>

<h2>The Verdict And Its Implications</h2>
<p>42-year-old British citizen Jian Wen was implicated in facilitating the concealment of funds for a Chinese national, identified as a &#8220;fugitive&#8221; responsible for &#8220;orchestrating&#8221; a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-laundering-north-korean-tornado-cash/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">massive investment fraud</a> of nearly $6 billion.</p>
<p>From 2017 to 2022, Wen played a critical role in this operation, which has now been brought to light following an investigation by the London police.</p>
<p>The seizure of more than £1.7 billion ($2.2 billion) in <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-see-more-pullback-think-quant-explains-why/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin</a> in 2018 from a residence shared by Wen and the accused &#8220;mastermind,&#8221; Zhimin Qian, marked a significant milestone in the case, highlighting the scale of the illicit activities.</p>
<p>After an exhaustive trial, the jury found Jian Wen guilty of one count of money laundering while remaining undecided on two additional charges. The Crown Prosecution Service has decided not to seek a retrial for the unresolved charges, focusing instead on the significant conviction already achieved.</p>
<p>Wen, who consistently denied any wrongdoing, argued through her defense that she was unaware of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/tether-usdts-role-in-money-laundering-on-the-rise/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">fraudulent origins</a> of the funds she handled. Her sentencing is scheduled for May 10.</p>
<h2>A Web Of Bitcoin Fraud And Luxury</h2>
<p>The trial exposed the intricacies of the money laundering operation and the rapid transformation in Wen&#8217;s lifestyle, which raised eyebrows. Once working at a fast-food takeaway, Wen&#8217;s association with Zhimin Qian catapulted her into a world of luxury, marked by abundant living and international travel, a stark contrast to her previous life.</p>
<p>This lifestyle shift, fuelled by the proceeds of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-firms-now-included-in-ebas-latest-aml/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">fraudulent scheme</a>, served as a key piece of evidence for understanding the depth of the operation. Zhimin Qian, described as a &#8220;supervillain,&#8221; successfully misled approximately 130,000 investors through a complex network of investment vehicles and offices across China.</p>
<p>The trial revealed the extensive network of &#8220;intermediaries and professionals&#8221; that facilitated the laundering of Bitcoin, allowing the acquisition of assets across the UK, Europe, and Dubai. London’s Metropolitan Police Service hailed the verdict as a significant disruption to a &#8220;sophisticated economic crime operation,&#8221; emphasizing the role of cryptocurrencies in <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-under-fire-latest-exchange-charged-scandal/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">modern financial crimes</a>.</p>

<p>Speaking of Bitcoin, the asset has exhibited a downward trend, with its value decreasing by nearly 1% on the last day alone. Currently, its price is just over $63,000 as market participants await key policy decisions from the US Federal Reserve.</p>

<title>No Apologies: 3AC Co-Founder ‘Not Sorry’ For Crypto Hedge Fund Bankruptcy</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/no-apologies-3ac-co-founder-not-sorry-for-crypto-hedge-fund-bankruptcy/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/no-apologies-3ac-co-founder-not-sorry-for-crypto-hedge-fund-bankruptcy/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的<br />Kyle Davies, 3AC的共同创始人之一，在Unchained Podcast中讨论了加密社区对他的看法，解释了为什么他不后悔两年前这家加密对冲基金的破产，以及他的监禁。他在新加坡逃避四个月的监禁，坚称不打算立即返回。他对公司破产不感到抱歉，认为解决问题的关键是如何建设未来。他和另一位创始人苏朱可能成为面对类似问题的公司的顾问。 <div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Kyle Davies, the co-founder of the now-bankrupt Three Arrows Capital (3AC), recently joined the Unchained Podcast to discuss the crypto community’s opinion of him, why he isn’t sorry that the crypto hedge fund went bankrupt two years ago, and his prison sentence.</p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Where On Earth Is Kyle Davies?</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022, 3AC was one of the giants in the industry. The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/inside-the-three-arrows-capital-3ac-collapse/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">now-failed</a> crypto hedge fund saw its collapse shortly after Terra’s crash, which sent the whole crypto market into turmoil.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, Kyle Davies and Su Zhu, 3AC’s founders, have faced legal repercussions and massive public scrutiny. Both founders were sentenced to four months of imprisonment after failing to cooperate with authorities in the 3AC’s bankruptcy investigation.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">After Zhu’s apprehension, Davies refused to turn himself in to Singaporean authorities, and he remained at large. In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEsjWV7GRgY&amp;t=240s" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">interview</a> with Laura Shin for the Unchained Podcast, the co-founder shed some light on his decision to avoid the four-month sentence.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">According to Davies, Su Zhu’s <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/three-arrows-capital-founder-4-month-jail-sentence/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">detention</a> took both by surprise as allegedly neither of them knew about the missed court date that led to their sentencing. Their lawyer is seemingly at fault for not informing them of the court date.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, Zhu’s experience in prison was not what Davies expected it to be, as he took the time to “meditate and help others.” Despite not being like “in the movies,” the fugitive co-founder doesn’t plan to return to Singapore soon unless authorities “remove the contempt.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">However, Davies is hopeful that a settlement can be reached with Singapore authorities:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I’m not going to go back immediately. But obviously, these things just resolve at some point. There are settlements. These are common kinds of tactics. So, I’ve learned where people try to pressure for this or pressure that settlement or whatever. But at the end of the day, all these things resolve.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The 3AC’s co-founder also believes that his entrance to the US shouldn’t be a problem despite his resigning from his American citizenship. Nevertheless, Davies didn’t disclose his current location beyond affirming that he was somewhere in Europe. He considers that giving his exact location “would be problematic.”</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">No Apologies For The Crypto Community</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">During the interview, Shin asked about the crypto community’s opinion regarding Davies’s lack of visible “remorse.” The co-founder addressed his “reputation,” refusing to apologize for the crypto hedge fund’s collapse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Am I sorry for a company going bankrupt? No, like companies go bankrupt, almost every company goes bankrupt, right?</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Davies stated that instead of focusing on the mistakes already made, what matters is “how you build or what you do about it.” He claims that most people who had something negative to say about him or 3AC’s bankruptcy were “largely people who are not affected.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, Zhu and Davies could serve as an example and as advisors for the firms that face similar <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/creditors-rejoice-as-worldcoin-wld-skyrockets-188/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">challenges</a> that 3AC did, according to Davies:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We’re definitely trying our best. We can add value in various ways. At a minimum, we can even tell the next Three Arrows how to do things better when they go bankrupt.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Spot ETFs Hits $150 Billion Trading Volume Milestone Amid Market Mayhem — What’s Next?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。美国现货比特币交易所交易基金（ETF）累计交易量突破1500亿美元，仅不到三个月时间。然而，尽管取得里程碑，市场仍面临挑战，昨日比特币价格下跌，创下纪录的净流出。交易量增加，但市场动态发生变化，市场份额出现挤压现象。流出超过32.62亿美元，比之前纪录高出一倍，暴露市场的波动性。对ETF的流动性进行了批评，指出其只能在美国市场营业时间内交易，导致投资者无法在夜间市场波动时卖出持仓。 <div>
<p>As of the latest data, the US spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) have <a href="https://www.theblock.co/data/crypto-markets/bitcoin-etf/bitcoin-spot-etf-volumes" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">surged</a> past a notable milestone, with cumulative trading volume breaching the $150 billion mark on March 19.</p>
<p>This development is particularly noteworthy considering the spot <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/vanguard-ceo-double-down-on-anti-bitcoin-etf-stance/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">ETFs</a>&#8216; relatively short period in the market, following their approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) less than three months ago.</p>
<p>However, despite this milestone, the market has not been without its challenges. Record net outflows were also observed amid a notable dip in Bitcoin&#8217;s price yesterday.</p>

<h2>Record Trading Volumes And Market Dynamics</h2>
<p>The achievement of surpassing $150 billion in cumulative trading volumes for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/jim-bianco-backs-vanguard-on-bitcoin-etfs-decision/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">US spot BTC ETFs</a> reflects a significant interest and participation in the cryptocurrency market. Notably, a substantial portion of this volume was recorded in a relatively short span, with $50 billion added since March 8 alone.</p>
<p>Additionally, yesterday alone, trading volumes reached $5.6 billion, led by BlackRock&#8217;s IBIT, Grayscale&#8217;s GBTC, and Fidelity&#8217;s FBTC, highlighting the active engagement of investors with these financial instruments.</p>
<img alt="Bitcoin Spot ETF Volume" class="wp-image-288530 size-large" height="276" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-20-at-16.33.39.png?resize=980%2C276" width="980" />
<p>However, this enthusiasm has been tempered by a significant market shift, with Grayscale&#8217;s GBTC experiencing a &#8220;squeeze&#8221; in market share amid daily outflows.</p>
<p>Conversely, BlackRock&#8217;s IBIT has emerged as a primary beneficiary, witnessing a substantial increase in market share from 22.1% as of inception to 45.2%.</p>

<h2>Record Bitcoin Spot ETFs Outflows And Vulnerabilities</h2>
<p>The cryptocurrency market&#8217;s inherent volatility was underscored by the net outflow of $326.2 million from US spot<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/how-are-hong-kong-firms-preparing-for-spot-bitcoin-etfs-osl-exec-shares-details/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> Bitcoin ETFs</a>, which more than doubled the previous record of $158.4 million set earlier in the year.</p>

<p>Amid this development, Peter Schiff has critiqued spot Bitcoin ETFs, highlighting a significant drawback: their liquidity is confined to the operational hours of the US market.</p>

<p>Schiff highlighted that this limitation means that in the event of a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-see-more-pullback-think-quant-explains-why/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">market downturn</a> outside these hours, investors cannot sell their holdings until the US market resumes trading, leaving them in a &#8220;helpless&#8221; position to react to overnight market movements.</p>

So if the market crashes overnight, you have no ability to sell until the U.S. market opens for trading in the morning. Very frustrating to watch helplessly with no ability to get out.</p>

<title>Goldman Sachs Remains Bullish On Bitcoin Despite 18% Price Dip: Key Reasons Why</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/goldman-sachs-remains-bullish-on-bitcoin/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/goldman-sachs-remains-bullish-on-bitcoin/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章提到，零售投资者一直是比特币和加密货币价格上涨的主要推动力，但机构投资者正在逐渐进入市场。高盛的数字资产负责人指出，机构投资者参与将为加密货币市场带来额外的流动性、稳定性和可信度。虽然比特币价格最近有所下降，但机构投资者的参与和加密货币ETF的推出被认为是重要的推动因素。金融机构对区块链技术的潜力也表达了乐观态度，认为这种技术不仅可以应用于加密货币，还可以对其他资产进行交易。 <div>
<p>Retail investors have been the primary driving force in the recent rise of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency prices in general. However, institutional investors are now beginning to enter the market, according to Mathew McDermott, the head of digital assets at <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/goldman-sachs-eyes-participant-role-bitcoin-etfs/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Goldman Sachs</a>. </p>
<h2>Bitcoin Rally Cools Down </h2>
<p>Speaking at the Digital Asset Summit (DAS) conference in London, McDermott <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/goldman-sachs-digital-asset-head-says-crypto-rally-driven-by-retail-investors-2024-03-19/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">noted </a>that while retail investors have been the main drivers of the price action, there is a noticeable shift as institutions increasingly show interest and participation in the cryptocurrency market, reflecting the growing acceptance and recognition of cryptocurrencies as a legitimate asset class.</p>
<p>McDermott highlighted significant changes witnessed this year regarding the types of clients and the trading volumes. The involvement of institutional investors is seen as a significant development for the cryptocurrency market, as it brings additional liquidity, stability, and credibility.</p>

<p>While the exact factors driving Bitcoin&#8217;s recent price gains remain uncertain, the launch of US spot Bitcoin <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bleed-grayscale-ceo/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">exchange-traded funds</a> (ETFs) this year has been identified as a notable catalyst. McDermott described the ETFs as causing a &#8220;psychological shift&#8221; in the market. </p>
<p>However, the rally in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has cooled off somewhat in recent days, with <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-see-more-pullback-think-quant-explains-why/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">BTC plunging</a> more than 18% to $60,900 on Tuesday, coinciding with a broader decline in riskier assets on signs that the Federal Reserve may not cut interest rates as much as previously expected.</p>
<h2>Optimism Amidst Crypto Market Challenges</h2>
<p>The cryptocurrency market experienced a notable boom during 2020 and 2021, fueled by ultra-low interest rates that encouraged speculative investments. However, this period was followed by a sharp downturn in 2022, with several high-profile crypto-related failures and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/tornado-cash-founder-charged-for-allegedly-aiding-1-2-billion-in-laundered-funds/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">bankruptcies</a>, including FTX, resulting in significant losses for investors. </p>
<p>McDermott mentioned that Goldman Sachs has examined bankruptcy claims and explored other investment opportunities in this context.</p>
<p>Regulators have consistently warned about the high risks of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, emphasizing their limited real-world utility. McDermott acknowledged that there is currently some leverage in the system, but he expressed that it is not at the same level of “hyperbole” as in previous years.</p>

<p>In addition to their interest in cryptocurrencies, various banks, including Goldman Sachs, have recognized the potential of blockchain technology that underlies these digital assets. They believe <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/can-solana-exist-without-layer-2s/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">blockchain technology</a> could be applied to trade other assets beyond cryptocurrencies. </p>
<p>Pilot projects exploring tokenizing traditional financial assets, such as bonds, have been initiated. Still, the routine issuance and establishment of a liquid secondary market have yet to be realized.</p>
<p>Ultimately, McDermott expressed optimism about the future, stating that he expects to witness the tokenization of more asset classes and the development of scalable solutions in the next few years. This suggests that adopting and integrating blockchain technology in traditional financial systems may accelerate, providing new opportunities.</p>
<img alt="Bitcoin" class="size-large" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZtZjJcZe/" width="1815" />
<p>Despite the market downturn, as of this writing, bitcoin has climbed back to the $64,000 mark, showing increased volatility in recent days. </p>

<title>Dogecoin Days Are Over: Shiba Inu Team Hints At Major Updates</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-shiba-inu-updates/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-shiba-inu-updates/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />Shiba Inu团队暗示将进行重大更新，可能超越Dogecoin。Lucie透露了Shiba Inu虚拟世界的创新计划，暗示Metaverse的进一步发展。Shib的Metaverse已实现几个里程碑，同时还计划推出TREAT代币作为Metaverse计划的一部分。团队声称Shiba Inu生态系统正经历巨变，可能使其在市场上更加稳固地占据地位。 <div>
<p><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-team-next-big-thing-big-money-shib/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">The Shiba Inu team</a> has dropped hints about significant updates set to take place within the<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-ecosystem-soars-shibarium-hits-crucial-milestone/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> ecosystem</a> that could see it overtake Dogecoin. This announcement comes amid SHIB’s impressive market performance recently, positioning the digital asset as a formidable contender to prominent cryptocurrencies like <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-dogecoin-killer/">Dogecoin</a>. </p>
<h2>Shiba Inu Team Teases Game-Changing Updates</h2>
<p>In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, popular Shiba Inu marketing influencer, Lucie <a href="https://x.com/lucieshib/status/1769275410536169833?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">teased</a> about upcoming plans set to launch in Shiba Inu’s virtual world, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-goes-virtual/">Shib The Metaverse.</a> According to Lucie, the Shib team has put in place innovative plans for the virtual world, potentially aiming to further develop and improve the highly anticipated Metaverse. </p>

<p>Previously speculated to launch by the end of 2023, Shiba Inu’s metaverse remains unreleased, as the Shib team continues to keep the official release date under wraps. Nonetheless, indications of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-to-introduce-four-new-metaverse-hubs-in-2023/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ongoing progress and developments within the metaverse</a> persist, as evident in Lucie’s recent announcement of upcoming updates. </p>
<p>While the team is still working towards a potential launch, the Shib Metaversers has already achieved several milestones, opening land bids via its website and publicizing the Metaverse through its official X account.  </p>
<p>In addition to Lucie’s remarks about the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-lead-game-changing/">upcoming updates</a> for the SHIB Metaverse, the Shiba Inu influencer has disclosed that one of its ecosystem’s soon-to-be-launched tokens, TREAT, would become an integral part of the Metaverse plans. </p>
<p>According to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-investing-meme-coins/">Lucie</a>, SHIB’s solution powered by Zama will run on Treat, providing liquidity to Shiba Inu’s stablecoin, SHI. Additionally, the TREAT token <a href="https://x.com/lucieshib/status/1763338921738477998?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">will serve as a reward</a> to individuals in SHIB The Metaverse. </p>
<h2>SHIB Set To Overtake Dogecoin?</h2>
<p>In a bold statement <a href="https://x.com/shibtoken/status/1770248051254338034?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">released</a> via SHIB’s official X account, the Shiba Inu team has declared the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/forget-dogecoin-shiba-inu-set-to-become-the-top-dog-expert-predicts-100-billion-market-cap/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">demise of Dogecoin’s reign</a> in the cryptocurrency space. According to the team, the Shiba Inu ecosystem is currently brimming with <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-project-timelines-shib-price/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">upcoming projects</a> that could potentially transform the ecosystem and further solidify the cryptocurrency’s position in the market. </p>
<p>While the team has stated that specifics regarding the updates remain undisclosed, they have issued a compelling message to the broader cryptocurrency community: “Get ready for a new top doggo.”</p>

<p>Sharing a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-shibarium-milestone/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">recent milestone</a> achieved by the popular cryptocurrency, the SHIB team declared that “Dogecoin’s days were numbered,” emphasizing SHIB’s <a href="https://x.com/cryptocom/status/1770208635882295414?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ascent</a> to the position of the second-largest meme coin by market capitalization. The cryptocurrency has been <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-lead-dev-shib-bull/">steadily gaining ground</a> against its primary rival, Dogecoin, experiencing substantial price rallies and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-surge-in-interest/">heightened interest</a> from investors and traders. </p>
<p>With more updates potentially set to take effect within the ecosystem, Shiba Inu could see its value <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-dogecoin-shib-excitement/">surpassing Dogecoin’s. </a>However, the optimistic outlook is yet to be confirmed, as SHIB is currently trading at $ 0.000025, and <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/can-doge-avoid-a-dive-sell-pressure-puts-memecoin-to-the-test/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOGE</a> at $0.13, according to CoinMarketCap.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Liquidity Exploding, The “Alameda Gap” Is No More</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-liquidity-exploding-alameda-gap-no-more/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-liquidity-exploding-alameda-gap-no-more/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章指出，比特币在3月19日价格下跌至61500美元，但随着货币恢复，主要加密货币交易所的流动性一直在稳步恢复。现在，比特币市场流动性高于“阿拉米达差距”，这对交易员来说是一大利好。文章解释了流动性对比特币和加密货币交易的重要性，并指出了导致流动性恢复的几个因素，包括比特币价格上涨和主要交易所的交易价差收窄。文章还提到，比特币半减产事件即将发生，预计会进一步提高流动性。 <div>
<p>On March 19, Bitcoin prices fell to as low as $61,500. However, even as fear reigned, Kaiko, a blockchain analytics platform, <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/KaikoData/status/1770393602910527792" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">observed</a> that the coin&#8217;s liquidity across major crypto exchanges, including Binance and Coinbase, has been recovering steadily. </p>
<p>When writing, the Bitcoin market liquidity is above the &#8220;Alameda Gap,&#8221; a massive boost for traders, including those looking to double down ahead of Bitcoin halving. </p>
<h2>Bitcoin Liquidity Jumps Above The &#8220;Alameda Gap&#8221;</h2>
<p>Liquidity is crucial in Bitcoin and crypto trading in general. It simply refers to how easy it is to convert fiat to crypto or crypto to fiat without impacting price. The higher the liquidity, the easier to trade and receive assets at a fair price.</p>

<p>Over the past two years, since the collapse of FTX, the popular crypto exchange, and its investment arm, Alameda Research, there has been a notable liquidity drop across the crypto trading scene, especially in Bitcoin. The observation, dubbed the &#8220;Alameda Gap,&#8221; negatively impacted liquidity and, by extension, market stability.</p>
<img alt="BTC liquidity improving | Source: Kaiko" class="size-full wp-image-288513" height="597" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GJGzmVFasAAmRbI.png?resize=1024%2C597" width="1024" />
<p>Fortunately, recent data from Kaiko paints a much brighter picture. In their latest report, the Bitcoin 2% market depth, a key liquidity indicator that measures the depth of the market by showing the volume of buy and sell orders within 2% of the current price, has fully recovered. Most importantly, it is now at the pre-FTX average of $470 million, pointing to renewed confidence in the Bitcoin secondary market.</p>
<h2>Rising Prices, Tight Spread Drivers Of Liquidity</h2>
<p>In their analysis, Kaiko pointed the refreshing bounce to multiple factors. At the top of the list, the analytics platform said the recent surge in Bitcoin prices has played a crucial role. Bitcoin is currently trading above $64,000 when writing. </p>
<p>However, in March, prices soared to as high as $73,800. The spike follows the approval of several spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January. </p>

<p>Moreover, Kaiko added that tight Bitcoin trading spreads on major exchanges like <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/paradigm-industry-titans-rallying-behind-coinbase/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Coinbase</a>, Kraken, and Bitstamp deepened the overall market liquidity. Usually, the higher the liquidity, the tighter the bid-ask spread becomes. This development suggests that more people keep trading and engaging with the market.</p>
<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/x/oAbcSmXX/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Bitcoin price trending downward on the daily chart | Source: BTCUSDT on Binance, TradingView" class="size-full" height="904" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/oAbcSmXX/" width="1787" /></a>
<p>It is yet to be seen whether Bitcoin&#8217;s liquidity will increase ahead of the highly anticipated halving. The event, set for mid-April, halves miner rewards but will make the coin scarcer. Rising prices, expected after halving, will likely draw more people, further deepening liquidity.</p>

<title>Shiba Inu’s Shibarium Sees Staggering 99% Decline In Transactions, What’s Happening?</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shibarium-99-decline/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shibarium-99-decline/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。<br />比特币市场崩溃导致加密市场下跌，同时以太坊Layer 2网络Shibarium也受到重创。每日交易次数下降至不到1万笔，降至数月来的最低水平。Shiba Inu价格下跌也是一个原因，导致投资者等待价格回升。竞争激烈，如Solana与以太坊竞争最活跃用户。 <div>
<p class="p2">In addition to the Bitcoin crash that has brought down the crypto market, Shibarium, an Ethereum Layer 2 network developed by the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-surge-in-interest/">Shiba Inu team</a>, has taken a huge hit. This latest drawback comes in the form of a significant decline in the number of daily transactions being carried out on the network, leading to its lowest level in months.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Shibarium Daily Transactions Fall Below 10,000</h2>
<p class="p2">From the end of 2023 and into the new year of 2024, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shibarium-breaks-the-internet-again-with-over-400-million-layer-2-transactions/">Shibarium network</a> had been seeing a lot of adoption. This was embodied by a significant rise in the number of daily transactions that were being carried out on the network. It rose rapidly and crossed more than 7 million daily transactions in December 2023. And even after usage began to wane in the new year, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-takes-a-hit-amidst-shibarium-user-exodus/">Ethereum Layer 2 network</a> was still able to maintain an average of around 1 million transactions per day.</p>

<p class="p2">However, the network has entered into what seems to be an incredibly trying period with a notable crash in the number of daily transactions. This <a href="https://www.shibariumscan.io/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">decline</a> began on March 10 when the daily transaction figures fell below 1 million to 800,000 for the first time this year.</p>
<p class="p2">In the following days, the transaction count would pick up and cross 1 million again. But this was only short-lived as a bigger crash was on the horizon. March 16 was the last the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shibarium-breaks-the-internet-again-with-over-400-million-layer-2-transactions/">Shibarium network</a> saw daily transactions come in above 1 million as the count would crash to less than 600,000 the next day.</p>
<p class="p2">This decline would continue for the next few days and by Wednesday, March 30, the total daily transaction count on the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shibarium-new-project-dao-charter/">Shibarium network</a> was sitting at 9,330. The last time the daily transaction count on the network was this low was back in November 2023, which means that the transaction count has now fallen to its lowest level in four months.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Shiba Inu Price Decline To Blame?</h2>
<p class="p2">The decline in the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-price-down-today/">Shiba Inu price</a> over the last few days can be attributed to the Bitcoin crash, which saw the price go from $73,000 to below $61,000 in a matter of days. As a result, altcoins such as Shiba Inu have been suffering as well.</p>

<p class="p2">This <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-price-down-today/">crash in price</a> has seen investors reeling, with many not willing to gamble with their coins as they wait for prices to recover. This could explain the drastic drop in daily transactions on the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shibarium-new-record/">Shibarium network</a> as crypto users enter a period of waiting for what will happen next.</p>
<p class="p2">If this is the case, then a recovery in the price should trigger another wave of adoption for the layer 2 network. However, competition is also fierce as the likes of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-defi-tvl-rockets-80-impact-on-sol-price/">Solana</a> is taking on <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-price-reach-14000/">Ethereum</a> for the blockchain with the most active users.</p>

<title>Grayscale Outflows And Weak US Demand Result In Back-To-Back Negative Bitcoin ETF Flows</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/back-to-back-negative-bitcoin-etf-flows/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/back-to-back-negative-bitcoin-etf-flows/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是负面的。<br />比特币近期达到了历史最高价，但随后出现了显著回落，主要原因是Grayscale的Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC)的卖出行为增加以及美国证券交易委员会 (SEC)于1月10日对新投资工具的需求下降。最近两天，比特币ETF的资金流动为负，主要是由于美国市场的大规模赎回和对新ETF的需求减少。对于拥有比特币ETF的流动性可能存在挑战，因为当夜间市场崩溃时，投资者无法及时出售，无法买入。持有实际比特币的投资者可以更加灵活地进行交易。 <div>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC) recently achieved a significant milestone by reaching an all-time high (ATH) of $73,700 on March 14th. This surge was primarily attributed to the booming Bitcoin ETF market, which substantially impacted the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price. </p>
<p>However, following this new ATH, BTC has experienced a significant <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-slide-top-trader-provides-expert-analysis/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">price correction</a>, hitting a low of $60,900 on Tuesday, March 19th. The main factors contributing to this downturn are the increased selling activity of Grayscale&#8217;s Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) and a decline in demand for the new investment vehicles <a href="http://BREAKING: Spot Bitcoin ETFs Approved By US SEC" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">approved</a> by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on January 10th.</p>
<h2>Days Of Negative Bitcoin ETF Flows</h2>
<p>James Butterfill, the head of research at CoinShares, shed light on the situation, <a href="https://x.com/jbutterfill/status/1770354905443709018?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">stating </a>that net Bitcoin ETF flows have been negative for two consecutive days. This negative trend results from heightened outflows from <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etf-fee-war-grayscale-ceo-says-gbtc-fees-will-drop-over-time/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Grayscale </a>and reduced demand for new ETFs in the United States, Butterfill remarked. </p>
<p>On March 19 alone, there was a <a href="https://x.com/WuBlockchain/status/1770311728636817816?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">net outflow</a> of $326 million from Bitcoin spot ETFs, with the outflows continuing for two days. Grayscale&#8217;s GBTC witnessed a single-day net outflow of $443 million. </p>

<img alt="Bitcoin ETF" class="wp-image-288501 size-large" height="439" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GJFo8SdaIAASpFm.png?w=559&#038;resize=559%2C439" width="559" />
<p>The only Bitcoin ETF to see net inflows on the day was BlackRock&#8217;s IBIT ETF, with a modest single-day <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-lawsuit-ripple-sec-agreement-schedule/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">net inflow</a> of $75.23 million. </p>
<p>It is worth noting that despite the lack of demand and record outflows in recent days, the total assets under management of the ten Bitcoin ETF issuers remain at a whopping $53.5 billion. </p>
<h2>The Liquidity Challenge</h2>
<p>Economist and global strategist <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/peter-schiff-questions-microstrategys-bitcoin-buys/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Peter Schiff</a> has raised concerns regarding the limited liquidity of Bitcoin held in an ETF. In a recent social media <a href="https://x.com/PeterSchiff/status/1770227134985895971?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, Schiff highlighted that owning Bitcoin through an ETF restricts liquidity to US market hours. </p>
<p>This means that if a market crash occurs overnight, investors cannot sell until the US market opens in the morning. Schiff expressed frustration at the inability to take action when needed.</p>
<p>A user responded to Schiff&#8217;s statement, interpreting it as an indication that holding Bitcoin ETFs would leave investors on the sidelines during a market crash, missing out on the opportunity to buy the dip. </p>
<p>The user argued that those holding the actual Bitcoin can take advantage of such situations while ETF investors are disadvantaged. Schiff concurred with the user&#8217;s perspective, emphasizing that owning Bitcoin directly provides better options than relying on a third party to store it and facing <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-boom-in-argentina-why-more-people-are-choosing-crypto-over-dollars/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">limited liquidity</a>.</p>

<p>Schiff&#8217;s preference for owning Bitcoin aligns with the principle of self-custody and control over one&#8217;s assets. By holding the actual cryptocurrency, investors can execute transactions at any time, regardless of market hours or the involvement of intermediaries.</p>
<img alt="Bitcoin ETF" class="size-large" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/wZoGihW1/" width="1815" />
<p>Currently, the price of BTC stands at $63,800, reflecting a 3% increase over the past 24 hours. The forthcoming price movements of the dominant cryptocurrency and its correlation with the ETF market, which has emerged as a significant factor impacting BTC&#8217;s price volatility, are eagerly anticipated. It remains to be seen how these factors will shape the future trajectory of the cryptocurrency market.</p>

<title>Greenpeace Claims To Expose The Bitcoin ‘Puppet Masters’</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/greenpeace-bitcoin-puppet-masters/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/greenpeace-bitcoin-puppet-masters/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是正面的。Greenpeace USA揭示了比特币挖矿行业与各种“气候否认者”之间密切联系的新丑闻，包括保守派智囊团、化石燃料游说者和气候变化怀疑论者之间的联系。然后，Bitcoin社区对此作出了强烈反应，挑战了报告的结论，并提出了更复杂的行业环境和可持续努力的对抗观点。最后，Bitcoin社区还通过o（Satoshi Action Fund）展示了对比特币倡导的效果和侵略性，突显了其在美国的积极作用。 <div>
<p>Greenpeace USA has unveiled a new shady <a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/reports/mining-for-power/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">report</a> alleging close ties between the Bitcoin mining industry and various “climate denialists.” Released on March 19, 2024, the report alleges deep-seated connections between the BTC mining industry and various entities traditionally viewed as opposing progressive climate change policies.</p>
<p>These include conservative think tanks, fossil fuel lobbyists, and climate change skeptics, casting a shadow on the Bitcoin community&#8217;s claims of moving towards sustainability.</p>
<p>Greenpeace&#8217;s investigation purports to reveal a web of relationships suggesting that, despite public claims of embracing renewable energy and reducing carbon footprints, the mining industry remains entangled with groups and individuals who have historically resisted efforts to combat climate change.</p>
<p>A particularly provocative claim is the purported alignment with networks funded by the conservative Koch brothers and the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), known for their anti-environmental stances and policies deemed anti-democratic.</p>
<p>The report goes further to accuse the Bitcoin mining sector of fostering a &#8220;revolving door&#8221; phenomenon with the government, especially figures from the former <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/trump-bitcoin-u-turn/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Trump administration</a>, implying an intricate dance of influence and policy manipulation that benefits the mining industry at the expense of environmental progress.</p>

<p>Erik Kojola, a senior researcher at Greenpeace USA, encapsulates the concern, asserting, &#8220;Our research uncovered deeper and more extensive connections between proponents of BTC mining and climate deniers than anticipated. The Bitcoin industry is akin to a house of cards that could topple at any time and people are working hard behind the scenes to ensure its longevity through greenwashing and deceit all at the expense of communities and the climate.”</p>
<p>Johanna Fornberg, Greenpeace USA Researcher added that the: “Bitcoin industry groups are caught up in a web that includes some of the most notorious climate denialists. [&#8230;] Revealing who has power and influence in this industry is essential for holding them accountable for unsubstantiated claims, climate impacts, and harm to local communities.”</p>
<p>Along with the report, Greenpeace USA created an interactive power map that shows the relationships between BTC industry groups, conservative and corporate interest groups, politicians, and other stakeholders highlighted in the report.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Community Reacts</h2>
<p>The release of Greenpeace&#8217;s Mining for Power report has sparked a robust response from the Bitcoin community, challenging the assertions made and offering a counter-perspective that paints a more complex picture of the industry&#8217;s environmental footprint and sustainability efforts.</p>
<p>Daniel Batten, a managing partner at CH4 Capital and an authoritative figure in the environmental analysis of BTC mining, leads the charge in disputing the report&#8217;s findings. Batten <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/greenpeace-bitcoin-lie-destroyed-brutal-post/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">criticizes Greenpeace</a> for relying on &#8220;a very old dataset,&#8221; which he argues no longer accurately represents the current state of BTC mining.</p>
<p>According to Batten, a significant portion of the Bitcoin network now relies on <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-mining-potential-top-science-journal/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">sustainable energy sources</a>, a claim backed by recent reports, including a Bloomberg Intelligence analysis from September 2023, which found that Bitcoin has achieved a 52.6% rate of sustainable energy use.</p>

<p>Batten robustly contests the claims about Bitcoin&#8217;s carbon footprint, water usage, and alleged strain on electrical grids, citing peer-reviewed research and expert analysis that contradicts Greenpeace&#8217;s conclusions. For instance, he references research indicating that mining contributes to grid stability, can lower electricity costs, and may accelerate the transition to renewable energy sources, thereby presenting a narrative of mining as potentially beneficial, rather than detrimental, to environmental sustainability efforts.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The only thing breaking is GreenpeaceUSA’s credibility. </p>
<p>One of the features of GreenpeaceUSA reports is that they are very easy to debunk. You rarely make it past the first paragraph without reading a large swathe of misinformation. This latest report is no exception. </p>
<p>1. “The… <a href="https://t.co/ekgUnpuriV" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://t.co/ekgUnpuriV</a></p>

<p></p>
<p>Echoing Batten&#8217;s sentiment, the Satoshi Action Fund (SAF), identified by Greenpeace as a prominent advocate for Bitcoin, has utilized the report&#8217;s publication as an opportunity to underscore its effectiveness and aggressiveness in promoting Bitcoin advocacy in the USA. Dennis Porter, the founder of SAF, stated via X, &#8220;HUGE NEWS: GreenPeace highlights Satoshi Act Fund as the most effective and aggressive Bitcoin advocacy group in the USA.&#8221;</p>

<p></p>
<p>Moreover, the Bitcoin community has been further bolstered by a community note from X , which flags Greenpeace&#8217;s article for containing outdated information and inaccuracies, especially regarding the energy sources for Bitcoin mining. It states, &#8220;The article contains many factual errors, like the flawed per transaction accounting of energy, and outdated and inaccurate information, such as the proportion of fossil fuels used as energy source. Nowadays the majority of the energy used by Bitcoin mining is renewable.”</p>
<p>At press time, BTC traded at $64,220.</p>

<title>FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried Buckles Ahead Of Sentencing, 50 Years Too Much?</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-50-years/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-50-years/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。<br />谈论前FTX首席执行官Sam Bankman-Fried即将在3月28日被判刑。他的律师最近表示，他不应该被判50年监禁。律师们表示，FTX客户并没有遭受损失，因为他们收到了破产加密交易所欠他们的钱。他们反驳了检察官的指控，称没有依据表明Bankman-Fried会再犯。他们担心他可能在监狱内丧命，并主张他应该被判5到6年监禁。检方声称他们希望公正对待被告，但律师们认为对Bankman-Fried这样的处罚过于严厉。 <div>
<p>Talks about <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-collapse-sam-bankman-fried-trial/">Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF)</a>, the former CEO of the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/major-reveals-from-the-ftx-bankruptcy-filing-whats-the-takeaway/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">defunct crypto exchange FTX</a>, have <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-prison-2/#:~:text=A%20recent%20court%20filing%20revealed,100%20years%20locked%20behind%20bars.">picked up steam</a> ahead of his sentencing on March 28. The primary discussion has been the number of years the defendant could get, with his lawyers recently arguing that the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftxs-sam-bankman-fried-should-receive-50-year-jail/">prosecution’s proposed sentence</a> of 50 years is unfair. </p>
<h2>Sam Bankman-Fried Getting 50 Years Is “Not Justice”</h2>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/66631291/413/united-states-v-bankman-fried/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">letter</a> addressed to Judge Lewis Kaplan, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-fraud/">Bankman-Fried’s lawyers</a> criticized the government’s memorandum, in which they proposed that SBF be sentenced to 40 to 50 years. They further mentioned that the prosecution is adopting a “medieval view of punishment to reach what amounts to a death-in-prison sentencing recommendation.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, his lawyers used the letter to rebut the prosecution’s arguments that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sam-bankman-fried-cites-autism-disorder/">Bankman-Fried</a> deserved 50 years in prison. Firstly, they stated that FTX customers didn’t suffer any loss since it had <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-repayment-plan-bitcoin-valued-at-16000/">already been decided</a> that they would receive the money the bankrupt crypto exchange owed them. </p>
<p>The lawyers argue that this wouldn’t have been possible if Sam Bankman-Fried had indeed stolen FTX’s assets, as the prosecution claimed. They also noted that the FTX founder had always acted in good faith, considering his efforts to ensure that FTX could process withdrawals before eventually <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/major-reveals-from-the-ftx-bankruptcy-filing-whats-the-takeaway/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">filing for bankruptcy</a>.</p>
<p>Bankman-Fried’s lawyers also countered the prosecution&#8217;s argument of Recidivism, claiming there was no basis for such belief. They added that offenders with no criminal history, like the defendant, are the least likely to re-offend. Moreover, offenders with a college education are less likely to recidivate. </p>
<p>In their <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-prison-2/#:~:text=A%20recent%20court%20filing%20revealed,100%20years%20locked%20behind%20bars.">sentencing submission</a>, the prosecution had likened Sam Bankman-Fried to other defendants like Bernie Madoff. However, his lawyers argued that this comparison was “way off base” since most cases they alluded to involved frauds that lasted up to a decade, unlike their <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/ftx/sam-bankman-fried-100m-political-favors/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">client’s fraudulent practice</a>, which didn’t last up to that. </p>
<h2>Bankman-Fried Could Die In Prison</h2>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-court/#:~:text=Sam%20Bankman%2DFried%20Chooses%20To%20Stick%20With%20New%20Lawyers&amp;text=Marc%20Mukasey%20and%20Torrey%20Young,team%20led%20by%20Mark%20Cohen.">Sam Bankman-Fried’s lawyers</a> raised the possibility of their client dying in prison due to his “<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sam-bankman-fried-cites-autism-disorder/">condition and vulnerabilities</a>.” Besides SBF’s condition, they mentioned that they are yet to identify a federal defendant convicted of a non-violent offense who served up to 40 to 50 years in prison and was eventually released. </p>

<p>They remarked this was perhaps due to inmates suffering a “two-year decline in life expectancy for each year of imprisonment.” Therefore, they believe this isn’t the way to go about SBF’s sentencing if the government wants to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-prison-2/#:~:text=A%20recent%20court%20filing%20revealed,100%20years%20locked%20behind%20bars.">achieve deterrence</a> and not completely ostracize the defendant. </p>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-defense/">The FTX founder’s lawyers</a> argue that “crushing Sam in this way is unnecessary,” especially considering that he has “lost everything and almost everyone.” Bankman-Fried’s lawyers had, in their sentencing submission, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-fraud/#:~:text=Bankman%2DFried&#039;s%20Lawyers%20Propose%20A,six%20and%20a%20half%20years).">proposed</a> that their client be sentenced to between five and six years. </p>
<p>They urged the government to consider this sentencing limit if they genuinely believed the defendant deserved to “return to liberty.”</p>

<title>Ethereum Foundation Receives Confidential Inquiry From Mysterious State Authority</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-foundation-receives-confidential-inquiry/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-foundation-receives-confidential-inquiry/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是负面的。以太坊基金会接受了未透露的“政府机构”的调查，已删除其拘留证据。说明可能面临的法律行动引起以太坊社区内的猜测和不确定性。据称，此调查可能与ETF拒绝有关。ETF的延迟和SEC与ETF发行人之间的缺乏沟通引发了进一步的推测。以太坊价格的弱点可能受到内部人员预期SEC的审查的影响。尽管存在不确定性，ETH已成功恢复，并在过去24小时中涨幅4%。 <div>
<p>The Ethereum Foundation (EF) has come under investigation by an undisclosed &#8220;state authority,&#8221;. As per a <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-foundation-website/commit/769b30603504b4b5e8f601f8014691a8d1821390" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">commit message</a> on GitHub, the EF received a &#8220;voluntary inquiry&#8221; from the authority, accompanied by a confidentiality requirement. </p>
<p>The details and scope of the investigation remain undisclosed, leading to speculation and uncertainty within the Ethereum community. However, this is the first time in the Ethereum Foundation&#8217;s history that it has faced such legal action. </p>
<h2>Ethereum Foundation Removes Warrant Canary</h2>
<p>In a significant development, the Ethereum Foundation has removed its Warrant Canary from its website, indicating that it has been subpoenaed by a government agency in the US, <a href="https://x.com/Husslin_/status/1770470520263209074?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">according </a>to former investment banker Husslin Narwal. </p>

<p>For further context, a warrant canary is a method used by organizations to communicate to the public that they have not received any secret subpoenas or government requests for user data or surveillance. It is a way for organizations to signal their compliance with legal requests without directly disclosing sensitive information. </p>
<img alt="Ethereum Foundation" class="size-large wp-image-288542" height="380" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GJH5eT5XYAAF4EB.jpeg?w=980&#038;resize=980%2C380" width="980" />
<p>Narwal further suggested that the inclusion of a confidentiality requirement suggests a gag order, restricting or prohibiting certain individuals or entities from speaking or disclosing certain information to the public or other parties, limiting the Foundation&#8217;s ability to disclose information about the investigation.</p>
<p>Moreover, Narwal highlighted several key points, including the foundation&#8217;s compliance with the authorities and willingness to provide private data. The delay in <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/fidelity-adjusts-ethereum-etf-application/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ethereum Exchange-Traded Funds</a> (ETFs) and the alleged lack of communication between the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and ETF issuers have led to speculation that the investigation may be linked to the ETF rejection. </p>
<h2>Speculation Mounts </h2>
<p>Narwal also mentioned the recent &#8220;weakness&#8221; in Ethereum&#8217;s price, possibly influenced by alleged insiders anticipating a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-watchdog-sues-sec-over-eth-gate/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">negative outcome</a> from the SEC. He suggested that the SEC may find evidence that casts doubt on Ethereum&#8217;s decentralization, such as a concentration of token ownership. </p>
<p>Additionally, Narwal mentioned previous <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-insider-china-eth-jeopardize-crypto/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">reports </a>suggesting significant Chinese ownership of ETH or the investigation related to fraud or tax matters. Narwal concluded his analysis by stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>Without any more info from the Foundation or any state authorities, traders will probably assume the worst and derisk </p></blockquote>

<p>Overall, the Ethereum Foundation&#8217;s investigation by an unnamed state authority has created uncertainty and speculation within the Ethereum community. The removal of the Warrant Canary and the confidentiality requirement have limited the foundation&#8217;s ability to provide details about the investigation. </p>
<p>As the situation unfolds, market participants eagerly await more information to gain clarity on the investigation&#8217;s scope and its potential <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-data-reveals-big-surge-edging-bitcoin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">impact </a>on the Ethereum ecosystem.</p>
<img alt="Ethereum Foundation " class="size-large" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/T9fNIHPx/" width="1815" />
<p>Despite the growing speculation surrounding the Ethereum Foundation, ETH has managed to recover the $3,289, coupled with a 4% gain in the last 24 hours. </p>

<title>Bitcoin Could See “More Pullback Than We Think,” Quant Explains Why</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-see-more-pullback-think-quant-explains-why/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-see-more-pullback-think-quant-explains-why/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。<br />一位量化分析师解释说，如果过去Open Interest的模式重复，比特币可能会出现持续的回撤。比特币的Open Interest最近显示出类似于2021年11月的轨迹。当Open Interest下降时，投资者可能会关闭头寸，导致价格波动。比特币的Open Interest最近出现下降趋势，与价格暴跌同时发生。最近的高峰类似于2021年11月的高点，当时比特币价格出现暴跌。未来市场发展和Open Interest轨迹是否与先前情况类似还有待观察。目前比特币价格回升至64000美元以上。 <div>
<p>A quant has explained that Bitcoin could end up seeing an extended drawdown if the past pattern in the Open Interest ends up repeating.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Open Interest Has Shown Similar Trajectory To November 2021 Recently</h2>
<p>In a CryptoQuant Quicktake <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/65fa88c3c7f2a01d8c7e3f9d-BTCs-open-interest-is-peaking-out-along-with-the-price-down" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, an analyst talked about the recent trend in the Bitcoin Open Interest. The &#8220;<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-open-interest-alarming-levels-brace-impact/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Open Interest</a>&#8221; is a metric that measures the total amount of BTC derivative contracts (in USD) that are currently open on all exchanges.</p>
<p>When the value of this indictor rises, it means that users are opening up more derivative positions right now. Generally, the total leverage present in the sector increases when the Open Interest rises, so the price may become more likely to show some volatility following this trend.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a decline in the metric suggests some of the investors are either closing up their positions of their own volition or getting forcibly liquidated by their platform.</p>
<p>Usually, sharp decreases in the indicator accompany violent price action, but once the drawdown has finished, the cryptocurrency may become calmer due to a clear out of leverage.</p>
<p>Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Open Interest over the past few years:</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Open Interest" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="641" src="https://i0.wp.com/img.cryptoquant.com/3834/quicktake/6ipYv_eb09a51fd8d64743b953f641c51ac4fd753893e4119fa56adacf9159a941a22b.png?resize=1280%2C641&#038;ssl=1" width="1280" /></p>

<p>As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Open Interest had shot up to some extremely high levels as the recent rally in the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price had occurred.</p>
<p>This trend wasn&#8217;t particularly surprising, as rallies tend to drive speculation. The scale, of the surge, though, was quite extraordinary when compared to past pattern.</p>
<p>&#8220;Open interest can be a powerful rally driver, but it can also be a clear indicator of overheating,&#8221; says the quant. &#8220;In that sense, open interest was a strong driver of BTC&#8217;s price in &#8217;23 and &#8217;24, which helped push the price to new all-time highs in &#8216;24.1Q.&#8221;</p>
<p>From the chart, it&#8217;s visible that the indicator has reversed its direction recently and has been falling down. This drawdown in the metric has come as the asset&#8217;s price has also crashed, causing a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/539-crypto-longs-flushed-bitcoin-plummets-63300/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">high amount of liquidations</a>.</p>
<p>As the analyst has highlighted in the chart, the recent highs in the Bitcoin Open Interest were similar to those observed during the November 2021 price all-time high.</p>
<p>Back then, once the Open Interest had started sliding off as the price had plunged, the asset entered into a state of freefall, which eventually led to the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/why-the-2022-crypto-bear-market-is-different/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">2022 bear market</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;If the pattern of &#8216;21.4Q repeats, we could see more pullback than we think,&#8221; suggests the quant. It now remains to be seen how the market develops from here and if the trajectory of the Open Interest would go similarly to this previous instance or not.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>Bitcoin had slipped all the way to a low of $60,700 during the past day, but the coin has witnessed a rebound since then, as it&#8217;s now back above $64,000.</p>

<title>Plugging The Bitcoin Bleed: Grayscale CEO Confirms Fees Will Reduce As Outflows Cross $12 Billion</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bleed-grayscale-ceo/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。美国数字资产管理公司Grayscale近期出现了一系列资金流出情况。为了减轻这一问题，公司承诺将很快降低ETF费用。Grayscale首席执行官Michael Sonnenshein透露，该公司的比特币ETF（GBTC）费用将逐渐降低。然而，自美国证券交易委员会（SEC）批准后开始交易以来，Grayscale未能录得显著的净流入。公司决定降低费用，希望能够吸引更广泛的投资者，同时满足现有股东的需求。 <div>
<p>American digital asset management company, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-funds-lose-500m-as-grayscales-outflow-wanes/">Grayscale</a> has been experiencing a series of outflows in its <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/grayscale-bitcoin-etf-579-million/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF)</a> in recent times. As a result, the company has attempted to potentially curb the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/grayscale-bitcoin-etf-2-7-billion-exodus-jpmorgan/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">massive exodus</a>, promising to lower ETF fees soon.  </p>
<h2>Grayscale To Reduce Bitcoin ETF Fees</h2>
<p>In a recent interview, Grayscale’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Michael Sonnenshein, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2024/03/19/grayscale-ceo-says-gbtc-bitcoin-etf-fees-will-come-down-over-time.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">disclosed</a> to CNBC that the fees for the company’s Spot Bitcoin ETF (GBTC) will decrease over time. </p>

<p>Since the start of trading, after the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/breaking-news-ticker/breaking-sec-approves-all-11-spot-bitcoin-etfs-btc-price-holds-steady-at-46000/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">approved Spot Bitcoin ETFs</a>, Grayscale has failed to record a significant daily net inflow. However, the asset management firm has steadily <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/grayscale-bitcoin-etf-outflows-end-experts/">experienced outflows worth billions of dollars.</a> </p>
<p>“Of course, we anticipated having outflows. Investors have been wanting to either take gains on their portfolio, or arbitragers coming out of the fund, or people unwinding positions that were part of bankruptcies through forced liquidation,” Sonnenshein stated. </p>
<p>The company’s decision to lower fees marks a shift from its earlier position, where it justified charging investors a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etf-grayscale-spin-off-vaneck-slashes-fees/">higher-than-average fee compared to other Spot Bitcoin ETFs</a> in the market. Presently, Grayscale’s GBTC maintains the highest ETF fee by a wide margin, charging investors approximately 1.5% in fees. </p>
<p>Grayscale’s ETF fee stands in stark contrast to the fees maintained by other leading asset management companies, such as <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-slashes-bitcoin-etf-fees-to-competition/">BlackRock</a>, and Bitwise, which charge 0.25% and 0.21%, respectively. Impressively, these companies, particularly BlackRock, have been <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/spot-bitcoin-etf-hits-milestone-blackrock-influence-evident-in-1-billion-triumph/">seeing a considerable amount of inflows in its ETF</a>, making headlines as they experience a surge in investor demand.</p>
<p>Despite previously advocating the firm’s <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/grayscale-amendments-to-gbtc-trust-agreement/">exorbitant ETF fees</a>, Sonnenshein appears to have acknowledged market sentiment, announcing a reduction in its Spot Bitcoin ETF fees as the market continues to grow and mature. </p>
<h2>GBTC Witnesses Massive Outflows</h2>
<p>Grayscale’s sudden change of heart on retaining its lofty ETF fee may be attributed to the recent surge in outflows from its <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etfs-record-2-2-billion-inflow-in-past-week/">Spot Bitcoin ETF</a>. The asset management company has been witnessing a steady sell-off, totalling $12 billion in outflows since it began trading on January 11. </p>

<p>On Monday, March 18, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/record-breaking-gbtc-outflows-send-bitcoin-down-14-to-62000/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Grayscale recorded its largest outflow</a> in a single day. The asset management company <a href="https://x.com/cazenove_uk/status/1770051786184761509?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">witnessed</a> a staggering $642 million in withdrawals. </p>
<p>These massive outflows have been largely driven by the firm’s high fees, pushing investors and traders to gravitate towards companies offering <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-undercut-lower-spot-bitcoin-etf-fees/">Spot Bitcoin ETFs with less expensive fees. </a></p>
<p>With lower fees, Grayscale stands to attract a wider pool of investors, while also catering to the needs of its existing shareholders. The combination of the firm’s robust reputation, impressive track record and a reduced ETF fee holds the promise of mitigating current outflows and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/grayscale-urges-sec-options-trading-on-bitcoin-etfs/">potentially sparking renewed inflows. </a></p>

<title>Tornado Cash Founder Charged For Allegedly Aiding $1.2 Billion In Laundered Funds</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/tornado-cash-founder-charged-for-allegedly-aiding-1-2-billion-in-laundered-funds/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/tornado-cash-founder-charged-for-allegedly-aiding-1-2-billion-in-laundered-funds/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。在荷兰举行的审判将于3月26日开始，Tornado Cash背后的主要开发者Alexey Pertsev面临洗钱指控。指控称Pertsev在洗钱活动中有重复行为。辩护律师认为起诉书缺乏具体指控。起诉书指称Pertsev是"风暴现金"的共犯，帮助洗钱。审查发现36笔交易指向Tornado Cash，包括大量来自罗宁桥的以太币，与朝鲜网络组织拉萨勒斯有关。审判结果对加密货币社区具有重要意义，可能对开发人员产生冷冻效果。支持者包括Coinbase等表示软件开发不能等同于洗钱或犯罪。审判事件将深入探讨加密货币领域编码、洗钱和法律责任的复杂交集。 <div>
<p>In a trial set to commence on March 26 in the Dutch city of Hertogenbosch, Alexey Pertsev, the prominent developer behind Tornado Cash, finds himself at the center of a legal storm as he faces money laundering charges. The allegations, revealed in a three-page indictment obtained by DL News, accuse Pertsev of<a href="https://www.dlnews.com/articles/people-culture/alexey-pertsev-accused-of-laundering-1bn-at-tornado-cash/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> laundering over $1.2 billion in illicit funds.</a></p>

<p>According to Dutch prosecutors, Pertsev, who was arrested in August 2022, is accused of habitually engaging in money laundering activities.</p>
<p>However, his defense lawyer, Keith Cheng, maintains that the indictment lacks specificity regarding the exact acts Pertsev is alleged to have committed in relation to the criminal offense.</p>
<h2><strong>Tornado Cash Unveiled: Indictment Links Pertsev To Crypto Laundering</strong></h2>
<p>The indictment provides a glimpse into the state&#8217;s case, asserting that Pertsev was a co-perpetrator in laundering assets through <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0916" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Tornado Cash</a>, a cryptocurrency mixer designed to obfuscate transaction trails.</p>
<p>Prosecutors have identified 36 transactions from decentralized protocols to Tornado Cash, including significant amounts of Ethereum (ETH) originating from platforms such as Ronin Bridge, which suffered a $625 million hack in 2022, linked to North Korean cyber group Lazarus.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/hoMe8Fwb/" width="1835" /></p>

<p>Decentralized protocols like Harmony and Nomad Bridge, both of which were associated with heists, are also mentioned in the indictment. US officials had previously sanctioned Tornado Cash, alleging its involvement in laundering millions of dollars from these incidents.</p>
<p>Following Pertsev&#8217;s arrest in the Netherlands, he was detained for nearly nine months and is presently subject to GPS monitoring with travel restrictions.</p>
<h2><strong>Stakes High: Pertsev Trial Could Set Precedent For Crypto Developers</strong></h2>
<p>The outcome of Pertsev&#8217;s trial holds significant implications for the cryptocurrency community. A guilty verdict could potentially create a chilling effect, resulting in developers and the open-source community fearing repercussions from US authorities for their involvement in projects that might later be deemed suspicious. Many within the crypto sphere view the case against Pertsev as an assault on coding itself.</p>
<p>Supporters ranging from major cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase to Ethereum developer Preston Van Loon and the Blockchain Association in Washington have rallied to Pertsev&#8217;s defense.</p>
<p>They argue that the act of software development should not be equated with participation in money laundering or similar crimes. This perspective aligns with the defense&#8217;s contention that the indictment lacks clarity on Pertsev&#8217;s specific actions.</p>

<p>Dutch prosecutors have hinted at a potential key element of their case, acknowledging the argument that software development cannot be inherently linked to criminal activities.</p>
<p>As the trial unfolds, it is likely that both the defense and prosecution will delve deeper into the complex intersection of coding, money laundering, and legal responsibility in the cryptocurrency landscape.</p>
<p>The trial of Alexey Pertsev is poised to be a pivotal event that could shape the future of cryptocurrency development and the regulatory landscape surrounding it.</p>

<title>Can Solana Exist Without Layer-2’s? Scalability Debate Ensues</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/can-solana-exist-without-layer-2s/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/can-solana-exist-without-layer-2s/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。Solana生态系统内的可扩展性辩论达到了白热化，主要围绕着Solana是否需要Layer-2（L2）解决方案展开。初始触发此辩论的是Solana项目DRiP的创始人Vibhu Norby提出的担忧，指出Solana面临的成本和技术挑战。开发人员对此有了反应，Solana基金会的BASED CHARKER强调了Firedancer项目的潜力，并认为Solana在未来2-3年内可能不需要L2解决方案。Solana Labs的联合创始人Anatoly Yakovenko从技术角度出发，认为硬件进步是解决可扩展性问题的关键。Norby还展望了Solana未来可能成为一个新互联网的愿景，预测将有数百万个应用程序建立在Solana上，创造一个比纳斯达克大100万倍的繁荣经济。 <div>
<p>The scalability debate within the Solana ecosystem has reached a fever pitch, fueled by pointed discussions on X (formerly Twitter) among leading figures in the blockchain space. At the heart of the debate is the question of whether Solana, a blockchain celebrated for its high throughput and low transaction costs, can maintain its performance and economic viability without resorting to Layer-2 (L2) solutions or <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/tezos-activates-mumbai-introduces-smart-rollups/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">rollups</a>.</p>
<h2>Does Solana Need L2?</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/vibhu/status/1770223481910874148" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">conversation</a> was kick-started by Vibhu Norby, the founder of the Solana-based project DRiP, who raised concerns over the escalating costs and technical challenges faced by applications operating on the SOL blockchain. Norby’s initial statement set the stage:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Controversial take that honestly really shouldn&#8217;t be. But want to put on the table a topic that has been happening in many private conversations. Solana is going to have and needs to have L2s and/or rollups.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>He detailed the substantial on-chain fees DRiP encountered, amounting to &#8220;$10,000 in on-chain fees last week,&#8221; underscoring the misalignment of incentives as app success paradoxically increases infrastructure costs. He remarked, &#8220;The very apps that bring traffic and customers to the chain are rewarded with increased infra cost when the token appreciates in value,&#8221; suggesting a misalignment between the ecosystem&#8217;s growth and its economic incentives.</p>

<p>This, according to Norby, necessitates a discussion on the scalability and economic model, suggesting that &#8220;I think many app builders will be happy to make calculated decentralization tradeoffs to have favorable economics and TPS.&#8221;</p>
<p>The response from the developer community was swift. BASED CHARKER, Global Developer Growth at the Solana Foundation, countered Norby&#8217;s perspective by highlighting the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/jump-crypto-solana-validator-client-software/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">potential of Firedancer</a>, a project aimed at significantly enhancing scalability.</p>
<p>Charker stated, &#8220;If Firedancer achieves what it set out to do and current issues are resolved (they will be) you’re not going to need a L2 in the next 2-3 years.&#8221; He acknowledged the frustrations of developers like Norby but remained optimistic about <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/why-solana-visa-reveals-reasons-for-partnership/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Solana&#8217;s roadmap</a> and its capacity to scale effectively without Layer-2 solutions.</p>

<p>Anatoly Yakovenko, the co-founder of Solana Labs, chimed in with a technical standpoint focusing on the hardware aspect: &#8220;Hardware won’t get conservative, though. Solana code base will get conservative when the only thing that validators need to do is add more cores.&#8221; This perspective suggests an enduring solution to scalability lies in leveraging hardware advancements, reinforcing the belief in the foundational technology to meet future demands.</p>
<p>The discourse also touched on the nature of blockchain evolution and market forces. Jordan Prince, co-founder of Solana-based B+J Studios, posited a market-driven outcome: &#8220;The free market always wins one way or the other! Either the base layer becomes fast enough and cheap enough quickly enough to avoid some tacked on L2, or it doesn’t and someone builds one first to solve the problem.&#8221;</p>
Vision For A Scalable Future
<p>Beyond identifying challenges, Norby also articulated a forward-looking vision for Solana, envisioning it as the foundation for a new internet. &#8220;I think I am way more bullish on Solana than anyone in the world. I foresee millions of apps built on this new internet called Solana. I think we are going to recreate all of our core internet apps including social, email, commerce, financial, etc.,&#8221; he stated.</p>
<p>This ambitious vision underscores Norby&#8217;s belief in Solana&#8217;s potential to host a vast and vibrant digital economy, far surpassing current applications and possibly challenging traditional internet infrastructure. However, he acknowledges the future need for &#8220;a plethora of scaling solutions, call them L2s or something else entirely,&#8221; in order to create &#8220;a thriving economy 1 million times bigger than the NASDAQ.”</p>

<title>Peter Schiff Questions True Agenda Behind MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Acquisition</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/peter-schiff-questions-microstrategys-bitcoin-buys/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。Peter Schiff披露了MicroStrategy公司购买比特币的真实意图，指出Michael Saylor可能在利用比特币价格操纵来卖掉自己的MSTR股份。Schiff批评通过ETF持有比特币存在的问题，认为拥有自己的数字货币比通过第三方提供的ETF更好。 MicroStrategy公司最近购买了大量比特币，已经损失了超过1.15亿美元，导致公司股票下跌超过16%。<br /> <div>
<p>Michael Saylor&#8217;s MicroStrategy is currently in the limelight, as Gold advocate and Bitcoin critic <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-hater-peter-schiff-scoffs-at-rally/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Peter Schiff</a> spells out the real intentions behind the tech company&#8217;s large BTC accumulation over time.</p>
<h2>Peter Schiff Unveils Michael Saylor&#8217;s Intentions In Bitcoin Buys</h2>
<p>Peter Schiff <a href="https://x.com/PeterSchiff/status/1770099578664030297?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">disclosed</a> the information about the Tysons-based tech firm on the social media platform X on Tuesday, causing quite a stir within the crypto community. Firstly, Schiff highlighted that the firm is currently &#8220;suffering a loss of over $115 million on the Bitcoin it recently purchased using borrowed funds.&#8221;</p>

<p>As a result, Schiff is curious why Michael Saylor continues to take out loans from its MSTR shares to purchase BTC, following a significant increase in the coin&#8217;s price.</p>
<p>According to the Gold advocate, it appears Michael Saylor carried out these moves with the main aim of &#8220;manipulating the price of Bitcoin to move up&#8221; while &#8220;selling off his own MSTR shares.&#8221;</p>
<p>The post read:</p>
<blockquote><p>MSTR is already down over $115 million on the BTC it just bought with borrowed money. I wonder why Michael Saylor always borrows money to buy Bitcoin after a big move-up. It looks like his true intention is to manipulate the Bitcoin price higher as he dumps his own MSTR shares.</p></blockquote>
<p>Schiff also <a href="https://x.com/PeterSchiff/status/1770091004483297486?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">mentioned</a> in another X post that MicroStrategy shares are &#8220;down by over 16%,&#8221; which might be due to the company selling the stocks to acquire more BTC. &#8220;Bitcoin Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) they have boosted are down by 6% and MSTR has fallen by 16%,&#8221; Schiff stated. </p>
<p>He further claimed that even after more than 3 hours of market coverage, &#8220;not once did CBNC talk about BTC nor the company&#8217;s favorite stock MSTR.&#8221; In addition, he stated that &#8220;CBNC is not telling its audience anything, while Bitcoin whales discreetly liquidate their stockpiles.&#8221;</p>
<p>Schiff&#8217;s revelation came in light of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/microstrategy-bitcoin-bet-btc/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">MicroStrategy</a>&#8216;s latest Bitcoin acquisition, purchasing around 9245 BTC valued at $623 million, in one week. MicroStrategy completed another convertible note offering to expand its BTC holdings, and presently, the company boasts 1% of the crypto asset&#8217;s overall supply.</p>
<p>When it comes to Bitcoin, Microstrategy has become one of the largest entities devoted to holding the digital asset. So far, the company has acquired about 190,000 BTC worth approximately $9.9 billion and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/michael-saylor-to-buy-bitcoin-forever-details/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">does not have any plans to sell the asset.</a></p>
<h2>Problem With Owning BTC Through ETFs</h2>
<p>Schiff continues to criticize the largest cryptocurrency asset, <a href="https://x.com/PeterSchiff/status/1770227134985895971?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">expressing</a> concerns regarding owning BTC through exchange-traded products. According to Schiff, &#8220;owning the coin&#8221; through an <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-markets-swell-in-2024-spotlight-bitcoin-etfs/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">ETF</a> has several setbacks, one of which is its &#8220;limited liquidity to US market hours.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is because if the market crashes during the night, investors will be &#8220;unable to sell&#8221; until the US market opens for business again the following morning, which can be extremely annoying to watch helplessly while being &#8220;unable to get out.&#8221; Thus, he believes that having your own <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-price-surges-to-new-all-time-high-is-100000-in-sight/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">BTC</a> is a far &#8220;better choice&#8221; than paying a third party to store it with limited liquidity.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Slide Decoded: Top Trader Provides Expert Analysis</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-slide-top-trader-provides-expert-analysis/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-slide-top-trader-provides-expert-analysis/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。比特币价格下跌，专家指出市场行为是主要原因。涌入高波动性的模因币导致价格下降。此外，多种因素如市场不确定性、大规模比特币ETF流出等也在拉低比特币价格。投资者转向模因币，可能影响比特币的稳定性，而技术分析显示比特币价格缺乏近期上涨信心。投资者需谨慎，注意投资风险和其对整个加密货币市场的影响。 <div>
<p>There has been a decline in Bitcoin that few predicted. An expert trader at Binance clarifies this tendency, arguing that it has to do with how the market behaves.</p>
<p>As the price of bitcoin rises, a lot of traders start to shift from their typical buying and selling locations. Rather, they use borrowed funds to gamble on highly volatile meme currencies in an attempt to chase after popular coins, which can fluctuate on a daily basis.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">When prices go up and on-chain/perps start moving people don&#8217;t need slots any more, they can just long the memecoin du jour on leverage.</p>
<p>— Tree (@Tree_of_Alpha) <a href="https://twitter.com/Tree_of_Alpha/status/1769866756548383136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">March 18, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<h2><strong>What Are The Factors Pulling Bitcoin Price Down?</strong></h2>
<p>Bitcoin is down today due to several factors impacting the cryptocurrency market. The price of the top crypto dropped 7% to as low as $62,400 on March 19, with a broader market correction reinforcing BTC’s resistance at the $68,000 level.</p>
<p>This decline was triggered by Bitcoin falling below $63,000, leading to a marketwide sell-off that saw the global crypto market capitalization drop 8% over the past 24 hours to rest at $2.4 trillion.</p>
<p>Additionally, more than $640 million worth of BTC flowed out of Grayscale’s spot Bitcoin ETF GBTC on March 18, contributing to a net outflow from spot BTC ETFs to $154 million.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/MKTFZ829/" width="2475" /></p>

<p>The market uncertainty, cooling of the recent bull run, and large-scale Bitcoin ETFs have also played a role in the decline. Long liquidations in the crypto futures market and a different market cycle have further driven the crypto market lower, with over $149 million in long positions being liquidated across the crypto market in the past 24 hours</p>
<h2><strong>Rush To Memecoins Threatens BTC Stability, Analysts Caution</strong></h2>
<p>Meanwhile, investors seeking quicker profits are rushing into volatile meme coins, potentially hindering the growth of established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, according to industry analysts.</p>
<p>The surge in meme coin buying coincides with rising prices for major cryptos like Bitcoin. However, this excitement for potentially explosive returns in meme coins may be causing neglect for the core market.</p>
<p>Analysts warn that the use of leverage, where investors borrow money to magnify their buying power, is prevalent in meme coin purchases. While this can amplify gains, it also significantly increases the risk of substantial losses.</p>

<p>This shift in investor focus away from Bitcoin could lead to a decrease in its buying pressure, causing its price to stagnate or even drop.</p>
<p>Technical analysis of Bitcoin&#8217;s price chart indicates a current lack of confidence in a near-term upswing. Key support levels around $56,260 and $51,802 could prevent a steeper price fall.</p>
<p>If Bitcoin can overcome resistance around $64,000, it might signal a return to its recent highs. Otherwise, the price could see a sustained drop or extended period of stagnation.</p>
<p>While meme coins offer the allure of high returns, investors should be aware of the associated risks and the potential impact of their choices on the broader cryptocurrency market.</p>

The parties express their intent, stating, &#8220;The proposal will ensure prompt, public access to the Parties’ briefs (as to which any proposed redactions are anticipated to be minimal), which is consistent with the &#8216;strong presumption&#8217; of public access.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Ripple Vs. SEC: The Detailed Remedies Timeline</h2>
<p><strong>March 22, 2024:</strong> The SEC is scheduled to file its opening <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-lawsuit-sec-remedies-briefing-deadlines/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">remedies-related brief</a> along with supporting declarations and exhibits, all under seal. This initial step allows the parties to review the documents and identify any sensitive information that might necessitate redaction before public release.</p>
<p><strong>March 25, 2024:</strong> Ripple and the SEC are set to meet and confer to discuss and agree upon the redactions to be applied to the SEC’s opening brief and its supporting materials. This collaborative approach is aimed at identifying and minimizing the extent of redactions, thereby maximizing the information available to the public.</p>
<p><strong>March 26, 2024:</strong> Following the meet and confer, the SEC will file a public, redacted version of its opening brief. This version will include only those redactions that were agreed upon by both parties (and third parties, if applicable) during the meeting. Furthermore, any supporting exhibits not classified as Confidential or Highly Confidential under the Protective Order will be filed on the public docket, enhancing the transparency of the proceedings.</p>

<p><strong>April 22, 2024:</strong> Ripple is expected to file its opposition brief and supporting documents. If these materials do not contain any information designated as Confidential or Highly Confidential by the SEC, they will be filed publicly but redacted. This ensures that confidential information remains protected while allowing public access to the case&#8217;s developments.</p>
<p><strong>April 23, 2024:</strong> Should Ripple’s materials include confidential information, a meeting is scheduled for this date to discuss redactions specific to Ripple&#8217;s opposition brief and its supporting documents.</p>
<p><strong>April 24, 2024:</strong> Ripple will file a public, redacted version of its opposition brief based on the previous day’s discussions, adhering to the agreed-upon redactions to protect sensitive information while maintaining the commitment to transparency.</p>
<p><strong>May 6, 2024:</strong> The SEC will submit its reply brief under seal, initiating the final phase of the sealing and redaction process.</p>
<p><strong>May 7, 2024:</strong> A meeting will occur to discuss and determine necessary redactions to the SEC’s reply brief and any accompanying exhibits, ensuring that any sensitive information is appropriately protected.</p>

<p><strong>May 8, 2024:</strong> The SEC is to file a public, redacted version of its reply brief along with any supporting exhibits not classified as Confidential or Highly Confidential. This step marks the culmination of the scheduled submissions and emphasizes the ongoing effort to balance confidentiality with the public&#8217;s right to access.</p>
<p><strong>May 13, 2024:</strong> Both parties, along with any third parties, will file omnibus letter-motions to seal materials related to the remedies-related briefing. This includes the briefs, declarations, and supporting exhibits, alongside proposed redactions to such materials, indicating a comprehensive approach to handling sensitive information within the case.</p>
<p><strong>May 20, 2024:</strong> The parties and any third parties involved are scheduled to file letter-briefs in opposition to the omnibus letter-motions to seal, facilitating a discourse on the necessity and extent of sealing certain documents and information.</p>
Insights Will Remain Concealed From The XRP Community
<p>This meticulously structured timeline officially demonstrates the parties&#8217; commitment to transparency, ensuring that the public remains informed of the case&#8217;s progress while safeguarding sensitive information. However, Bill Morgan, closely monitoring the case from the XRP community&#8217;s perspective, has a different <a href="https://twitter.com/Belisarius2020/status/1770215613417550085" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">opinion</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>For all those that thought the SEC succeeding earlier this year in its motion ordering disclosure of Ripple post-complaint contracts with institutions meant disclosure to the world it didn’t. It meant disclosure to the SEC subject to a protective order, and there is likely a lot of commercially sensitive material Ripple will seek to have redacted and sealed in the SEC brief and reply brief.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>At press time, XRP traded at $0.58657.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Boom In Argentina: Why More People Are Choosing Crypto Over Dollars</title>

<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-boom-in-argentina-why-more-people-are-choosing-crypto-over-dollars/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章介绍了阿根廷人在当前经济不稳定的情况下如何转向比特币来保值和获取增长。随着比特币价值上涨，人们逐渐放弃将比索兑换成美元的传统方式，转而寻求比特币的升值潜力和投资多样化。稳定币的使用减少，因为人们更看重比特币的增长潜力。然而，比特币市场存在安全风险和监管不确定性，阿根廷当局需要制定平衡的政策来促进创新并保护投资者。 <div>
<p>Argentina, a nation no stranger to economic turmoil, is witnessing a fascinating shift in how its citizens are safeguarding their wealth. With inflation persistently gnawing at the value of the peso, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-19/bitcoin-gains-dim-argentines-dollar-refuge-with-276-inflation" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Argentines are increasingly turning to Bitcoin</a> as a shield against the eroding purchasing power of their currency. This trend marks a potential turning point, potentially shaking the long-held tradition of exchanging pesos for US dollars as a hedge against inflation.</p>

<h2><strong>Fueling The Bitcoin Boom: Milei&#8217;s Policies And Disillusionment With The Dollar</strong></h2>
<p>The recent<a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/argentina-bitcoin-inflation-rally-dollar-greenback-dollarization-inflation-milei-peso-2024-3" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> surge in Bitcoin adoption in Argentina</a> coincides with the economic policies implemented by <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-enthusiast-javier-milei-secures-win/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">President Javier Milei.</a> His administration&#8217;s focus on controlling the money supply, aimed at stabilizing the economy, has seen a relative strengthening of the peso. While this is a positive development, it has also prompted Argentines to explore alternative options for<a href="https://www.livemint.com/economy/argentina-economy-crisis-uday-kotak-takes-aim-at-bad-macro-says-bitcoin-might-be-better-than-peso-during-inflation-11710904715869.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> inflation</a> protection.</p>
<p>The traditional method of converting pesos to dollars has lost some of its luster. The parallel exchange rate, where Argentines exchange pesos for dollars outside official channels, has strengthened by 10% against the US dollar in recent months. This, coupled with a stagnant or even declining dollar value globally, has made the greenback a less enticing option.</p>
<h2><strong>Bitcoin&#8217;s Allure: Appreciation Potential And Diversification</strong></h2>
<p>Bitcoin, on the other hand, has presented itself as a potentially more attractive proposition. During the same period when the peso saw a relative rise and the dollar stagnated, Bitcoin&#8217;s value skyrocketed by nearly 60%.</p>
<p>This significant appreciation potential is a major draw for Argentines looking to not just preserve the value of their savings, but also potentially see growth. Additionally, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/argentina-ngo-to-teach-high-schoolers-crypto/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin offers a valuable diversification</a> opportunity, allowing Argentines to move away from a reliance on solely fiat currencies, both domestic and foreign.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/TlzQFdd8/" width="2475" /></p>

<strong>Shifting Preferences: Stablecoins Take A Backseat</strong>
<p>An interesting wrinkle in this story is the observed decline in the use of stablecoins alongside the rise of Bitcoin. Stablecoins, crypto assets pegged to established currencies like the US dollar, are often favored for their price stability.</p>
<p>However, in Argentina&#8217;s current economic climate, where the focus seems to be on potential growth rather than pure value preservation, users are gravitating towards Bitcoin&#8217;s potential for appreciation. This highlights the evolving investment strategies Argentines are adopting in response to their unique economic situation.</p>

<strong>Challenges And Considerations: Security Concerns And Regulatory Uncertainty</strong>
<p>The surge in Bitcoin adoption in Argentina, while exciting, is not without its challenges. As with any new and emerging investment option, the risk of scams and fraudulent activity increases alongside popularity.</p>
<p>Bitcoin Argentina, a prominent cryptocurrency advocacy group, has reported a fivefold increase in scams in just February. This underscores the importance of investor education and the need for robust security measures to protect individuals venturing into the cryptocurrency space.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the regulatory landscape surrounding cryptocurrencies in Argentina remains somewhat uncertain. While the government hasn&#8217;t explicitly banned them, a lack of clear regulations could create challenges for both investors and businesses.</p>
<p>As the market evolves, it&#8217;s crucial for Argentinian authorities to develop a balanced approach that fosters innovation while ensuring consumer protection and financial stability.</p>

<title>Bitcoin ETF Fee War: Grayscale CEO Says GBTC Fees Will Drop Over Time</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etf-fee-war-grayscale-ceo-says-gbtc-fees-will-drop-over-time/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />巨头们为吸引客户，降低比特币ETF费用展开竞争。Grayscale CEO表示，尽管不参与当前费用战，GBTC将来会降低费用。尽管GBTC出现了120亿美元的资金流出，但CEO对其未来发展前景持乐观态度。他认为，市场仍有待探索，许多潜在投资者尚未接触到这些投资产品。 <div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The massive interest in Bitcoin ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) has created a war between issuers to attract clients to their products. The financial giants have taken different approaches to captivate the public, and lowering the fees has been a crucial component of these strategies.</p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Grayscale Unfazed By Bitcoin ETF Fee War</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In an <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/19/grayscale-ceo-says-gbtc-bitcoin-etf-fees-will-come-down-over-time.html?taid=65f967ca25aac600014c8104" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">interview</a> with CNBC, Michael Sonnenshein talked about the Bitcoin ETF fee war and the future of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) as the ETF market continues to expand.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">During the approval and subsequent launch process of the spot Bitcoin ETFs, most issuers tried to captivate the public’s interest with very low management fees. The battle continued as issuers extensively promoted their ETFs on different platforms to attract retail investors.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The asset managers have used Google ad campaigns, mainstream media advertisements, and a strong social media presence to compete against each other.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Grayscale CEO says fees on its bitcoin ETF will drop over time after outflows hit $12 billion <a href="https://t.co/lQnoMlC9YQ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://t.co/lQnoMlC9YQ</a></p>
<p>&mdash; CNBC (@CNBC) <a href="https://twitter.com/CNBC/status/1770033514810954013?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">March 19, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">However, the fee war remains the main incentive to attract new clients. The battle heated up after asset manager VanEck announced its fee waiver. The zero-fee approach until March 2025 is the firm’s latest strategy after falling behind its competitors.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The GBTC 1.5% management fee, defended by the CEO before, remains the highest among the competition. Nonetheless, in the CNBC interview, Sonnenshein announced that GBTC will reduce its fees in the future:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I’ll happily confirm that, over time, as this market matures, the fees on GBTC will come down.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The CEO further explained that during the early stages of a product’s lifecycle, the maintenance fees tend to be higher, but “as those markets mature, and as those funds grow, those fees tend to come down, and we expect the same to be true of GBTC.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Despite not participating in the current fee war, Grayscale recently <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etf-grayscale-spin-off-vaneck-slashes-fees/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">filed</a> for a new investment product called “Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust.” This product would transfer some of the fund’s BTC to the Mini Trust.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Presumably, it would cost much less than GBTC while operating independently. Sonnenshein told CNBC that “all of these new issuers came into the market to compete with us” while simultaneously competing with each other.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">GBTC’s Game Just Begun Despite $12 Billion In Outflows</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Grayscale’s <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/breaking-grayscale-scores-victory-against-us-sec-spot-bitcoin-etf-imminent/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">win against</a> the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) paved the way for the spot Bitcoin ETF approval in the US. However, despite managing the $26 billion GBTC, the digital asset manager has seen over $12 billion in capital outflows since the trust converted into an ETF in mid-January.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Net outflow of $154m on 18 March for the Bitcoin ETFs, driven by record $643m GBTC outflow <a href="https://t.co/ozlr7Ql9jH" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://t.co/ozlr7Ql9jH</a> <a href="https://t.co/r1Riwxjspo" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/r1Riwxjspo</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Farside Investors (@FarsideUK) <a href="https://twitter.com/FarsideUK/status/1769934849630994780?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">March 19, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Sonnenshein said during the interview that the firm anticipated having outflows. Although its high fees account for a considerable percentage of the liquidations, the CEO listed some of the reasons he considers would explain the massive numbers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Investors have been wanting to either take gains on their portfolio, or arbitragers coming out of the fund, or people unwinding positions that were part of bankruptcies through forced liquidation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The massive <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/grayscale-bitcoin-etf-outflows-end-experts/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">liquidations</a> didn’t come as a surprise. Nonetheless, the CEO believes that substantial outflows have sustained GBTC’s performance, as he believes the game is just beginning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We’re kind of at the end of that first inning now, where the pent-up demand for buying has hopefully been satisfied, the pent up demand for selling has also hopefully been satisfied.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Optimistic about the future of GBTC, the CEO believes that they are moving towards “that second and third inning” and that there’s still a lot of market to explore as many possible investors are yet to access these investment products.</p>

<title>Coinbase Gains Strong Support From Paradigm And Industry Leaders In SEC Battle</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/paradigm-industry-titans-rallying-behind-coinbase/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/paradigm-industry-titans-rallying-behind-coinbase/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章介绍了加密货币行业敦促美国证券交易委员会（SEC）为加密货币市场建立明确的规则和监管政策。主要参与者包括 Paradigm、加密技术创新委员会和美国商会，他们支持Coinbase向SEC提出明确指导加密货币行业的上诉。文章指出，加密货币行业挑战SEC的监管方法，认为SEC的现行规定不适用于加密货币的特性，缺乏关于加密货币的明确规范导致行业发展受阻。 Coinbase请求SEC制定明确的指导方针，并呼吁建立稳定的监管框架以平衡监管和创新。最终，加密货币行业要求SEC为加密货币行业制定规则以促进行业的发展。 <div>
<p>The cryptocurrency industry is pushing the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to establish clear rules and regulations for the crypto market. </p>
<p>Major players, including Paradigm, the Crypto Council for Innovation, and the US Chamber of Commerce, have argued with the district court to support Coinbase&#8217;s appeal to the SEC to provide specific guidelines for the crypto industry. </p>
<h2>Crypto Industry Challenges SEC&#8217;s Regulatory Approach</h2>
<p>In a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca3.121484/gov.uscourts.ca3.121484.20.0.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">court filing</a> submitted on Monday, Paradigm expressed interest in the case, highlighting the SEC&#8217;s continued refusal to issue final rules and guidance regarding cryptocurrencies, tokens, and related trading platforms. </p>
<p>Paradigms&#8217; legal team explained that despite bringing <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/fidelity-adjusts-ethereum-etf-application/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">enforcement actions</a> in the crypto space, the SEC has not adequately explained the legal basis for its authority, creating uncertainty for entrepreneurs and hindering the availability of judicial review. </p>
<p>The Crypto Council for Innovation and other industry stakeholders argue that the SEC&#8217;s current approach contributes to the ambiguity surrounding cryptocurrencies and hinders the industry&#8217;s progress. In addition, the Crypto Council asserts that the SEC&#8217;s current <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/velars-dharma-amm-lays-the-groundwork-for-a-new-defi-ecosystem-built-on-bitcoin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">regulatory framework</a>, designed for traditional securities, does not address the unique characteristics of crypto assets. </p>

<p>Unlike securities, crypto-assets do not rely on a centralized issuer and operate within decentralized networks and communities. As a result, the SEC&#8217;s focus on requiring disclosures from centralized issuers does not provide digital asset holders with the material information they need. </p>
<p>The filing reads that the current framework also imposes unnecessary intermediaries that hinder the disintermediated nature of crypto trading platforms. </p>
<p>Paradigm also points out that several crypto projects have attempted to comply with SEC registration requirements but have faced <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-price-down-today/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">significant challenges</a>. The SEC initially recommended using Form 10 for registration but later abandoned this approach, leading to the failure or stagnation of projects that followed it. </p>
<p>Other projects explored using the &#8220;Reg A&#8221; registration exemption, but according to the Crypto Council, this also proved “unworkable” when applied to crypto assets. Furthermore, the firm claims the existing regulatory framework, designed for traditional securities, does not address the unique characteristics and requirements of the crypto industry.</p>
<h2>Coinbase Urges SEC For Clear Guidelines</h2>
<p>Coinbase petitioned the SEC to create clear guidelines regarding when crypto assets should be classified as securities. Coinbase argued that the industry, valued at over $2 trillion, needs regulatory oversight and that companies are eager to comply with a well-defined framework. </p>
<p>The court filing further states that<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-brazilian-real-stablecoin-xrp-ledger/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> regulatory compliance</a> requires predictability, and Coinbase&#8217;s petition seeks to establish a stable balance between regulation and innovation. </p>
<p>Paradigm concluded its arguments by stating that the SEC&#8217;s current approach of regulation-by-enforcement, where attempts at compliance are met with punishment, does not provide the stability necessary for the industry to thrive. The filing concludes by asserting:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Court should vacate the agency’s denial of Coinbase’s rulemaking petition and remand with instructions for the SEC to engage in rulemaking.</p></blockquote>

<p>Ultimately, the crypto industry, represented by Paradigm, the Crypto Council for Innovation, and other stakeholders, is calling on the SEC to initiate <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/debt-box-judge-penalizes-sec-for-abuse-of-power/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">rulemaking </a>for the crypto sector. </p>
<p>The demand for clear guidelines stems from the SEC&#8217;s persistent refusal to provide comprehensive rules and guidance, hindering the growth and development of the industry. </p>
<img alt="Coinbase" class="size-large" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/pVFMDN3h/" width="1815" />
<p>Coinbase’s stock, traded under the COIN ticker, is currently valued at $228, reflecting a decline of more than 4% in the last 24 hours. This decline closely mirrors the price movement of Bitcoin (BTC), which has experienced a 5% drop, bringing its price to $64,200 at the time of writing.</p>

<title>$533 Million Crypto Longs Flushed As Bitcoin Plummets To $62,600</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/539-crypto-longs-flushed-bitcoin-plummets-63300/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/539-crypto-longs-flushed-bitcoin-plummets-63300/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。文章显示，比特币价格下跌至63,000美元以下，导致约5.33亿美元的加密货币多头合约被清算。随着比特币继续下跌，在过去24小时内其价格下跌了7%。加密衍生品市场在过去一天中经历了巨额清算，近6.57亿美元的合约被清算，80%涉及看涨市场。比特币和以太坊的清算额最高，分别为1.91亿美元和1.34亿美元。比特币持仓量仍处于相对极端的水平。 <div>
<p>Data shows that around $533 million in crypto long contracts have been flushed down as Bitcoin crashed below the $63,000 level.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Has Continued Its Recent Downtrend During The Past Day</h2>
<p>Since setting a new all-time high (ATH) above the $73,800 mark, Bitcoin&#8217;s fates have changed as the digital asset has switched to experiencing bearish momentum instead.</p>

<p>The coin has extended this latest drawdown in the last 24 hours, dropping its price by more than 7%. The chart below shows the cryptocurrency&#8217;s recent performance.</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Price Chart" class="alignnone size-medium" height="854" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/xZckr1PX/" width="1534" /></p>

<p>As the graph shows, Bitcoin has plunged to the $62,600 level for the first time in a few weeks. This means that BTC has declined by over 15% since the ATH.</p>
<p>While BTC&#8217;s performance in the past day has been bad, the rest of the sector has performed even worse on average, with some coins even dipping into double-digit losses.</p>
<p>Because of all this volatility, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-spot-derivatives-flow-spikes-bullish-price/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">derivative side of the market</a> has seen a shakeup as liquidations have piled up on the various exchanges.</p>
<h2>Crypto Derivative Market Has Seen Huge Liquidations In The Past Day</h2>
<p>A contract is said to be &#8220;<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-futures-liquidations-150m-bitcoin-plummets/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">liquidated</a>&#8221; when it amasses losses of a specific degree, leading to the platform with which it&#8217;s open stepping in and forcibly closing it off.</p>
<p>According to data from <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">CoinGlass</a>, many such liquidations have occurred in the cryptocurrency sector during the last 24 hours. The table below breaks down this market flush.</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin &amp; Crypto Liquidations" class="aligncenter wp-image-288261 size-full" height="302" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/table_0ac60b.png?resize=558%2C302" width="558" /></p>

<p>It would appear that almost $657 million in cryptocurrency derivative contracts have been liquidated in the past day. Given that the price action in the market today has been heavily towards the downside, it&#8217;s not surprising that the vast majority of this flush involved long contracts.</p>
<p>More specifically, the long side of the market has suffered $533 million in liquidations, while the short side has been dealt a $123 million blow. More than 80% of the liquidations have involved those betting on a bullish outcome for the asset.</p>
<p>In terms of the individual symbols, Bitcoin and Ethereum have again been at the top of the charts, with $191 million and $134 million in liquidations, respectively.</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin &amp; Other Cryptos" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-288262 aligncenter" height="294" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/data_7738b9.png?w=640&#038;resize=640%2C294" width="640" /></p>

<p>Out of the altcoins, Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE) have stood out with their $39 million and $14 million liquidations, respectively. Their large flushes may be partially due to their sharper drops than the other alts.</p>

<p>The chart below shows that despite the high liquidations, the Bitcoin Open Interest is still at relatively extreme levels.</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Open Interest" class="alignnone wp-image-288263 size-large aligncenter" height="275" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/chart_f0c95a.png?resize=980%2C275" width="980" /></p>

<p>The &#8220;<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-open-interest-alarming-levels-brace-impact/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Open Interest</a>&#8221; measures the total number of BTC-related contracts on the derivative market. Generally, the coin is more likely to show volatility when this metric is high, so sharp price action may continue until the indicator cools off more.</p>

<p>Popular doggy-themed cryptocurrency, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-price-soars-10-in-reaction-to-explosive-2367-shib-burn-surge/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Shiba Inu, </a>has surpassed previous record highs, experiencing a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-most-popular-crypto/">meteoric surge in popularity</a> and emerging as one of the most searched cryptocurrencies on Google.   </p>
<h2>Shiba Inu Google Searches Skyrocket</h2>
<p>Google Trends, an advanced tool developed by Google for analyzing the popularity of top search queries, has recently <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;q=shiba%20inu&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">unveiled</a> a notable surge in interest surrounding Shiba Inu. According to the analytics tool, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-records-surge-in-daily-new-addresses/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">SHIB</a>, the native token of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, is among the few meme coins witnessing both a rise in valuation and a surge in popularity lately. </p>

<p>Sharing a graphical representation of SHIB&#8217;s yearly interest over time, Google Trends disclosed a spike in global interest in <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-open-interest-40-crash/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Shiba Inu</a>, triggering a rise to some of the highest levels unseen in the past two years. </p>
<p>Presently, reports indicate that cryptocurrency has emerged as a focal point of interest for individuals across various countries. According to Google Trends, approximately 10 countries have been <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-whales-show-interest-positive-sign-shib/">displaying substantial interest in Shiba Inu</a>, contributing to its recent record high.</p>
<p>Countries like the Netherlands, Slovenia, Pakistan, Switzerland, Canada, Austria, Belgium and Nigeria have all played a role in driving Shiba Inu to its two-year peak in Google searches. Moreover, both the United States (US) and the United Kingdom (UK) have experienced a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shibarium-new-record/">surge in interest in Shiba Inu</a>, with investors and crypto enthusiasts alike showing great fascination with the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-whales-have-interest-in-shib-matic/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">doggy-themed meme coin.</a></p>
<h2>Why SHIB Is Becoming So Popular</h2>
<p>Since its inception in 2020,  Shiba Inu has been gaining a large amount of attention from investors and crypto enthusiasts alike. This elevated popularity is evident in its <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-founder-wallet/">thriving community</a> of supporters, boasting thousands of investors and advocates.</p>
<p>The unexpected rise in SHIB&#8217;s Google searches globally could be attributed to its recent <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-memecoins-3000-spike-volume-rally/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">price rallies</a> and the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-lead-dev-says-its-time-to-showcase-power/">ongoing development projects</a> within its ecosystem. In the last few months, Shiba Inu <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-blasts-into-top-10/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">witnessed a surge</a> of more than 200%, pushing its price up to the $0.00003 threshold. </p>

<p>However, following a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-shiba-inu-drop-15/">sharp correction</a>, the cryptocurrency has been trading well below its initial surge, currently at $0.000025, according to CoinMarketCap. Despite the decline, SHIB has been showing strong fundamentals, which is evident in the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shibarium-breaks-the-internet-again-with-over-400-million-layer-2-transactions/">rise in transactions on its Shibarium network</a> and the launch of the long-awaited <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shib-name-service-launch/">SHIB Name Service.  </a></p>
<p>The cryptocurrency has also succeeded in achieving the ranks of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-investing-meme-coins/">top 11 altcoins in the crypto space</a>, with a market capitalization of more than $14 billion. With current market sentiment, many analysts have also made <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/forget-dogecoin-shiba-inu-set-to-become-the-top-dog-expert-predicts-100-billion-market-cap/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">strong bullish projections</a> for the cryptocurrency, predicting that the meme coin could <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-dogecoin-shib-excitement/">surge to new all-time highs</a> during the 2024 bull run. </p>
<p>Shiba Inu’s future potential has also been confirmed by its lead developer, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-dogecoin-killer/">Shytoshi Kusama</a>, who believes that Shiba Inu could potentially overtake Dogecoin to finally become the “Dogecoin Killer.”</p>

<title>Bitcoin To Drop Even More If Prices Remain Below $70,300: Analyst</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-drop-prices-remain-below-70300/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-drop-prices-remain-below-70300/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。文章指出，如果牛市未能夺回70,300美元的支撑位置，比特币可能会下跌至59,000至62,000美元支撑区，这将导致价格从73,800美元的历史最高水平下跌20%。文章还提到了存在的并且有效的熊市分歧形态，并且强调了即将召开的美联储公开市场委员会（FOMC）会议对比特币价格的关键影响。此外，Grayscale出售更多比特币，现货ETF需求减弱，这可能对比特币产生负面影响。 <div>
<p>One analyst on X now thinks there is a high chance that Bitcoin will drop from spot levels to as low as the $59,000 to $62,000 support zone if bulls fail to reclaim $70,300. The drop will represent a 20% drop from all-time highs of $73,800.</p>
<h2>Eyes On FOMC After BoJ Shocker</h2>
<p>The analyst <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1769996367521353898" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">noted</a> a &#8220;valid&#8221; bearish divergence formation in the Bitcoin daily chart. Whenever a divergence forms, it means that there is a disconnect between price and momentum. With bears currently in command, forcing prices lower, the odds of prices falling even lower beyond the current lows appear elevated. </p>
<img alt="Bitcoin price trading below $70,300 | Source: Analyst on X" class="size-full wp-image-288227" height="548" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GJBKUGCXAAAPauH.png?resize=1024%2C548" width="1024" />
<p>For the ongoing uptrend to persist and for bulls to breathe a sigh of relief, a robust close above $70,300 is necessary. This potential upswing could decelerate the current sell-off and align prices with the dominant trend over the past few months. </p>
<p>The trader&#8217;s evaluation indicates that several fundamental factors will shape the short-to-medium-term price trajectory. The most significant of these is the anticipated direction of monetary policy from the imminent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in the United States on [March 20], which could substantially impact Bitcoin&#8217;s price. </p>

<p>Ahead of this meeting, the Bank of Japan (BoJ), the central bank of Japan, raised interest rates for the first time since 2007, sending shockwaves across the market. That the BoJ is raising rates means the global financial conditions, despite optimism, are still tight. Of note, inflation in the country rose. However, the central bank said they plan to keep interest rates at the current levels as long as &#8220;financial conditions&#8221; remain constant.</p>
<h2>Grayscale Selling More Bitcoin, Spot ETF Demand Waning?</h2>
<p>Aside from monetary policy, analysts highlight that recent outflows from Grayscale, amounting to approximately $154 million on March 18, resulted in a total outflow for the first time since March 1. Data from Lookonchain <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1769791163983167603" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">indicates</a> that Grayscale, winding down its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), released more coins than other spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuers purchased. </p>
<img alt="Grayscale unloading BTC | Source: Lookonchain via X" class="size-full wp-image-288226" height="768" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GI-Pn-agAEP5aS.png?resize=1024%2C768" width="1024" />
<p>Concurrently, the influx of capital into spot Bitcoin ETFs seems to be diminishing, a development that could be bearish for BTC. </p>

<p>Since its launch in January 2024, Bitcoin prices have been primarily propelled by demand for spot ETFs. </p>
<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/x/b7pGo1Sn/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Bitcoin price trending downward on the daily chart | Source: BTCUSDT on Binance, TradingView" class="size-full" height="904" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/b7pGo1Sn/" width="1787" /></a>
<p>For now, Bitcoin prices remain under immense selling pressure. The coin is edging lower, closer to the $60,000 round number. Whether or not bears will continue pressing prices lower remains to be seen. However, the broader crypto market remains bullish, and the upcoming halving event is expected to stir demand and lift prices.</p>

<title>Genesis Faces $21 Million Penalty As SEC Charges Are Settled</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/genesis-face-21-million-penalty-sec-charges-settled/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。<br />加密贷款商Genesis Global同意缴纳2100万美元的民事罚款并永久禁令，解决了与美国证券交易委员会(SEC)相关的未经注册的证券发售指控。SEC的调查发现，Genesis通过其加密资产借贷计划Gemini Earn程序进行了涉嫌的未经注册证券发售。Genesis已同意支付2100万美元的民事罚款，然而SEC将在所有其他允许的索赔，包括Gemini Earn程序的零售投资者索赔，在破产法院得到支付后才能获得其部分罚款。SEC主席Gary Gensler强调遵守证券法律的重要性，特别是对加密货币平台和中介机构。他指出，未注册这些产品并绕过披露要求并非可选，而是法定义务。 SEC执法部门主任Gurbir S. Grewal强调，没有炒作或广告可以代替证券法要求的投资者保护披露。Genesis还与纽约总检察长Letitia James提起的一起诉讼达成和解。目前，加密货币市场总价值出现6%下降，达到2.31万亿美元，同时，市场领头加密货币比特币(BTC)价格下跌6.6%，降至63000美元水平。 <div>
<p>Crypto lender Genesis Global, has agreed to a final judgment imposing a $21 million civil penalty and a permanent injunction as part of a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2024-37" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">settlement </a>with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). </p>
<p>The settlement resolves charges against Genesis related to the unregistered offer and sale of “securities” through its crypto asset lending program, the Gemini Earn program.</p>
<h2>Genesis Settles With SEC</h2>
<p>According to the SEC’s investigations, Genesis engaged in the alleged unregistered offer and sale of securities by operating the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/gemini-to-return-over-1-8b-to-earn-customers-in-regulatory-settlement/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Gemini Earn program</a> without proper registration. </p>

<p>The program allowed Gemini customers, including retail investors in the United States, to loan their <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/digital-currency-group-bankruptcy-code-violations/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">crypto assets</a> to Genesis in exchange for promised interest payments. However, in November 2022, Genesis announced that it could not honor withdrawal requests due to a lack of sufficient liquid assets following volatility in the crypto market.</p>
<p> At that time, Genesis held approximately $900 million in crypto assets from 340,000 Gemini Earn investors.</p>
<p>Genesis has agreed to pay a $21 million civil penalty for the settlement. However, the SEC will only receive its portion of the penalty after all other allowed claims, including those by retail investors in the Gemini Earn program, have been paid in the bankruptcy court. </p>
<p>Genesis and two of its affiliates had filed for voluntary <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/genesis-bankruptcy-plan-faces-criticism-dcg/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Chapter 11 bankruptcy</a> on January 19, 2023, in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.</p>
<h2>Legal Challenges Resolved</h2>
<p>SEC Chair Gary Gensler emphasized the importance of compliance with securities laws by <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/genesis-reaches-1-billion-settlement-with-3ac/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">crypto lending platforms</a> and intermediaries. He stressed that failing to register such products and bypassing disclosure requirements is not optional but a legal obligation. Gensler further stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today’s settlement builds on previous actions to make clear to the marketplace and the investing public that crypto lending platforms and other intermediaries need to comply with our time-tested securities laws. Doing so best protects investors. It promotes trust in markets. It’s not optional. It’s the law.</p></blockquote>
<p>Similarly, Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC&#8217;s Division of Enforcement, emphasized that no hype or advertising can substitute for the investor protection disclosures required by the securities laws.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that Genesis has also settled a separate <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/genesis-resolves-lawsuit-with-ny-attorney-general/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">lawsuit </a>filed by New York Attorney General Letitia James. The lawsuit, which initially targeted Genesis, Digital Currency Group, and Gemini, accused them of defrauding customers of $1.1 billion. However, the settlement disclosed in the New York bankruptcy court focuses solely on Genesis.</p>
<img alt="Genesis" class="size-large" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/Xrt0B8Fg/" width="1815" />
<p>As of the time of writing, the total value of the cryptocurrency market has experienced a 6% decline, reaching a valuation of $2.31 trillion. Simultaneously, Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency in the market, has undergone a 6.6% price correction, decreasing towards the $63,000 price level.</p>

<title>Crypto Analyst Predicts Explosive Rally For Shiba Inu’s BONE With New Target</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-bone-new-target/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-bone-new-target/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章介绍了BONE代币在Shiba Inu生态系统中的表现，包括价格波动和交易量增加。加密分析师SHIB Knight预测BONE代币将出现爆炸性涨势，预计价格将飙升至3美元。文章提到了BONE代币当前价格走势和未来展望，认为随着Shiba Inu生态系统的扩大，BONE有望获得更多价值。此外，BONE代币即将在知名交易所上市，这可能会推动价格进一步上涨。 <div>
<p>BONE, the second-biggest token in the Shiba Inu ecosystem, has had a mixed price movement in the past few days. This up-and-down movement has been accompanied by a surge in trading volume. Crypto analyst SHIB Knight is calling for an <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shibarium-4400-shib-bone/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">explosive rally</a> soon that could send BONE skyrocketing. Notably, the analyst is predicting a surge to $3.  </p>
<h2>Crypto Analyst Predicts Explosive BONE Rally</h2>
<p>BONE recently went on a 32% surge from $0.8191 to $1.0808 to outperform the larger crypto market as most cryptocurrencies <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-at-risk-65k/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">witnessed a decline in prices</a>. Interestingly, this surge was accompanied by a 60% increase in trading volume. </p>

<p>This surge in activity prompted a social media post from SHIB Knight. While acknowledging the rally, the analyst noted that the crypto is expected to “pump more.” The recent post came as an update to a former prediction over the weekend.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BONE&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">$BONE</a> is having a nice pump rn. It will pump more! <img alt="🔥" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f525.png" style="height: 1em;" /><img alt="🚀" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f680.png" style="height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/ao3YvsrJzS" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://t.co/ao3YvsrJzS</a> <a href="https://t.co/P7HbIDVkmk" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/P7HbIDVkmk</a></p>
<p>— $SHIB KNIGHT (@army_shiba) <a href="https://twitter.com/army_shiba/status/1769693757870379212?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">March 18, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>In the chart shared by the analyst, he noted how BONE has been trading in a channel with the formation of lower highs. He also pointed out how BONE had tried to break out of the upper trendline of this channel earlier but failed to do so. However, he remains unfazed and believes a breakout to $3 will happen sooner or later, though he doesn&#8217;t say when.</p>
<h2>What’s Next For BONE?</h2>
<p>Recent price action indicates that BONE has once again failed to break out of this upper trendline, as it has gone in the direction of the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-undergone-bearish-analyst-explains/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">wider bearish trend</a> of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/arbitrum/arbitrum-token-sell-off-whales-transfer-58m-to-exchanges-following-unlock-arb-price-reacts/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">most cryptocurrencies</a>. BONE has reversed most of its recent gains and has fallen by 20% in the past 24 hours and 22.3% in the past seven days. </p>
<p>At the time of writing, BONE is trading at $0.8638, and a surge to $3 would mean a 245% increase from the current price level. While this seems like a very bullish price point, the $3 price isn&#8217;t new territory for BONE, as it has a current all-time high of $15.50.</p>

<p>BONE acts as the governance token within the ShibaSwap decentralized ecosystem and as gas fees for Shibarium, Shiba Inu&#8217;s layer-2 scaling solution. <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-investing-meme-coins/">Team members</a> have proposed <a href="https://twitter.com/LucieSHIB/status/1769920586547867904?s=20" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">several developments</a> on the horizon that could significantly boost BONE&#8217;s price. Overall, BONE appears well-positioned to gain value as long as Shiba Inu&#8217;s ecosystem expands.</p>
<p>Despite its popularity, BONE is yet to be listed on popular exchanges <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-robinhood-bone/">like Robinhood</a> and Binance, and members of the “Shiba Army” have now taken it upon themselves to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bone-binance-shiba-inu-army-campaigns-for-listing/">campaign for a listing on Binance</a>. If successfully listed, the increased accessibility and visibility would likely lead to a price surge for BONE. Perhaps we could see <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bone/shiba-inu-bone-explodes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">increased BONE accumulation</a> from traders in the days leading up to the listing. </p>

<title>Elon Musk Sends Dogecoin Fans Into Frenzy With Cryptic Tweet</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/elon-musk-makes-another-cryptic-tweet/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/elon-musk-makes-another-cryptic-tweet/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章讨论了特斯拉创始人埃隆·马斯克在社交媒体上发布的有关梗币的推文引发的热烈讨论，以及他对人工智能领域的贡献。马斯克的推文历来备受争议，同时也对金融市场产生影响。他在Twitter上的行为和影响也引起关注，尤其是在他收购Twitter以来。 <div>
<p>Social media darling Elon Musk sent the meme-coin world into a tailspin with a seemingly innocuous St. Patrick&#8217;s Day tweet. The tech magnate, renowned for his affection for memes and his influence as &#8220;Dogefather&#8221;, posted a lighthearted image featuring three dogs adorned in festive green hats, one of them a Shiba Inu, the mascot of Dogecoin.</p>

<h2><strong>Memecoin Fans React To Elon Musk X Post</strong></h2>
<p>This seemingly casual social media activity sparked a vibrant response from the meme-coin community. Crypto accounts affiliated with Dogecoin, Floki Inu (FLOKI), and Shiba Inu (SHIB) flooded the replies with enthusiastic messages, some featuring their own canine mascots.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p></p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time Musk has, intentionally or unintentionally, impacted the meme-coin market. In 2021, a tweet showcasing his newly adopted Shiba Inu puppy, named Floki in homage to a character from Vikings, is believed to have triggered the launch of the Floki Inu coin. Interestingly, the same day witnessed the birth of Baby Doge Coin, further solidifying Musk&#8217;s reputation as a meme-coin kingmaker.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p></p>
<p>Meanwhile, as memecoin enthusiasts revelled in Musk&#8217;s festive tweet, the tech mogul was making significant strides on another technological front – Artificial Intelligence. His recently established company, xAI, has delivered on its earlier promise by open-sourcing Grok, its AI chatbot.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/bFxcyvE5/" width="1835" /></p>

<p>This move marks a significant contribution to the field of transparent AI development. By open-sourcing Grok, xAI has granted public access to the architecture and core functionalities of this mammoth 314 billion parameter language model.</p>
<h2><strong>Musk&#8217;s Twitter Impact: From Controversy To Financial Market Influence</strong></h2>
<p>The tweets made by Elon Musk have been <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-community-abuzz-musk-x-post/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">a subject of significant attention</a> and controversy due to their impact and content. Musk, a prolific tweeter with a massive following, has a history of posting tweets that have stirred both positive and negative reactions. Over the years, Musk has been known to delete tweets shortly after posting them, with hundreds being removed within hours of publication. </p>
<p>Notably, some of his tweets have led to serious consequences, such as the infamous tweet in 2018 where he claimed to have secured funding to take Tesla private at $420 a share, resulting in charges from the Securities and Exchange Commission and a subsequent settlement that imposed restrictions on his Twitter activity regarding Tesla.</p>

<p>The billionaire&#8217;s acquisition of Twitter and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/musk-x-rebrand-for-twitter-opposed/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">subsequent actions</a> as the platform&#8217;s owner have also drawn attention. Since taking over Twitter, Musk has expressed his commitment to free speech and diversifying voices on the platform. </p>
<p>However, despite his intentions, his Twitter feed has been criticized for often acting as an echo chamber, where he interacts mainly with accounts that support him or post about him.</p>
<p>This behavior has raised concerns about how Twitter may evolve under his leadership. Moreover, his tweets have had a direct impact on financial markets. Several instances stand out where his tweets influenced Tesla&#8217;s stock prices significantly. </p>
<p>For example, Musk&#8217;s tweet questioning Hertz Global Holdings Inc.&#8217;s deal to buy Teslas for its rental-car fleet led to a 3% drop in Tesla&#8217;s stock the following day. Similarly, his tweets about Tesla&#8217;s valuation or production predictions have caused fluctuations in the company&#8217;s stock prices.</p>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。微战略公司宣布用可转换票据和多余现金收购了9245个比特币，从而将公司持有的比特币总数增加到214,246个。该公司完成了一笔私人可转换票据的增发，总额达6.0375亿美元，引起市场广泛关注。Michael Saylor表达了对比特币的信心，并表示计划继续收购。社区对微战略公司的最新收购表示赞赏。击贬币 。. <div>
<p>On Tuesday, MicroStrategy announced the acquisition of an additional 9,245 BTC for approximately $623.0 million, using proceeds from convertible notes and excess cash. This purchase brings the company&#8217;s total holdings to 214,246 BTC. This figure represents more than 1.0% of the total 21 million Bitcoin that will ever exist, marking a significant milestone for both MicroStrategy and the community at large.</p>
<p>Michael Saylor, the CEO of MicroStrategy, <a href="https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1770061111146033385" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">shared</a> the news on X (formerly Twitter), stating, &#8220;MicroStrategy has acquired an additional 9,245 BTC for ~$623.0M using proceeds from convertible notes &amp; excess cash for ~$67,382 per #bitcoin. As of 3/18/24, MSTR hodls 214,246 BTC acquired for ~$7.53B at average price of $35,160 per bitcoin.”</p>
<p>The funding for this significant acquisition came from a private offering of convertible senior notes, which concluded with an upsized aggregate principal amount of $603.75 million. This offering attracted substantial interest, leading to an oversubscription and the exercise of an option by initial purchasers to buy an additional $78.75 million worth of notes.</p>

<p>According to MicroStrategy&#8217;s official <a href="https://www.microstrategy.com/press/microstrategy-completes-603-million-offering-of-0875-convertible-senior-notes-due-2031_03-19-2024" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a>, &#8220;The Offering, which included a 0.875% coupon and an approximately 40% conversion premium over the US composite volume weighted average price of MicroStrategy’s class A common stock, was well received in the marketplace.&#8221;</p>
<p>The convertible notes, due in 2031, offer flexibility to holders with rights for early repurchase and conversion into cash, shares of MicroStrategy&#8217;s class A common stock, or a combination thereof under specific conditions. This innovative financial instrument reflects <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/microstrategy-bitcoin-bet-btc/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">MicroStrategy&#8217;s sophisticated approach</a> to capital management and its bullish outlook on Bitcoin.</p>
<h2>The Bitcoin Community Reacts</h2>
<p>The community has lauded MicroStrategy&#8217;s latest acquisition. Bitcoin Munger <a href="https://twitter.com/bitcoinmunger/status/1770059884085621201" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">commented</a>, “Saylor is like a kid in a candy store with this current dip. Still surprised that the market would give him this dip, but coins are moving from lettuce hands to diamond hands.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, prominent figures like Dylan LeClair and WhalePanda have acknowledged the company&#8217;s significant market position, with LeClair <a href="https://twitter.com/DylanLeClair_/status/1770061493922382059" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">stating</a>, “&gt;1.0% of 21,000,000 Bitcoin. Congrats Saylor &amp; MicroStrategy. Legendary,” and WhalePanda <a href="https://twitter.com/WhalePanda/status/1770059536847536163" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">adding</a>, “Saylor thanks you for your weak hands.”</p>

<p>MicroStrategy&#8217;s aggressive accumulation of BTC not only demonstrates its confidence in the digital currency as a viable investment asset but also could have significant impact on market dynamics. This milestone of holding more than 1% of all BTC&#8217;s in existence is a monumental step for Saylor.</p>
<p>More recently, Michael Saylor&#8217;s bet on BTC was compared to Nelson Bunker Hunt&#8217;s historical attempt to corner the silver market. Both invested heavily with the conviction that their chosen asset (<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/rap-star-drake-bitcoin-to-the-masses/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">BTC for Saylor</a>, silver for the Hunts) was undervalued and poised for significant appreciation. Each believed strongly in the future value of their chosen asset, seeing it as a hedge against economic uncertainty and inflation.</p>

<p></p>
<p>In a recent <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/microstrategy-bitcoin-end-game-saylor-plan/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">interview</a>, Saylor proclaimed that he has no plans to sell BTC. “We think Bitcoin is the highest form of property, the apex property in the world, and it’s the best investment asset, so the end game is to acquire more Bitcoin. Whoever gets the most Bitcoin wins. There is no other end game,” Saylor said.</p>
<p>At press time, BTC traded at $63,723.</p>

<title>Mega Bank Says Ethereum Price Could Reach $14,000, Here’s Why</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-price-reach-14000/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。标准银行预测以太坊价格将飙升至14,000美元，主要受到美国证券交易委员会可能批准以太坊现货交易所交易基金的驱动。分析师预计，如果SEC批准ETH ETF，以太坊价格将在2025年前达到14,000美元。预测还涉及到以太坊ETF将带来450亿美元的资金流入市场。此外，以太坊2.0升级和投资者对加密货币的需求也将推动以太坊价格上涨。 <div>
<p>Leading international cross-border bank, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/standard-chartered-sees-bitcoin-200k/">Standard Chartered</a> has made another bullish prediction for Ethereum. According to analysts from the bank, ETH could see a rise to new all-time highs, driven by the potential introduction of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/approval-denial-ethereum-etf-sell-the-news-event/">Spot ETH Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). </a></p>
<h2>ETH Price Set To Rise To $14,000</h2>
<p>Analysts at Standard Chartered Bank have maintained an <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-takes-hit-3680/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">optimistic outlook for ETH</a>, anticipating that the second-largest cryptocurrency could witness an exponential surge to $14,000 by 2025. </p>

<p>Detailed in a Monday note, the analysts revealed <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-aims-for-10000-driven-by-2-key-factors-according-to-experts/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">key factors</a> that could drive Ethereum towards the predicted price target. Notably, the potential <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-etf-issuers-brace-for-sec-march-meeting/">approval of an Ethereum Spot ETF</a> by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is a primary catalyst for ETH&#8217;s projected surge. </p>
<p>According to the analysts at Standard Chartered, if the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/coinbase-sec-5-arguments-spot-ethereum-etf/">SEC greenlights Spot Ethereum ETFs</a>, ETH could follow a straight road map to <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/standard-chartered-bitcoin-ethereum-prediction-year-end/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">$8,000 by the end of 2024</a> and $14,000 by 2025. The analysts have maintained an optimistic outlook regarding the approval of Ethereum Spot ETFs, anticipating the SEC’s authorization by May 2024. </p>
<p>The firm emphasized yet another significant factor that could propel the price of ETH to $14,000 &#8211; <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-finalizes-dencun-upgrade-on-testnets/">Ethereum’s recent Dencun upgrade. </a>Geoffrey Kendrick, Standard Chartered’s Head of Forex and Crypto Research anticipates an influx of demand for the cryptocurrency, citing potential <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-fees-spike-but-relief-on-the-horizon/">reduction in transaction costs</a> and improvements to the Ethereum blockchain facilitated by upgrade as key drivers.</p>
<h2>Ethereum Spot ETFs Projected To Draw $45 Billion</h2>
<p>In addition to his <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-new-5000-target/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">bullish projections for ETH</a>, Kendrick has also stated that Spot Ethereum ETFs could trigger a whopping $45 billion in inflows into the market. While there has been a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cloudy-future-for-ethereum-etfs-whats-casting-doubt-on-their-fate/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">decline in overall optimism</a> regarding the SEC’s potential approval of Ethereum ETFs by May, the analyst has maintained a positive outlook, affirming the possibility of the SEC granting approval for these investment assets by the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sec-bitcoin-ethereum-etfs-deadline/">specified deadline</a> of May 23, 2024. </p>

<p>According to Kendrick’s insights shared with The Block, he has estimated inflows ranging from $15 billion to $45 billion within the first 12 months following the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-etfs-approval-odds-drop-to-35/">approval of Spot ETH ETFs. </a></p>
<p>The crypto analyst indicated that he intends to apply the same methodology for estimating <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etfs-new-ath-inflows-coinbase-reserves/">Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows</a> in his analysis. His reasoning suggests a similar trajectory for ETH&#8217;s future outlook as witnessed with Bitcoin following its ETF approval. </p>
<p>Just as millions of dollars poured into the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/without-spot-bitcoin-etfs-btc-down-20-founder/">Spot Bitcoin ETF</a> market after the SEC’s acceptance, a similar scenario could potentially unfold for Ethereum if its ETF is authorized. In such an event, the price of the cryptocurrency could witness a significant rise to <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-rally-4k/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">new all-time highs</a>, propelled by a surge in investor interest and capital inflows.</p>

<title>This Signal Points To End Of Bull Phase For Bitcoin, Quant Says</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/signal-points-end-bull-phase-bitcoin-quant-says/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> 摘要：<br /><br />这些信息是消极的。一位量化分析师指出比特币在链指标NUPL显示出了一个可能暗示牛市可能接近尾声的模式。NUPL指标显示投资者持有的未实现利润或损失数量，最近已经进入过热水平多周。历史数据表明，当NUPL超过0.6水平时，比特币往往会出现顶部和价格回调。当前NUPL处于“过热”区域已经将近3周，这可能预示着比特币可能面临更强烈的价格调整。比特币目前交易于约63,000美元，过去一周下跌12%。 <div>
<p>A quant has pointed out a pattern in a Bitcoin on-chain indicator that may imply the bull phase may be close to ending for now.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin NUPL Has Been At Overheated Levels For Weeks Now</h2>
<p>In a CryptoQuant Quicktake <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/65f89926bcdd3c42d0a27b8c-Another-sign-of-bull-phase-ending" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, an analyst has talked about a bearish development that has recently occurred in the Bitcoin &#8220;<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/the-bitcoin-bull-cycle-is-underway-analyst-confirms/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Net Unrealized Profit/Loss</a>&#8221; (NUPL) indicator.</p>
<p>As its name already suggests, the NUPL keeps track of the net amount of unrealized profit or loss that the investors of the cryptocurrency as a whole are holding right now. This metric works by going through the on-chain history of each token in circulation to see what price it was last moved at.</p>

<p>With the assumption that the previous transfer for any coin was the last point it changed hands, the metric subtracts the price at its time from the current price to find the exact amount of profit or loss it is currently carrying.</p>
<p>The indicator then sums up these values for the entire circulating supply to determine the net profit/loss status of the market. Naturally, positive values imply the investors as a whole are in the green, while values under zero imply the dominance of underwater supply.</p>
<p>Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin NUPL over the past few years:</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin NUPL" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="975" src="https://i0.wp.com/img.cryptoquant.com/322923/quicktake/qnGDqmBB0_4ade16ab9a5ca400aa560adf3c6692e22209f53fe4253aa66145fc2399c8b36f.png?resize=1680%2C975&#038;ssl=1" width="1680" /></p>

<p>As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin NUPL has attained highly positive levels recently, which is obviously a natural conclusion of the sharp rally the cryptocurrency has gone through.</p>
<p>During this surge, the indicator has managed to breach the 0.6 level. The quant has pointed out, however, that historically, it has been quite rare that the asset has been able to sustain above this mark.</p>
<p>This pattern is visible in the chart, as tops have often been encountered as the NUPL has crossed this boundary. Only periods where the indicator did manage to continue to surge past this level in recent years was during the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/founder-btc-bitcoin-bull-run-just-getting-started/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">bull runs</a> in 2017 and first half 2021.</p>
<p>Even the November 2021 price all-time high (ATH) was hit not too long after the indicator entered this territory of overheating. &#8220;We have been in the &#8220;overbought&#8221; zone for almost 3 weeks now and in the past it took between 3 to 6 weeks before a stronger correction in price occurred,&#8221; notes the analyst.</p>

<p>Thus, going by this historical pattern, it&#8217;s possible that a steep correction may be coming for Bitcoin in the near future, or it may have even already started considering the recent price plunge.</p>
<p>Usually, investors in profit are more likely to sell their coins and this tendency to sell goes up the more their profits swell. This is why historically the asset has been probable to see <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-inflows-binance-spike-whales-2024-selloff/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">selloffs</a> at high values of the NUPL.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $63,000, down 12% over the past week.</p>

<title>Fidelity Adjusts Ethereum ETF Application, Optimistic About Regulatory Approval</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/fidelity-adjusts-ethereum-etf-application/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/fidelity-adjusts-ethereum-etf-application/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章讨论了多个金融管理公司申请以太坊现货ETF产品的情况。财务管理公司Fidelity修改了其申请，展现出对美国证券交易委员会（SEC）批准的信心。该更新包含对现货和期货市场之间联系的更彻底的考察。此外，Grayscale也更新了其以太坊ETF提案，这对于将ETHE上市至NYSE Arca是一个关键步骤。最后，文章提到了Fidelity计划允许交易者在其提议的以太坊基金中抵押资产的计划，以及提到了以太坊网络奖励的相关信息。 <div>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-etfs-jeopardy-staking-yields-bitmex/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Spot Ethereum Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)</a> may be witnessing a decline in approval odds, but there is still a wave of optimism among several financial management firms applying for the products.</p>
<h2>Fidelity Amends Its Ethereum Spot ETF Application</h2>
<p>Amid the anticipation encompassing the Ethereum spot ETFs, financial management giant <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sec-delays-fidelity-spot-ethereum-etf/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Fidelity</a> has recently amended its application for the exchange products, demonstrating confidence toward approval by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>



<p>Chairman and President of The ETF Store, Nate Geraci, took to the social media platform X to <a href="https://x.com/NateGeraci/status/1769893614576980281?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">share</a> the update with the crypto community today. According to Nate Geraci, the amendment contains a &#8220;more thorough examination&#8221; of the connection between the spot and futures markets.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that Fidelity entered the competition to introduce an Ethereum ETF in November last year. Other applicants for the ETFs include Grayscale, Ark Invest, 21Shares, and BlackRock, among others.</p>
<p>Geraci mentioned that the update cites the acceptance of a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/4-bitcoin-etfs-get-nod-190-billion-wealth-manager/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">spot Bitcoin ETF</a>. He also shared a screenshot from the latest filing, while noting that the passage is the &#8220;money page.&#8221; This is because the &#8220;SEC will not be let off the hook by Ethereum ETFs issuers.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the filing, Fidelity claims that &#8220;given the firm correlation between Ethereum and Bitcoin futures offered by Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), applying the same grounds that the SEC used to approval a spot Bitcoin product suggests that the test is satisfied for this proposal.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the &#8220;SEC anticipates that the CME&#8217;s surveillance will help identify potential instances of deceptive and manipulative acts,&#8221; the financial firm argues that &#8220;<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-analyst-bullish-on-ethereum-and-xrp/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ethereum </a>ETFs should be identified using the same logic.&#8221;</p>
<p>By updating its application, Fidelity plans to permit traders and users in its proposed Ethereum fund to stake a portion of the assets. The Registration Statement <a href="https://cdn.cboe.com/resources/regulation/rule_filings/pending/2023/SR-CboeBZX-2023-095-Amendment-No-1.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">states</a> that the &#8220;Sponsor may occasionally stake a portion of the Fund&#8217;s assets through one or more reputable staking providers, some of whom may be Sponsor affiliates or Staking Providers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Additionally, &#8220;the Fund would get specific network rewards in the form of Ether tokens&#8221; for any staking activity it might perform. These rewards could be considered as &#8220;income for the Fund&#8221; as compensation for the services rendered. </p>
<h2>Grayscale Updates Its ETH ETF Proposal</h2>
<p>Fidelity is the latest firm to amend its Ethereum spot ETF application after financial behemoth Grayscale. On Friday, Grayscale <a href="https://x.com/CraigSalm/status/1768750794021511218?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reported</a> that the firm had updated its proposal for the products, which marks a vital step in uplisting ETHE to NYSE Arca.</p>

<p>As with spot Bitcoin ETFs, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-funds-lose-500m-as-grayscales-outflow-wanes/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Grayscale</a> thinks the case for spot ETH ETFs is just as strong, and investors demand and deserve exposure to ETH in this aspect.</p>
<p>In compliance with the guidelines mentioned in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, Section 19(b) and Rule 19b-4, NYSE Arca intends to list and trade the shares of the following under NYSE rule 8.201.</p>

<title>Why Is The Shiba Inu Price Down Today?</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-price-down-today/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-price-down-today/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是负面的。<br />在过去的一天里，由于比特币价格失去了65000美元的支撑，Shiba Inu遭受了巨大的下跌。这次市场崩溃部分是对即将于3月20日星期三举行的美联储公开市场委员会（FOMC）的反应。Shiba Inu的价格跌幅超过10%，市场遭受了严重打击。然而，一位分析师认为，尽管目前的状况不佳，Shiba Inu仍然表现出强大的力量，并预计它将很快反弹。 <div>
<p class="p2">The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-investing-meme-coins/">Shiba Inu price</a> has seen a massive drawdown in the last day as the Bitcoin price lost its support at $65,000. As a result, the SHIB price is down more than 10% in a single day, with what is arguably one of the worst crypto trading days in crypto so far this year. But what is behind this market crash?</p>
<h2 class="p2">Crypto Market Fumbles On FOMC</h2>
<p class="p2">The crypto market seems to be already reacting to the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">meeting</a> which is scheduled to take place on Wednesday, March 20. Expectations are quite lax for the outcome of the meeting. Nevertheless, investors and traders are looking toward the outcome as something that could significantly impact the crypto market.</p>

<p class="p2">Alongside this, Bitcoin is also going through an expected correction after what has been a green year, moving from $20,000 to a new all-time high above $73,000. As <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoins-price-trajectory-analyst-spells-out-three/">the Bitcoin price</a> sees a correction through this crash, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-burn-rate-2300/">likes of Shiba Inu</a> have also seen their prices correct sharply as well.</p>
<p class="p2">Shiba Inu’s double-digit losses have triggered a decline toward $0.000052, eliminating around 50% of its gains from the last month. Likewise, the daily trading volume of the meme coin has taken a significant hit as well, with CoinMarketCap data showing a 28.4% crash to bring its daily trading volume to $1.73 billion.</p>
<p class="p2">The meme coin is down more than 22% on the weekly chart as well, which has brought its market cap to $14.89 billion. As a result of this, Shiba Inu continues to lag as the 11th-largest cryptocurrency in the world behind rival <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-shiba-inu-drop-15/">Dogecoin</a>, which sits in the 10th spot.</p>
<h2 class="p2">What’s Next For Shiba Inu?</h2>
<p class="p2">For now, the whole crypto market, including Shiba Inu, looks to be following Bitcoin’s lead. This means that any further decline or recovery in the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-burn-rate-2300/">SHIB price</a> will be directly tied to the outcome for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-targets-500000-scary-dips/">Bitcoin</a>, and since <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoins-price-trajectory-analyst-spells-out-three/">BTC</a> is currently in its pre-halving crash, it might continue to struggle until the halving in April.</p>

<p class="p2">However, this has not affected the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-price-0-0001-target/">bullish outlook</a> that investors have for the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-shiba-inu-drop-15/">SHIB price</a> as one analyst believes that this is only a temporary setback. Crypto Analyst Javon Marks took to X (formerly Twitter) to <a href="https://x.com/JavonTM1/status/1768049122290929876?s=20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reveal</a> that Shiba Inu has shown massive strength since 2023. But there is still more to go.</p>
<p class="p2">Marks continues to stand by his breakout target of $0.000081 for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-investing-meme-coins/">SHIB</a>, which from current price levels, would see it do another 350% move to get there. So while <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-price-0-0001-target/">SHIB</a> has suffered in the last day, expectations are that it will turnaround soon.</p>

This event signifies a crucial advancement for the XRP Ledger and its ecosystem, offering a new layer of stability and efficiency for cross-border and domestic transactions.</p>
<h2>Ripple Praises New BRL Stablecoin</h2>
<p>“Designed to facilitate seamless and cost-effective transactions, BRLA Token offers businesses a reliable avenue for both domestic and international payments. The team has been exploring and testing the XRP Ledger extensively for payment processing, with much more excitement on the horizon,” RippleX stated in a blog post.</p>
<p>BRLA Digital, spearheading this innovation, aims to disrupt the traditional <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/is-brazil-ready-for-the-crypto-economy-the-data-agrees-vehemently/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">financial sector in Brazil</a>. Their creation, the BRLA Token, is crafted to simplify and economize business transactions, both internationally and within the country.</p>
<p>RippleX&#8217;s enthusiasm about this collaboration is evident. In a <a href="https://twitter.com/RippleXDev/status/1769830638817821006" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">statement</a> shared on X (formerly Twitter), they remarked, &#8220;BRLA Digital&#8217;s commitment to evolving Brazil&#8217;s financial scene comes to fruition with the BRLA Token. This venture into stablecoins signifies a pivotal stride towards redefining business transactions in Brazil.&#8221;</p>

<p>This initiative by BRLA Digital to bring the BRLA Token to the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-ledger-partnership-to-integrate-smart-contracts/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">XRP Ledger</a> showcases an ambitious effort to bridge the gap between conventional financial services and the burgeoning field of digital currency. Focusing on business-to-business (B2B) transactions, the move is designed to streamline payment processes, making them more accessible and less susceptible to the unpredictability of cryptocurrency markets.</p>
Key Features Of The BRLA Token
<p>Central to the value proposition of the BRLA Token is its foundation in stability. &#8220;By anchoring the BRLA Token&#8217;s value to the Brazilian Real and backing it with audited reserves, we ensure a stable and reliable medium for transactions, shielding businesses from the whims of cryptocurrency volatility,&#8221; explains Ripple. This stability is crucial for businesses seeking consistency in their financial operations.</p>
<p>Transparency is another pillar upon which the BRLA Token stands. &#8220;Our commitment to transparency is unwavering, with regular, audited transparency reports that reaffirm the token&#8217;s solid backing,&#8221; BRLA Digital asserts. This openness is intended to build trust among users, reassuring them of the token&#8217;s integrity and the security of their transactions.</p>

<p>Regarding security, Ripple emphasizes the decentralized and secure nature of the BRLA Token transactions on the blockchain. &#8220;We leverage Brazil&#8217;s safest asset class, government treasury bills, through the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/brazil-itau-unibanco-launche-bitcoin-ethereum-trade/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">nation&#8217;s most reputable banks</a>, ensuring the utmost security and integrity of the BRLA Token&#8217;s backing,&#8221; they note.</p>
Transforming Brazilian Payments
<p>RippleX&#8217;s blog post further illuminates the innovation the BRLA Token brings to the financial sector: &#8220;The BRLA Token not only facilitates transactional efficiency but also spearheads the development of decentralized applications rooted in the Brazilian Real, heralding a new era of financial solutions on the blockchain.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team behind BRLA Digital, comprising industry veterans like Matheus Moura, Luiz Castelo Branco, Lucas Giorgio, Hector Fardin, and Leandro Noel, is celebrated by Ripple for their combined expertise in finance, technology, and entrepreneurship. Their collective experiences, enriched by past ventures and academic achievements at the Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica (ITA), fuel their mission to revolutionize Brazil&#8217;s financial infrastructure.</p>
<p>At press time, XRP traded at $0.5852.</p>

<title>Crypto Exchange OKX Delists USDT Trading In Europe – Here’s Why</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。OKX决定在欧洲经济区停止交易对，以配合即将出台的MiCA法规，并专注于欧元流动性。此举符合行业日益加强的监管趋势。OKX还推出OKX Argentina，并希望成为该地区的重要参与者。尽管可能存在一些准备不足的问题，但OKX的积极举措显示了对监管遵从的重视。 <div>
<p>In a strategic move ahead of regulatory changes, OKX, the fourth-largest global cryptocurrency exchange, has decided to discontinue <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">USDT</a> trading pairs in the European Economic Area (EEA).</p>
<p>The decision, aimed at aligning with forthcoming Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations, reflects the exchange&#8217;s focus on euro-denominated liquidity within the region. OKX aims to become the preferred venue for euro to crypto spot trading and plans to expand its product offering in the EEA by introducing a variety of Euro fiat onramps and Euro pairs.</p>

<h2><strong>OKX Aligns with MiCA: USDT Trading Suspension Signals Compliance Efforts</strong></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-18/crypto-exchange-okx-to-pull-tether-trading-pairs-in-europe" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">discontinuation of USDT trading pairs</a> is expected to impact users located in the EEA, and the prohibition will be fully enforced until December 30, 2024. This move signifies a proactive stance by OKX and other exchanges towards complying with local and international financial regulations, particularly in light of the MiCA framework.</p>
<p>MiCA is a comprehensive regulatory approach aiming to govern stablecoins like USDT, protect the European Union&#8217;s financial ecosystem, and foster innovation in the fintech sector.</p>

<p></p>
<p>While the impact of these regulatory actions on the cryptocurrency market remains uncertain, OKX&#8217;s decision reflects a growing trend towards increased regulatory adherence in the industry.</p>
<p>However, there have been concerns regarding a lack of reconciliation between the removal of USDT from EEA traders and the information previously stated on the OKX website. Some speculate that this discrepancy indicates potential unpreparedness on the part of the exchange for the upcoming regulatory changes.</p>
<h2><strong>Regulatory Pressure Mounts: OKX USDT Trading Halt Signals EU Concerns</strong></h2>
<p>USDT is currently the largest stablecoin in terms of trading volume, serving as a vital infrastructure for crypto trading on centralized exchanges. The discontinuation of USDT trading pairs by OKX could foreshadow potential regulatory headwinds for the world&#8217;s most popular stablecoin within the EU.</p>
<p>As the MiCA framework is set to be implemented later this year, the EU&#8217;s dedication to increased supervision of cryptocurrencies is evident, raising questions about the future utility and popularity of digital assets in the region.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/SGg54CG0/" width="2475" /></p>

<p>In response to the regulatory changes in Europe, OKX has been expanding its global footprint and exploring new strategic approaches. Recently, the exchange launched OKX Argentina, introducing a crypto wallet and digital asset platform tailored to the region.</p>
<p>The expansion includes a peer-to-peer (P2P) network that enables customers to purchase cryptocurrencies directly from verified local sources. OKX&#8217;s user-centric approach and integration of popular local payment methods aim to accelerate adoption and address the specific needs of Argentine residents.</p>

<p>Hong Fang, the President of OKX, emphasized the significance of the expansion and its role in OKX&#8217;s regional growth strategy. By focusing on local requirements and providing Spanish-speaking support, OKX aims to facilitate crypto adoption in Argentina and establish itself as a key player in the market.</p>
<p>As OKX discontinues USDT trading pairs in Europe, other cryptocurrency exchanges are also expected to take similar steps towards regulatory compliance. The cryptocurrency industry as a whole appears to be shifting its focus towards adhering to financial regulations, reflecting a broader trend in the market.</p>
<p>The true impact of these regulatory actions on the crypto market will only become apparent over time, but OKX&#8217;s proactive measures indicate a growing emphasis on regulatory adherence and a changing landscape for digital assets in Europe.</p>

<title>Due To Ethereum Bias: Govt. Watchdog Sues SEC Over ‘ETH Gate’</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-watchdog-sues-sec-over-eth-gate/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-watchdog-sues-sec-over-eth-gate/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。Empower Oversight对证券交易委员会（SEC）提起诉讼，指控其未能遵守《信息自由法》的请求。调查SEC对加密货币（尤其是以太坊）监管的不一致性和透明度。'ETH Gate'争议涉及前SEC官员William Hinman和Jay Clayton的行动和言论。Empower Oversight的FOIA请求旨在揭露SEC与加密货币之间的潜在偏见和道德违规。SEC被指控拖延并未能进行搜索，导致多起诉讼。这些法律斗争可能对未来的监管政策产生重要影响。以太坊（ETH）目前交易在3376美元。 <div>
<p>Empower Oversight, a government watchdog organization, has <a href="https://empowr.us/empower-oversight-sues-sec-for-more-crypto-conflict-documents/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">filed</a> a lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), accusing the agency of failing to comply with a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. This request aimed to uncover potential conflicts of interest and biases within the SEC concerning its regulation of cryptocurrencies, particularly Ethereum.</p>
<h2>Investigation Into SEC&#8217;s Ethereum Dealings Continue</h2>
<p>The dealings, commonly referred to as &#8216;<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-army-clues-hinman-ethereum-free-pass-ripple/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">ETH Gate</a>,&#8217; highlight deepening concerns over the consistency and transparency of the SEC&#8217;s approach to digital asset regulation.In a public statement, Tristan Leavitt, President of Empower Oversight, criticized the SEC&#8217;s handling of their FOIA request:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>By slow walking their response to our FOIA request, the SEC is stonewalling Empower’s oversight into SEC officials with conflicts of interest on cryptocurrency issues. The public has a right to see all documents that relate to how these public officials violated ethics guidance and how the agency failed to hold them accountable.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The core of the &#8216;ETH Gate&#8217; controversy revolves around the actions and speeches of two key former SEC figures: William Hinman, the Director of the Division of Corporate Finance from May 2017 to December 2020, and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-spot-etf-inevitable/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Jay Clayton</a>, former SEC Chairman.</p>

<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-clo-demands-answers-from-sec/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Hinman&#8217;s June 14, 2018, speech</a>, where he publicly stated that Ethereum (ETH) was not considered a security by the SEC, has been a focal point of scrutiny. This position seemingly contradicted the SEC&#8217;s later aggressive stance against Ripple Labs&#8217; XRP, which the SEC classified as a security towards the end of Clayton&#8217;s tenure.</p>
<p>Empower Oversight&#8217;s FOIA requests, initiated in August 2021, sought to uncover the extent of potential biases and ethical violations within the SEC&#8217;s dealings with cryptocurrencies. The organization&#8217;s investigation was partly spurred by revelations about Hinman&#8217;s financial ties to his former employer, Simpson Thacher, which is known to have interests in promoting Ethereum.</p>
<p>These revelations raised questions about the impartiality of the SEC&#8217;s regulatory actions and the potential for conflicts of interest at the highest levels of the agency.</p>
<p>Despite the SEC&#8217;s initial agreement to search for relevant records based on terms provided by Empower Oversight, the agency has been accused of stalling and failing to conduct these searches, leading to multiple lawsuits aimed at compelling the SEC to release the requested documents. Empower Oversight&#8217;s persistent legal efforts have so far resulted in the SEC turning over 324 pages of documents following a lawsuit related to a December 2022 <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-sec-xrp-foia-request-jp-morgan-delayed/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">FOIA request</a>.</p>

<p>The latest lawsuit filed by Empower Oversight in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia seeks to enforce compliance with this December 2022 FOIA request. Leavitt&#8217;s communication on X (formerly Twitter) emphasizes the broader stakes of their campaign: &#8220;Empower Oversight has filed a new lawsuit against the SEC because of its refusal to comply with FOIA. #ethgate [&#8230;] So the fight continues for transparency, without which accountability is never possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8216;ETH Gate&#8217; not only exposes potential conflicts of interest and selective enforcement within the SEC but also raises significant questions about the agency&#8217;s regulatory framework and its impact on the crypto market. As this legal battle unfolds, it promises to provide critical insights into the SEC&#8217;s internal decision-making processes, potentially influencing future regulatory policies and the landscape of digital asset regulation.</p>
<p>At press time, Ethereum (ETH) traded at $3,376.</p>

<title>Debt Box Fallout: Judge Penalizes SEC For ‘Abuse Of Power’ Over Crypto Firm</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/debt-box-judge-penalizes-sec-for-abuse-of-power/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/debt-box-judge-penalizes-sec-for-abuse-of-power/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。一位联邦法官对美国证券交易委员会（SEC）在诉讼中对犹他州加密公司Debt Box进行处理的方式进行了尖锐的谴责。法官认为SEC在获取临时限制令时采取了“恶意行为”和“权力滥用”，并对他们加以制裁。这一裁决对加密交易所和SEC在加里·根斯勒主持下的执法记录都有重大影响。此外，裁决还引发了对SEC使用临时限制令的严重问题，并可能对其监管方法产生影响。最后，法官的裁决并不是针对Debt Box公司的有罪或无罪，诉讼仍在继续。 <div>
<p>In a scathing rebuke, a federal judge has sanctioned the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for its handling of a lawsuit against Utah-based crypto firm Debt Box. The case, which has become a lightning rod for the crypto industry, exposes the<a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/sec-blasted-by-judge-for-gross-abuse-of-power-in-crypto-case-1.2048545" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> SEC&#8217;s aggressive enforcement tactics</a> and raises questions about the agency&#8217;s use of legal tools.</p>

<p>The saga began in July 2023 when the SEC accused DEBT Box of defrauding investors out of nearly $50 million by selling unregistered securities in the form of &#8220;node licenses&#8221; for crypto mining.</p>
<p>In a dramatic move, the agency secured a temporary restraining order (TRO) freezing Debt Box&#8217;s assets. This extraordinary measure, typically used when a defendant poses a flight risk or could destroy evidence, was granted without notifying the company.</p>
<h2><strong>SEC Rebuked: Judge Ruling Favors Debt Box In Dispute Over Misrepresentation</strong></h2>
<p>However, Debt Box fiercely contested the SEC&#8217;s narrative. They claimed the agency misrepresented key facts to obtain the TRO, alleging the exchange was not aware of the investigation and had no intention of fleeing the country.</p>
<p><a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/c5bd0wqjc7v0/1u6cDaFa3REg8wHUc6onZ8/e1257f64a80ca440d887f67821f872fe/Debt_Box_Order.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Judge Robert Shelby</a>, after reviewing the evidence, agreed. In a December order, he slammed the SEC&#8217;s actions as &#8220;bad faith conduct&#8221; and a &#8220;gross abuse of power.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><img alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f6a8.png" style="height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://twitter.com/GaryGensler?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">@GaryGensler</a>’s SEC continues its losing streak in the courts.</p>
<p>A judge has ruled against the SEC in the DEBT Box case—imposing sanctions on the Commission for acting in bad faith.</p>
<p>This is one of the most alarming examples yet of Gensler’s abuse of power.</p>
<p>— Financial Services GOP (@FinancialCmte) <a href="https://twitter.com/FinancialCmte/status/1769855183352193081?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">March 18, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>The SEC initially admitted to mistakes and apologized for the &#8220;shortfall&#8221; in the case. However, they maintained their lawyers had not acted in bad faith and requested the judge waive sanctions.</p>
<p>This attempt at damage control proved futile. In a recent 80-page ruling, Judge Shelby not only sanctioned the SEC by requiring them to cover Debt Box&#8217;s legal fees related to the TRO, but also denied their motion to dismiss the lawsuit without prejudice.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/1u6hadqR/" width="2475" /></p>

<p>This decision has significant implications. Firstly, it&#8217;s a major victory for the crypto exchange and a blow to the SEC&#8217;s enforcement record under Chair Gary Gensler.</p>
<p>Critics, including a group of Republican senators, have long expressed concern about the agency&#8217;s zealous approach to regulating the crypto sector. This case provides concrete evidence that the SEC&#8217;s methods might be overly aggressive.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Federal Court Imposes Sanctions on SEC for Misconduct in Debt Box Lawsuit</p>
<p>In a significant turn of events, the United States District Court has imposed sanctions on the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for what has been described as a &#8220;gross abuse of power&#8221; in its…</p>

<p></p>
<p>Secondly, the ruling raises serious questions about the SEC&#8217;s use of TROs. Judge Shelby&#8217;s criticism highlights a potential for abuse.</p>
<h2><strong>DEBT Box Fallout Sends Ripple Effects Across Crypto Industry</strong></h2>
<p>The fallout extends beyond Debt Box. Leading crypto companies like Coinbase, currently embroiled in their own legal battles with the SEC, are watching closely.</p>
<p>This decision could embolden them to challenge the SEC&#8217;s tactics more aggressively. More broadly, it may lead to increased scrutiny of Gensler&#8217;s regulatory approach.</p>
<p>Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal tweeted:</p>
<blockquote>
&#8220;The Commission just foisted a bill onto every one of us for their litigation misconduct,&#8221; reflecting the industry&#8217;s concern and frustration.
</blockquote>
<p>However, it&#8217;s crucial to note that the judge&#8217;s ruling doesn&#8217;t rule on the firm&#8217;s guilt or innocence regarding the alleged fraud. The lawsuit will continue. Furthermore, the impact on other ongoing SEC cases against crypto firms remains to be seen.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Whale Abruptly Moves 16,003 BTC After 5+ Years Silence</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/1-5-billion-bitcoin-leaves-coinbase-bullish-signal/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/1-5-billion-bitcoin-leaves-coinbase-bullish-signal/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。一只比特币鲸鱼突然在网络上转移了约16,003 BTC，这些比特币在休眠了五年以上后才动用。交易数据表明这笔交易涉及到一些非常古老的硬币。交易涉及的地址从5年到7年闭塞的比特币数量很大，价值约10.8亿美元。分析师发现这次交易与Coinbase有关，可能是资金的输出。这一举动可能预示着一个大型实体可能正在进行一些新的买入，并将硬币移至可能的自管式存储。最新的比特币价格在67,000美元左右交易。 <div>
<p>On-chain data shows a Bitcoin whale has suddenly moved around 16,003 BTC on the chain after staying dormant for more than five years.</p>
<h2>A Large Amount Of Dormant Bitcoin Has Just Moved On The Network</h2>
<p>As CryptoQuant community manager Maartunn pointed out in a <a href="https://twitter.com/JA_Maartun/status/1769443343237283932" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, the Bitcoin blockchain has recently processed a transaction involving some very old coins.</p>
<p>The indicator of interest here is the &#8220;<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-giant-awakens-whale-1000-btc-years-slumber/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Spent Output Age Bands</a>&#8221; (SOAB), which keeps track of the total amount of Bitcoin the different age bands in the market are now transferring on the network.</p>

<p>The age bands here refer to groups of coins divided based on holding time. The 1 day to 1 week age band, for example, includes all tokens that have been dormant for at least a day and at most a week.</p>
<p>In the context of the current discussion, the 5-year to 7-year age band is relevant. Below is the chart showing the SOAB data for this particular cohort.</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin SOAB" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="2580" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GI5TN0lW4AAInKx?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096" width="4096" /></p>

<p>It would appear that 16,003 BTC belonging to this age range have just been moved on the network. This stack would be worth around $1.08 billion at the current exchange rate.</p>
<p>Given the massive scale of the transfer, it&#8217;s likely that a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-soars-past-67000-as-whale-population-grows/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">whale</a> entity is involved here. As for why this investor has decided to break their long silence, it can be complicated.</p>
<p>Maartunn has done some additional sleuthing to find out more about the transfer. It would seem that the profit-to-loss ratio of this transfer was 15, which is quite the amount.</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Whale Profit" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="2580" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GI5TyM-W0AAZXP3?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096" width="4096" /></p>

<p>As the chart shows, there have been other recent transfers of dormant coins holding a comparable profit ratio, which means that this latest transaction isn&#8217;t exactly unique. However, the scale of the movie certainly makes it stand out more.</p>
<p>The analyst has found that the transaction is related to a Coinbase move. Below is the Bitcoin <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bullish-exchange-netflow-negative-spike/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">netflow</a> data for the exchange, which provides hints about the direction of this transfer.</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Coinbase Netflow" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="2580" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GI5Vg3tXoAAJNkM?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096" width="4096" /></p>

<p>CryptoQuant&#8217;s netflow metric would suggest that the transaction was an outflow, as the indicator&#8217;s value had turned negative. However, Maartunn isn&#8217;t sure whether it&#8217;s an outflow, saying, &#8220;I need more time to conclude whether this is a real outflow &#8211; eventually ETF related &#8211; or it&#8217;s just an internal flow.&#8221;</p>

<p>If it is indeed an outflow, it could be a bullish sign for Bitcoin, as it suggests a large entity is potentially participating in some fresh buying and then taking the coins off into possible self-custody.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>Bitcoin has gone through some notable drawdown over the past week as its price is now trading around $67,000.</p>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的<br />本周最新的钓鱼诈骗事件导致了近300万美元的损失，钓鱼者冒充知名加密交易者Ansem，窃取了260万美元。钓鱼者在交易者的帖子下发布了总共超过3百万美元的欺诈链接，受害者包括不明身份的用户和知名项目。社交媒体上充斥着冒充重要人物的假账户，试图欺诈加密用户。最近，许多项目在预售中筹集了数百万美元，吸引了许多投资者寻求巨额利润，这导致了更多的钓鱼活动。加密领域的盗窃事件仍然在摇撼着市场，加密用户必须警惕他们点击的链接，并采取足够的安全措施来保护他们的资金。 <div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Another start of the week, another crypto scam alert. This week’s latest phishing scam opened Pandora’s box of scamming tactics after almost $3 million was stolen by an impersonator pretending to be a top crypto trader.</p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto Scams, A Tale As Old As Time</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Whether prices are up or down, scammers are on the lookout for their next <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/new-crypto-heist-alert-hacker-drains-5-6m-from-data-storage-platform-wallet/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">big heist</a>, and this market slowdown was no exception.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto detective ZachXBT informed about the latest scamming attack over the weekend. The investigator shared that an account pretending to be renowned crypto trader Ansem (@blknoiz06 on X) phished over $2.6 million.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">An account impersonating <a href="https://twitter.com/blknoiz06?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">@blknoiz06</a> phished &gt;$2.6M today just by replying to each of his posts taking advantage of the recent meme coin craze. </p>
<p>The largest single victim lost ~$1.2M.</p>

<p>&mdash; ZachXBT (@zachxbt) <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1769150002490638597?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">March 16, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Under the @blfnoiz06 username, the impersonating account replied to the trader’s X posts promoting a presale link that redirected users to a wallet drainer.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The scammer would announce under each post that he was about to &#8220;launch his token&#8221; $BULL, and the presale participants were required to send a minimum of 1 SOL and a maximum of 3 SOL.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Ironically, the scammer replied to one of Ansem’s posts where he stated, “I don’t launch coins bros.” As reported by the crypto detective, the largest victim lost $1.2 million worth of SOL. Hours after the report, an additional $250,000 had been stolen, raising the loot to almost $3 million.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Another ~$250K stolen since my post lol</p>
<p>&mdash; ZachXBT (@zachxbt) <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1769180302860046608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">March 17, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">When questioned whether these were real victims or scammers moving their stolen tokens around, ZachXBT confirmed that several victims, including the largest one, had messaged him to inform him of the scam.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Phishing In Troubled Waters</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Despite not being a new tactic, the number of phishing scams involving popular and influential actors in the crypto community appears to have increased recently.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Scrolling through social media, especially X, means seeing many accounts <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/deepfakes-use-buterins-image-in-sham-crypto-promo/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">pretending</a> to be important figures and trying to catch naive, greedy, or incautious users.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Web3 anti-scam platform Scam Sniffer urged its followers to stay vigilant after detecting several impersonators trying to prey on crypto users.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The array of personalities and projects being taken advantage of goes from virtual artists to L2 NFT-focused blockchains to liquid re-staking protocols, as reported by the anti-scam platform.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Scammers appear to be trying to take advantage of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-meme-shiba-inu-dogecoin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">memecoin frenzy</a> that’s taking place. Recently, many projects have raised millions in presales, and many investors are looking for their next big profit. As a result, phishing in troubled waters becomes an easy task.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As seen in the dramatic launch of the Solana-based memecoin Slerf, impersonators tried to take advantage of the situation. They created an account pretending to represent the team behind the project.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This launch saw the accidental burn of the Liquidity pool (LP) and Presale airdrop SLERF tokens, which resulted in the loss of over $10 million raised by presale participants.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="crypto scam, solana, bitcoin, slerf" class="size-large wp-image-288048 aligncenter" height="658" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Captura-de-Pantalla-2024-03-18-a-las-11.50.02-a.-m.jpg?w=601&#038;resize=601%2C658" width="601" /></p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Responding to the real account, the impersonator claimed the mistake was “a joke” and provided a fraudulent link for presale investors to “claim” their tokens.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">These tactics have made many affected figures limit the people who can reply to their posts and issue warnings about the scam. Similarly, others have <a href="https://twitter.com/Slerfsol/status/1769621998068535694" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">chosen</a> to end their posts with an image disclosing that any other information or link below doesn’t come from them.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It’s worth noting that crypto heists continue to shake the crypto space, with <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-hacks-value-saw-97-in-february-investigator/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">millions lost</a>. Due to this, crypto users must be wary of the links they engage with and ensure they have taken enough security measures to safeguard their funds.</p>

<title>Binance Investigates 300M BOME Token Pre-Listing Purchase In Insider Trading Scandal</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/binance-investigates-300m-bome-token-pre-listing/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/binance-investigates-300m-bome-token-pre-listing/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的<br />加密货币交易所币安对Solana Book Of Meme（BOME）上市涉及内幕交易的指控进行了调查。BOME的市值从零迅速上升到超过20亿美元，引发了社区指控内幕交易的讨论。币安迅速回应了指控，启动了内部调查。同时，OKX交易所丰富自身列表的方式与币安不同，强调他们独立做出上市决定。交易所币安的币安币（BNB）在过去24小时下跌4.8％，交易停留在543美元。 <div>
<p>Crypto exchange Binance has investigated allegations of insider trading concerning the listing of Solana <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-implements-stricter-token-listing-procedure/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">meme coin</a> Book Of Meme (BOME). </p>
<h2>Binance Investigates Insider Trading Claims</h2>
<p>On March 14th, Pepe Meme artist Darkfarms introduced the Solana meme coin BOME. He initiated the token&#8217;s presale by sharing a Solana address on Twitter, where raised SOL funds were utilized to add <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/nigeria-crackdown-binance-authorities-demand/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">liquidity</a>. </p>
<p>Within three days, BOME <a href="https://wublock.substack.com/p/talk-with-bome-investor-flynngao?r=jbpop&amp;triedRedirect=true" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">skyrocketed </a>from zero to a peak market value of over $2 billion (currently valued at $700 million) and secured a listing on the Binance exchange. </p>
<p>However, before the listing of the meme coin, a whale &#8211; a person or entity that holds a large amount of crypto &#8211; <a href="https://twitter.com/ChainROI/status/1769045094458331525" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">purchased </a>314 million BOME tokens for $2.3 million on the Raydium decentralized exchange (DEX) on March 15, at an average price of $0.0074 per token. </p>
<p>After the listing, the token&#8217;s value skyrocketed to $0.026, making the purchased tokens worth approximately $5 million. This suspicious transaction triggered community discussions, with some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/1bguk21/comment/kv9v4dt/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">speculating </a>about the possibility of insider trading. </p>

<p>Binance promptly responded to the allegations by launching an internal investigation into the insider trading claims linked to BOME&#8217;s listing on their exchange. </p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/binancezh/status/1769596302323798256?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">statement</a>, Binance addressed the community&#8217;s concerns, stating that it takes such information seriously and is committed to conducting a thorough investigation. The exchange&#8217;s preliminary findings indicate that the individual named in the allegations has no connection to Binance.</p>
<p>Moreover, Binance expressed gratitude for the community&#8217;s vigilance and emphasized the importance of transparency and fairness. The exchange promised to continue investigating the matter in-depth to uncover the truth surrounding the allegations. </p>
<p>To encourage reporting any instances of currency quotation corruption or insider misconduct involving Binance team members, the exchange offered <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/changpeng-zhao-ordered-to-surrender-passport/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">financial rewards</a> ranging from $100,000 to $5 million while ensuring the confidentiality of the whistleblower&#8217;s identity.</p>
<p>According to CoinGecko <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/book-of-meme" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">data</a>, the BOME token currently trades at $0.01114, marking a significant 51% decline from its listing price and all-time high (ATH) of $0.02689. Additionally, the trading volume has decreased by 35%.</p>
<h2>OKX Founder Responds To Speculations</h2>
<p>In contrast to Binance, the second-largest offshore exchange, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/okx-approved-a-win-for-singapores-crypto-ambitions/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">OKX</a>, has not listed any recent Solana meme coins. The founder of OKX, StarXu, has responded to speculations regarding this matter. </p>
<p>StarXu <a href="https://x.com/star_okx/status/1769733521793536340?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">clarified </a>that the OKX listing team&#8217;s primary focus is to discover valuable and promising utility tokens for their customers at an early stage. Unlike some exchanges, OKX does not entertain requests or pitches for listings. </p>
<p>Instead, the founder of OKX stated that they thoroughly researched potential projects in the market and closely monitored the performance of the tokens over a long period. Final listing decisions are made independently by OKX&#8217;s <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/okx-probe-south-korea-alleged-crypto-violations/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Listing Committee</a>.</p>

<p>StarXu emphasized that repeatedly promoting or pushing tokens to OKX team members on Twitter will not influence the listing process in any way. He urged individuals to refrain from such activities and stated that they have no influence on the selection of tokens for listing on the OKX exchange.</p>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。知名加密货币分析师Willy Woo对比特币的未来进行了深入分析，提出了对该资产与黄金和美元这样的传统资产进行投资的可行性。他对BTC投资的风险/回报比进行了研究，并表示比特币有望明显超过黄金。其分析提出了三种可能的估值情景：实现“超级比特币化”、与美元相匹配以及超越黄金。同时，BTC市场正面临美联储等宏观因素的影响，尤其是即将宣布的联邦公开市场委员会（FOMC）会议，可能对比特币价格产生显著影响。总体而言，尽管最近出现了差距，比特币仍然表现出韧性，维持在66000美元以上的水平。 <div>
<p>Renowned crypto analyst Willy Woo has recently <a href="https://x.com/woonomic/status/1769535005384912931?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">delved</a> into the future of Bitcoin, providing an analysis that explores the asset&#8217;s investment viability against traditional assets like gold and the US dollar.</p>
<p>With over a decade of experience in the market, Woo&#8217;s insights offer a dive into the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-shake-up-galaxy-ceo-novogratz-warns-btc/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">possibilities</a> for the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency.</p>

<h2>Exploring Bitcoin&#8217;s Potential Valuations</h2>
<p>Examining the risk/reward ratio of BTC investment, Woo presents an optimistic outlook, suggesting that Bitcoin holds a significant chance of outperforming gold.</p>
<p>His analysis outlines three scenarios for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-coinbase-premium-deep-red-reason-crash/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin&#8217;s future valuation</a>: achieving &#8220;hyperbitcoinization&#8221; with a coin value of $4.8 million, matching the US dollar at $1 million per BTC, and surpassing gold with a valuation of $690,000 per coin.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Today that bet is:</p>
<p>$4.8m &#8211; hyperbitcoinisation
$1m &#8211; matches USD size
$690k &#8211; displaces gold</p>
<p>The payoff is 10x &#8211; 70x, now make your own guess at chances of success and bet accordingly.</p>
<p>— Willy Woo (@woonomic) <a href="https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1769535009080148183?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">March 18, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Woo&#8217;s forecasts suggest that the prospect of earning returns ranging from 1,000% to 7,000% draws the interest of those looking for advice on investing in BTC. However, he cautions investors to judge the potential success of cryptocurrencies and tailor their investment approaches as needed. Specifically, Woo noted</p>
<blockquote><p>For example if you think there’s more than 10% chance of BTC superceding gold, then it’s probably worth investing to get the 10x.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Macro Influences And Bitcoin&#8217;s Current State</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market, especially BTC, is on the verge of finding itself at the mercy of broader <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/jim-bianco-backs-vanguard-on-bitcoin-etfs-decision/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">economic decisions</a>, such as the upcoming announcement by the US Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>Prominent Chinese crypto journalist Colin Wu highlights the anticipation of the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, which could significantly influence Bitcoin&#8217;s price movements.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The Federal Reserve FOMC will announce its interest rate decision on March 20 this week, and Chairman Powell will give a speech. Currently, CME shows that the probability of keeping interest rates unchanged is as high as 99%. In addition, Switzerland, Australia, the United…</p>
<p>— Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1769543035619250407?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">March 18, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>With expectations set on the Fed potentially maintaining interest rates, the decision could have far-reaching implications for BTC and the wider crypto market.</p>
<img alt="Bitcoin (BTC) price chart on TradingView" class="size-medium" height="1556" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/Eg8uvmHo/" width="2770" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite recent pullbacks that saw Bitcoin&#8217;s price decrease by nearly 10% over the past week, the cryptocurrency has shown resilience, maintaining its position above the $66,000 mark.</p>

<p>This recent dip, amid anticipation of the FOMC meeting and the upcoming BTC halving, illustrates the complex interplay between macroeconomic factors and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-hashrate-plunges-from-all-time-high-but-why/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">cryptocurrency valuations</a>.</p>

<title>Binance CEO Predicts Bitcoin Surging Beyond $80,000 Driven By ETF Inflows</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-surging-beyond-80000-driven-by-etf-inflows/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-surging-beyond-80000-driven-by-etf-inflows/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章首先介绍了比特币在过去5天内的波动情况，包括价格从历史最高点跌至更低水平，然后回升至68000美元以上。文章引用了Binance首席执行官Richard Teng的观点，表示比特币的价格将超过80000美元，归因于机构投资的增加。文章还提到了数字资产的大量流入，创下历史纪录，全球交易量达430亿美元，美国市场引领资金流入。总体来说，文章表明比特币和数字资产继续受到增长和投资者关注的推动。 <div>
<p>Over the past five days, Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency, has experienced a period of heightened volatility, triggering significant liquidations of leveraged positions as its price fluctuated wildly in hours. </p>
<p>After reaching an all-time high of $73,750 on Thursday, BTC experienced a<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-a-decades-long-investment-ceo-says-despite-recent-downturn/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> sharp decline </a>to $64,600 on Sunday. On Monday, at the start of the trading week, the cryptocurrency recaptured the $68,000 level. Nonetheless, it retraced over 2% shortly after, settling around the $66,800 mark.</p>
<p>Amidst this turbulent market activity, Binance Chief Executive Officer Richard Teng, as <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-17/binance-ceo-teng-sees-bitcoin-topping-80-000-on-etf-inflows" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reported </a>by Bloomberg, believes that Bitcoin&#8217;s record-breaking rally will persist, propelling its price beyond $80,000. </p>
<h2>Binance CEO Bullish On Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Teng attributes this expected surge to the increasing influx of institutional investment into the newly approved spot Bitcoin <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/jim-bianco-backs-vanguard-on-bitcoin-etfs-decision/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">exchange-traded funds</a> (ETFs), trading for just over two months. The introduction of Bitcoin ETFs in the United States earlier this year has attracted significant attention from institutional investors, resulting in new inflows.</p>

<p>Speaking at an event in Bangkok on Sunday, Teng stated that he originally estimated Bitcoin to hover around $80,000 by the end of the year. However, he now envisions the cryptocurrency surpassing that milestone due to reduced supply and sustained demand. </p>
<p>Teng emphasized that his forecast represents his viewpoint and acknowledged that the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-defi-tvl-rockets-80-impact-on-sol-price/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">rally </a>will not be linear. He believes the market&#8217;s ups and downs will ultimately benefit the entire ecosystem.</p>
<p>Lastly, Teng highlighted the continued inflow of funds into US spot Bitcoin ETFs since their approval in January. He expects more institutions and family offices to increase their allocations to Bitcoin ETFs shortly.</p>
<p>Richard Teng assumed the CEO role after Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) stepped down in November following Binance&#8217;s <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-ceo-to-step-down-4-billion-settlement/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">$4.3 billion settlement</a> with US authorities. </p>
<h2>Digital Asset Inflows Skyrocket </h2>
<p>In a recent blog <a href="https://blog.coinshares.com/volume-174-digital-asset-fund-flows-weekly-report-60801e380967" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, digital asset investment company CoinShares announced that digital asset investment products experienced a record weekly inflow, reaching $2.9 billion last week. </p>
<p>This surpasses the all-time high of $2.7 billion set the previous week. Furthermore, these inflows bring the year-to-date (YTD) total to an impressive $13.2 billion, surpassing the total inflows for all of 2021, which were $10.6 billion.</p>
<img alt="Bitcoin " class="size-large wp-image-288038" height="660" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot_79.jpg?w=669&#038;resize=669%2C660" width="669" />
<p>Trading volumes for the week amounted to $43 billion, matching the previous week&#8217;s record and accounting for 47% of the overall global Bitcoin volumes. </p>
<p>During this period, global exchange-traded products (ETPs) crossed the milestone of $100 billion for the first time. However, due to the<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/vanguard-ceo-double-down-on-anti-bitcoin-etf-stance/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> price correction</a> towards the end of the week, the total settled at $97 billion.</p>

<p>Regionally, the United States witnessed substantial inflows of $2.95 billion, while minor inflows were observed in Australia, Brazil, and Hong Kong, amounting to $5 million, $24 million, and $15 million, respectively. </p>
<p>Conversely, Canada, Germany, Sweden, and Switzerland experienced combined outflows of $78 million during the same week. On the other hand, the year has seen outflows of $685 million thus far.</p>
<p>Bitcoin dominated the inflows last week, securing $2.86 billion and accounting for 97% of all inflows year-to-date. Interestingly, short Bitcoin positions witnessed their largest inflows in a year, totaling $26 million, marking the fifth consecutive week of increased interest in this area.</p>

<p>She shared a screenshot outlining five essential aspects of meme coin investing, compiled by <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-team-1-2-million-burned/">Shiba Inu team member Da Vinci</a>. The first step of the guide highlighted the necessity of understanding the risks and high volatility characteristic of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/meme-coin-madness-sends-ethereum-fees-soaring/">meme coin market</a>, accentuating how these coins frequently undergo <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/can-doge-avoid-a-dive-sell-pressure-puts-memecoin-to-the-test/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">swift price fluctuations. </a></p>
<p>Lucie further disclosed how much meme coins were subservient to social media. According to the SHIB influencer, the price of meme coins is greatly influenced by intangible factors like <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/digitoads-races-towards-5-million-milestone-without-dogecoin-style-elon-musk-celebrity-endorsements/">celebrity endorsement</a> and social media trends. This highlights the possible absence of an intrinsic value in these coins, amplifying the potential for increased risks. </p>
<p>In stressing the dangers associated with <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solanas-biggest-memecoin-gains-681000-in-3-days-as-more-investors-bet-on-its-popularity/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">meme coin investments</a>, the Shiba Inu team has also provided important advice to investors looking into this market. They urge crypto enthusiasts to thoroughly understand the fundamental principles of a meme coin, along with its community dynamics and market trends, before making any investment decisions.</p>
<p>Further highlighting the need for risk mitigation, the team has stated the necessity of utilizing only expendable funds for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/top-meme-coin-to-surge-100x-post-bitcoin-halving/">meme coin</a> investments. They stressed the importance of responsible investing, urging investors to base their decisions on solid research rather than market hype. By adhering to these <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/guide-for-crypto-investors-7-memecoins-that-could-outperform-shiba-inu-in-2024/">guides</a>, investors may potentially avoid unnecessary risks in the market, while also optimizing their <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/3-meme-coins-you-should-have-in-your-portfolio-for-the-bull-run/">investment strategies</a>. </p>
<h2>Shiba Inu: More Than Just A Meme?</h2>
<p>Starting as a humorous project developed by an anonymous individual or group identified as “Ryoshi”, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-google-ai-price-shib/">SHIB</a> began its journey as a meme coin, distinguished by its speculative nature and comedic mascot inspired by the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/who-moved-1-trillion-shiba-inu-tokens-huge-transfer-raises-eyebrows/">Shiba Inu</a> dog breed. However, over the years, the cryptocurrency has been making serious efforts toward differentiating itself from others, adopting a unique three-token structure, cultivating a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bone-binance-shiba-inu-army-campaigns-for-listing/">vibrant community</a> and showcasing its versatile use cases.</p>

<p>In light of these developments, Lucie has <a href="https://x.com/lucieshib/status/1769577485123936423?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">boldly declared</a> in a recent X post, that SHIB has finally transcended the meme coin label. The Shiba Inu marketing influencer pointed out that the cryptocurrency has secured a position among the top 11 altcoins in the space, underscoring the token’s <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shibarium-new-record/">growing popularity</a> and possibly <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-price-0-0001-target/">promising trajectory</a>. </p>
<p>She has also expressed optimism concerning SHIB’s ability to evolve into a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/company/are-governance-tokens-the-future-of-defi/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">governance token</a>, potentially granting holders the opportunity to participate and vote on the decision-making processes of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-founder-end-vision/">Shiba Inu ecosystem.</a></p>

<title>FTX Bankruptcy Trade Turns Into Legal Showdown As Profits Soar By 200%</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-bankruptcy-trade-turns-into-legal-showdown/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-bankruptcy-trade-turns-into-legal-showdown/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> 摘要：<br /><br />这些信息是积极的。伦敦的破产资产交易公司Attestor Ltd.从FTX加密交易所购买的加密资产价值暴涨，获得了巨大的利润。然而，Attestor购买的FTX账户的卖家Lemma Technologies选择保留索赔，引发法律纠纷。Lemma的主要投资者Bang面临盗用数字资产的指控。此外，涉及Haru Invest的另一案件也牵涉到Bang。这些法律纠纷的解决将影响各方的未来。 <div>
<p>London-based boutique distressed asset trading firm Attestor Ltd. experienced a significant bonanza as the value of crypto assets purchased from <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftxs-sam-bankman-fried-should-receive-50-year-jail/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s</a> FTX crypto exchange soared. </p>
<p>According to a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-18/london-fund-s-ftx-bankruptcy-windfall-mired-in-legal-battle" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, Attestor&#8217;s trade became the talk of distressed investing circles as profits multiplied at an astonishing rate &#8211; 50%, 100%, and even close to 200%.</p>
<h2>Multi-Million-Dollar Gain From FTX Bankruptcy Threatened</h2>
<p>As the value of crypto assets rose sharply, Attestor and other market participants reportedly seized the opportunity to purchase distressed assets at “rock-bottom prices” from Bankman-Fried&#8217;s clients seeking to recover their losses. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-drops-bombshell-lawsuit/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">bankruptcy proceedings</a> of FTX, Bankman-Fried&#8217;s cryptocurrency exchange, are projected to deliver investors the full amount of their frozen funds, estimated at 100% of the initial investment.</p>
<p>However, Attestor&#8217;s hold on its share of the windfall has become uncertain. The seller of one of the largest FTX accounts purchased by Attestor, an allegedly &#8220;obscure&#8221; Panamanian company called Lemma Technologies, controlled by a South Korean trader, has opted to keep the claim to itself, at least for now.</p>

<p>Attestor&#8217;s legal team argues in a New York court that this situation demonstrates &#8220;seller&#8217;s remorse.&#8221; The price <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/blockfi-resolves-dispute-with-ftx-alameda-research/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">agreed upon with Lemma in June 2023</a> was $58 million, but the claim&#8217;s current value is expected to reach $165 million. </p>
<p>Lemma, the Panamanian firm, has yet to publicly explain its position or respond to Attestor&#8217;s lawsuit in New York. Attestor&#8217;s attorneys assert that Lemma will only honor the trade confirmations if compelled to do so by the force of law.</p>
<p>Adding to the intrigue is that Lemma&#8217;s main investor, Junho Bang, is facing legal charges in a separate case in Seoul, South Korea. </p>
<h2>Embezzlement Charges</h2>
<p>Attestor agreed with Lemma in June to purchase a bundle of FTX claims, believed to be among the largest. With this year&#8217;s <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/incarcerated-sam-bankman-fried-promote-solana/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">cryptocurrency recovery </a>and successful asset recovery efforts, these claims are now set to pay out in full. </p>
<p>The attestor is reportedly eager to close the deal and is willing to &#8220;complete the transactions immediately.&#8221; However, Lemma&#8217;s Junho Bang appears to be in no hurry to do so, possibly due to his involvement in the separate crypto-lender Haru Invest case, according to Bloomberg.</p>
<p>Bang stands accused of “embezzling” digital assets from the lender and is currently facing charges by South Korean authorities. Although the Haru Invest case and the Attestor&#8217;s lawsuit over FTX claims are distinct, Bang is central to both matters.</p>

<p>During the cryptocurrency boom, Haru Invest allegedly offered “high returns,” but it eventually froze<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-founder-sam-bankman-fried-in-the-spotlight/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> customer redemptions</a>, citing issues with its service provider, B&amp;S Holdings, which allegedly provided false information. B&amp;S described itself as a quantitative trading company for crypto assets, including FTX&#8217;s FTT token.</p>
<p>As the legal proceedings continue, the resolution of these cases will shape the outcomes for the involved parties and shed light on the future dynamics of distressed investing in the crypto space.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Analyst Targets $500,000 But Warns of “Scary” Dips</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-targets-500000-scary-dips/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-targets-500000-scary-dips/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。一位加密分析师认为，到2025年中旬，比特币将达到50万美元。尽管价格走势上涨，但分析师预计会出现一些“可怕”的跌幅。尽管比特币价格在周末出现震荡，但分析师建议投资者保持信心，认为比特币价格会随着时间推移上涨。此外，比特币ETF的需求不断增加，预计价格将因激增的需求而上涨。不过，分析师警告投资者在未来可能面临惊人的价格波动，但应保持冷静。比特币价格仍然看涨，尤其是在比特币减半奖励之前。 <div>
<p>In a post on X, one crypto analyst thinks Bitcoin will reach $500,000 by mid-2025. However, even as prices trend higher, the rally won&#8217;t be smooth sailing, expecting some &#8220;scary&#8221; dips. </p>
<h2>Bitcoin Is Shaky</h2>
<p>The <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/bitcoinmunger/status/1769441980113691023" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">analysis</a> is when Bitcoin prices appear shaky, characterized by sharp corrections. Over the weekend, prices plunged lower, denting confidence after a weak conclusion on Friday. Prices are yet to recover, trending below the psychological $70,000 level.</p>
<img alt="Bitcoin on track to $500,000 | Source: Analyst on X" class="size-full wp-image-287989" height="690" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GI5RmqaX0AAP8Ro.jpg?resize=1024%2C690" width="1024" />
<p>Even amid this, the analyst says people should hold on tightly, relaying confidence that the only way for the world&#8217;s most valuable coin is up. To support this outlook, the analyst compares Bitcoin&#8217;s price action and the historical trajectory of gold following the launch of Gold exchange-traded funds (ETF). </p>
<p>At current rates, and despite the lull over the weekend, Bitcoin is outpacing gold&#8217;s historical growth pattern. This preview suggests that, like gold, Bitcoin could rally over time. From this projection, the analyst thinks not only will bulls shake off the current weakness but see prices rally nearly 7X from current rates to $500,000, following a similar path to gold&#8217;s trajectory.</p>

<p>Still, while the $500,000 target is undoubtedly enticing, the analyst warns investors to brace themselves for &#8220;scary falls&#8221; along the way. These dips, the analyst emphasizes, shouldn&#8217;t be misconstrued as signs of the end. Instead, they should be seen as a natural part of Bitcoin&#8217;s historical price action.</p>
<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/x/BfxVsiD9/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Bitcoin price trending upward on the daily chart | Source: BTCUSDT on Binance, TradingView" class="size-full" height="904" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/BfxVsiD9/" width="1787" /></a>
<p>Despite the expected volatility, the analyst urges investors to &#8220;stay calm&#8221; now and in the future in the face of anticipated price drops. After sharp expansions over the past few trading weeks, there could be suggestions that the coin has peaked, and prices are likely to correct in the cool-off. </p>
<h2>Demand From Spot ETFs Ahead Of Halving</h2>
<p>Although it may be accurate, the rate at which Bitcoin ETF issuers purchase BTC for their clients is positive for the market. In a post on X, an analyst observes that the amount of spot Bitcoin ETF inflows within a month is comparable to a year of Gold ETF inflows. </p>
<p>This analysis suggests that the demand for BTC is way higher. Accordingly, prices may respond by rallying in the face of surging demand.</p>

<p>Bitcoin remains bullish, less than a month before the protocol halves <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-price-correct-after-halving/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">miner</a> rewards. Supporters are adamant that in the next epoch, considering the current level of demand, there will be a supply crisis. In that case, BTC prices might remain high.</p>

<title>US Treasury Approved Exchange Announces XRP Listing</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/us-treasury-exchange-xrp/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/us-treasury-exchange-xrp/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的<br />法官Analisa Torres判定XRP不属于证券后，XRP价格有望继续上涨。美国财政部批准的交易所Atlantis Exchange宣布将上市XRP。该交易所对XRP的快速跨境交易能力表示赞赏，并预测其价格可能会增长100倍。此外，XRP目前价格为$0.611，市值为$33.48亿，位列第6。交易所开放了XRP的存款和交易，但暂未集成原生区块链。 <div>
<p class="p2">The XRP price could be headed for greater heights with the latest development coming out of the community. While <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-scores-win-endorsed-as-non-security-status/">the altcoin</a> has been trading on leading crypto exchanges since Judge Analisa Torres’s rules that programmatic sales did not qualify as securities sale, it has moved a step forward with an announcement from an exchange approved by the United States Treasury Department.</p>
<h2 class="p2">XRP Debuts On US Treasury-Approved Exchange</h2>
<p class="p2">On Saturday, March 16, Atlantis Exchange <a href="https://x.com/Atlantis_Ex/status/1769207654365196413?s=20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> that it would be listing XRP for trading. This listing is significant to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-ceo-success-for-xrp/">the altcoin</a> because Atlantis Exchange is one of the few exchanges for trading cryptocurrencies that have been registered with not only the United States Treasury, but also the United Nations.</p>

<p class="p2">This listing puts XRP among around 50 cryptocurrencies which are currently trading on the platform. Deposits for users were opened on March 13, and trading on the platform officially began on Monday, March 17. Trading is also expecting to carry on for three days before users will be able to withdraw <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-analyst-bullish-on-ethereum-and-xrp/">XRP tokens</a> from the exchange, which will open on March 20.</p>
<p class="p2">Additionally, the network for depositing XRP to the crypto exchange is the BSC network. This means that users who want to send tokens to Atlantis need to make sure that they are actually using the BSC network to transfer the tokens. Otherwise, they could end up losing their coins. The crypto exchange is yet to integrate the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-advocate-goes-big-500000-pledged-for-senate-campaign-vs-us-senator/">XRP Ledger</a> on the platform, which means transactions cannot be carried out to and from the exchange using the native blockchain.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Nothing But Praise</h2>
<p class="p2">In the posts announcing the listing of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-price-to-hit-3-4-crypto-expert-reveals-when/">XRP token</a>, Atlantis Exchange also took time out to praise the cryptocurrency. The exchange outlines the fact that the token is used for cross-border transactions, highlighting its ability to confirm transactions in 3-5 seconds.</p>

<p class="p2">The exchange also sees a bright future for the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-etf-is-around-the-corner-uphold-research-chief/">XRP price</a>. In its post announcing the listing of XRP for trading, Atlantis Exchange predicted that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-price-to-hit-3-4-crypto-expert-reveals-when/">the altcoin’s price</a> could rise another 100x. Now, the feasibility of this is questionable, but it does show that Atlantis does believe that the altcoin will do well going forward.</p>
<p class="p2">As for the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-analyst-bullish-on-ethereum-and-xrp/">token&#8217;s price</a>, it is seeing a slow start to the week with light gains of 0.42% over the last day. However, its current trading value of $0.611 means that the coin is down 2.54% in the last week. Nevertheless, it remains the 6th-largest cryptocurrency in the space with a market cap of $33.48 billion.</p>

<title>Why Bitcoin Halving Could Bring Uncertainty To Mining Industry: An In-Depth Analysis</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/why-bitcoin-halving-could-bring-uncertainty-to-mining-industry/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/why-bitcoin-halving-could-bring-uncertainty-to-mining-industry/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要: 这些信息是积极的。文章讨论了即将到来的比特币减半事件对矿工收入和网络安全的影响。减半将导致收入减少50%，可能使一些操作不盈利。然而，价格上涨和交易费增加可能抵消收入减少，维持挖矿动力。此外，减少供应和增加需求可能有助于挖矿行业的发展。在挖矿技术创新和清洁能源的进一步利用下，操作成本可能会降低，环境可持续性可能会得到改善。最后，金融产品和机构投资能够稳定市场。 <div>
<p>As the countdown to the fourth Bitcoin halving approaches, scheduled around April 19th, 2024, miners are bracing for significant changes in their operations. The halving, which occurs approximately every four years, marks a pivotal event in Bitcoin&#8217;s economic landscape, impacting both miners&#8217; revenues and the network&#8217;s security.</p>
<p>Currently, miners receive 6.25 bitcoins as a reward for each validated block. However, with the upcoming halving, this reward will be slashed by half, dropping to 3.125 bitcoins per block. This abrupt reduction in revenue poses challenges for miners, particularly those operating on narrow profit margins.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.bitfinex.com/announcements/anatomy-of-the-halving-part-2-block-reward-and-network-security-navigating-the-new-economic-landscape/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">According to a report by cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex,</a> The halving&#8217;s immediate effect is a 50% decline in miners&#8217; income, which could render some operations unprofitable unless mitigated by an equivalent rise in Bitcoin&#8217;s price or reductions in operational costs. The subsequent strain might force less efficient miners out of the market, potentially contracting the network&#8217;s hashing power temporarily.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-287977" height="303" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_00544d.png?resize=542%2C303" width="542" /></p>
<h2><strong>Bitcoin Halving And The Challenge Of Network Security</strong></h2>
<p>Moreover, the reduced block reward raises concerns about Bitcoin&#8217;s network security and the potential for increased centralization of mining power. The network relies on decentralized miners to validate transactions and secure the blockchain.</p>
<blockquote>
“Centralization risks could mean the potential censorship of transactions and increased vulnerability to coordinated attacks or regulatory pressures,” Bitfinex said.
</blockquote>
<p>However, a decrease in rewards, without compensatory factors like increased Bitcoin prices or transaction fees, might disincentivize mining activities among smaller miners, leading to a consolidation of mining power among larger, more resourceful entities. This concentration of power could pose <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-halving-questioned-by-this-expert/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">risks to Bitcoin&#8217;s decentralized nature</a>, potentially enabling censorship of transactions and increasing vulnerability to coordinated attacks or regulatory pressures.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/AoJHf19j/" width="1835" /></p>

<p>Historically, halvings have spurred price rallies in Bitcoin due to increased scarcity. If this trend persists, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-50-drop-possible-ahead-of-halving/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">appreciating value of Bitcoin</a> could counterbalance reduced  block rewards, sustaining miner incentives and bolstering network security. However, this outcome hinges on several factors, including market demand and macroeconomic conditions.</p>
<p>Regulatory scrutiny adds another layer of complexity to the mining industry&#8217;s future. Governments worldwide, including the Biden administration in the US and various EU nations, are eyeing stricter regulations on Bitcoin mining due to environmental concerns.</p>
<h2><strong>Potential Outcomes And Strategies Post-Bitcoin Halving</strong></h2>
<p>The proposed Bitcoin mining energy tax in the US aims to generate substantial revenue, projected at nearly $10 billion in 2025 and over $42 billion in the next decade. If enacted, this tax could reshape the economic landscape for Bitcoin mining in the US, compelling industry players to adopt more energy-efficient technologies or relocate to less regulated jurisdictions.</p>

<p>Despite these challenges, there are potential beneficial outcomes for the mining industry after the bitcoin halving event. A significant<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-to-reach-100k-in-2024/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> price increase in Bitcoin,</a> driven by reduced supply and growing demand, could offset reduced block rewards, maintaining or even increasing mining profitability.</p>
<p>Continued innovation in mining technology, coupled with access to cheaper and cleaner energy sources, could lower operational costs and improve environmental sustainability.</p>
<p>Furthermore, expansion into new regions with abundant renewable energy could diversify industry risks and enhance resilience. Increased transaction fees, driven by higher demand and efficiency improvements, could also supplement miners&#8217; revenue.</p>
<p>Institutional investment and the development of innovative financial products could stabilize the market and further integrate Bitcoin into the global financial system.</p>

<title>Ex-Coinbase CTO Urges ‘Vote for Bitcoin’: Why It Matters</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/ex-coinbase-cto-vote-for-bitcoin/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章中主要要点包括：巴拉吉·斯里尼瓦桑在社交媒体上呼吁支持比特币；将比特币与美元的竞争视为全球意义重大的决定；强调比特币的透明性和抗干预性；对比特币市场的发展和投资前景进行观察；指出比特币对传统金融秩序的冲击；预测比特币引起地缘政治和社会变革可能引发的冲突。文章以比特币目前的交易价格为结尾。 <div>
<p>In a thought-provoking statement on X (formerly Twitter), Balaji Srinivasan, the former Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at Coinbase and a notable figure in the venture capital world through his tenure at Andreessen Horowitz, stirred the crypto community and beyond with a bold proclamation: &#8220;VOTE FOR BITCOIN.&#8221; Srinivasan, leveraging his considerable influence in the tech and crypto spheres, articulated a vision that extends beyond mere investment advice, framing the choice between BTC and the US dollar (USD) as a pivotal global referendum.</p>
<p>He argued, &#8220;The real election is BTC vs USD, the primaries have already started across the world, and every ballot counts. So make sure to vote early and often. [&#8230;] The USD/BTC exchange rate is the one financial indicator that DC can’t fake,&#8221; highlighting the intrinsic transparency and resistance to manipulation Bitcoin offers compared to traditional financial metrics vulnerable to distortion by central authorities like the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/us-crypto-industry-major-victory-federal-reserve/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Federal Reserve</a>.</p>

<p></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Vs. The US-Dollar: The Real Election</h2>
<p>Srinivasan&#8217;s assertion underscores a growing distrust in the mechanisms of traditional financial regulation and the authenticity of Bitcoin. He further emphasized the significance of recent legal and regulatory developments, particularly pointing to the August 29, 2023, ruling in the Grayscale case as a watershed moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Since they can&#8217;t fake the price of Bitcoin, the only thing the tradfi system could do is try to block the exit from dollars to Bitcoin. Which is why the SEC fought against ETF access for ten years. They finally lost on Aug 29, 2023 [&#8230;] this <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/breaking-grayscale-scores-victory-against-us-sec-spot-bitcoin-etf-imminent/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">court decision</a> is important because it opened the floodgates, allowing value to flow towards the Bitcoin ledger — and away from DC&#8217;s control,&#8221; he noted, suggesting the decision&#8217;s potential to catalyze a more widespread migration of value to BTC.</p>
<p>The conversation around Bitcoin&#8217;s resilience against governmental control is a central theme in Srinivasan&#8217;s discourse. He contends that BTC exists on a ledger beyond the federal government&#8217;s reach, making it inherently resistant to &#8220;freeze, seize, inflate, or confiscate&#8221; tactics that can be employed against more conventional assets. This characteristic of Bitcoin, according to Srinivasan, not only protects individual wealth but also signals a broader shift in how value is stored and exchanged.</p>
<p>Srinivasan&#8217;s insights extend to the investment landscape, where he claims, &#8220;Bitcoin&#8217;s incentives were strong enough to recruit not just <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-private-bitcoin-event/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">BlackRock</a>, but Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, and a critical mass of major firms.&#8221; This comment speaks to the BTC&#8217;s performance and its emerging role as a necessary component of diversified investment portfolios. He provocatively suggests that absence from the Bitcoin market might soon be seen as a strategic misstep, indicating the growing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies as legitimate assets.</p>

<p>Addressing the broader implications of BTC&#8217;s ascendancy, Srinivasan paints a vivid picture of a shifting economic order. &#8220;Its vertical rise signals that something is wrong in the legacy economy [&#8230;] telling you that the smart money no longer has full faith and confidence in fiat,&#8221; he asserts. This observation not only critiques the current state of traditional finance but also posits Bitcoin as a beacon of market sentiment, indicating broader economic trends and concerns.</p>
<p>Perhaps most compellingly, Srinivasan delves into the geopolitical and social dimensions of BGC&#8217;s rise. He foresees potential conflict as traditional power structures react to the decentralizing force of Bitcoin. &#8220;Just visualize&#8230;BLM/antifa/Hamas mobs&#8230;except this time with the support of blue-controlled police and military,&#8221; he speculates, drawing parallels between historical crackdowns on dissent and what he perceives as the inevitable backlash against Bitcoin&#8217;s disruption of established financial and political norms.</p>
<p>In concluding his thorough exposition, Srinivasan encapsulates the essence of his argument: &#8220;So: that&#8217;s why BTC vs USD is the real election.&#8221; This statement elevates the discourse surrounding BTC from technical and financial considerations to a philosophical and political declaration.</p>
<p>For Srinivasan, the choice between Bitcoin and traditional fiat currencies like the USD transcends conventional economic debates, embodying a critical juncture in the evolution of global finance and governance. Through his detailed and evocative commentary, Srinivasan not only champions Bitcoin as a superior asset but also as a symbol of a broader movement towards transparency, autonomy, and resistance against centralized control.</p>
<p>At press time, BTC traded at $67,464.</p>

<title>Is FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried Ditching Prison? Lawyers Reveal Daring Next Steps</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-prison-2/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-prison-2/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。文章揭示了前FTX交易所首席执行官Sam Bankman-Fried为避免监禁制定的计划，包括公开表明自己是共和党人，指责律师，发表强烈的反对币安的言论。检察官要求法院判处SBF 40至50年监禁，表示此处罚将反映出被告行为的严重性。辩护律师则提出将其判处5至6年半监禁，称外界会比监狱更需要他。司法部承认终身监禁对被告来说过于严厉，但也强调不要求法院判处终身监禁。 <div>
<p>A recent <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940.410.3_1.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">court filing</a> revealed plans that the former CEO of the defunct crypto exchange FTX, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-collapse-sam-bankman-fried-trial/">Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF)</a>, had drafted to ensure he avoids jail term. SBF, whose sentencing comes up on March 28, faces the possibility of spending up to 100 years locked behind bars. </p>
<h2>How Bankman-Fried Intended To Avoid Prison</h2>
<p>As part of his plans to avoid a jail term, Sam <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sam-bankman-fried-charges/">Bankman-Fried</a> included going on Tucker Carlson and coming out as a Republican. This formed part of what Sam Bankman-Fried had termed “probably bad ideas” in the Google doc, which contained a long list of things he planned to do to save face. </p>

<p>The FTX founder was publicly known to have made <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/breaking-news-ticker/ftxs-sbf-hit-with-fresh-batch-of-bank-fraud-charges/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">significant political donations</a> to the Democratic party while secretly funneling funds to the GOP. However, from his plan, SBF seemed to have believed that publicly coming out as a Republican would have helped his case more. He also planned to come out against the “woke agenda,” as Republicans are known to be conservatives. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, there were earlier reports that Bankman-Fried would blame all his lawyers as <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-execs/">part of his defense</a>. This was indeed true, as the convicted crypto founder contemplated this, highlighting in the Google doc how he would paint them as incompetent. SBF also planned to make everyone believe that this “cartel of lawyers” was why they failed in running FTX. </p>
<p>Bankman-Fried also thought putting out a “strong anti-Binance message” could help his case. The FTX founder may have indeed carried out this plan, as a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/is-sbf-behind-binance-negative-news/">Bitcoinist report</a> revealed how he might have been responsible for the negative news that gripped the largest crypto exchange last year. </p>
<h2>Prosecutors Ask For 40-50 Years For Sam Bankman-Fried</h2>
<p>As revealed in their <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940.410.0_2.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">sentencing submission</a>, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/us-government-bitcoin-holdings/">Department of Justice (DOJ)</a> has asked the court to sentence SBF to 40 to 50 years in prison, labeling it “necessary.” They noted that such punishment would reflect the seriousness of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-convicted/">Bankman-Fried’s crimes</a> and protect the public from further crimes of the defendant.  </p>

<p>The defendant’s lawyers had <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-fraud/#:~:text=Bankman%2DFried&#039;s%20Lawyers%20Propose%20A,six%20and%20a%20half%20years).">earlier proposed</a> a sentencing limit of 5 years to 6 and a half years, arguing that their client would be more useful in the outside world than in prison. However, the prosecution rebutted this submission and argued that such a sentence would be “woefully inadequate to satisfy the purposes of sentencing.”</p>
<p>Interestingly, the DOJ acknowledged that a life sentence for Sam Bankman-Fried would be “greater than necessary” to satisfy the sentencing guidelines, especially considering the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/prison-ftx-sam-bankman-fried/">defendant’s age</a>. As such, they emphasized that they weren’t asking the court to impose a life sentence. </p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章指出，中国的加密货币投资者在2023年度超越全球其他国家，实现了115亿美元的盈利。尽管中国政府对加密货币活动实施了严格限制，但中国投资者展现出了坚韧不拔的精神。美国在全球市场中占据主导地位，投资者获得94亿美元的收益。此外，亚洲地区继续在加密货币领域发挥重要作用，预示着数字资产类别前景光明。2024年的前几个月显示出了有望实现2021年高峰收益的趋势，尽管中国当局提醒投资者加密货币市场仍具有波动性和监管审查。 <div>
<p>Cryptocurrency investors in China have defied government restrictions to emerge as the<a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/cryptocurrency-gains-by-country-2023/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> fourth-largest earners</a> globally in 2023, according to a report by blockchain research firm Chainalysis.</p>
<p>Despite the government&#8217;s stringent stance on cryptocurrency-related activities, Chinese investors managed to accumulate an impressive $1.15 billion in gains, contributing to a total global crypto earnings of nearly $38 billion.</p>

<p>This resurgence marks a significant recovery from the previous year&#8217;s losses and underscores the enduring interest in virtual assets within China.</p>

<h2><strong>China&#8217;s Crypto Resilience</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3255699/chinas-cryptocurrency-investors-record-gains-more-us1-billion-2023-despite-sweeping-government-ban" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">China&#8217;s performance</a> in the cryptocurrency market stands out given the country&#8217;s strict regulations and bans on cryptocurrency trading and mining.</p>
<p>The success of Chinese crypto enthusiasts highlights a resilient and determined community that continues to find ways to engage in the digital asset space.</p>
<h2><strong>Global Market Trends</strong></h2>
<p>The overall cryptocurrency market experienced a rollercoaster ride in 2023, with earnings remaining steady throughout the year until a dip in August and September.</p>
<p>However, the market quickly rebounded, with November and December witnessing a surge in earnings that surpassed all previous months.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/SFF8tapd/" width="1835" /></p>

<strong>US Dominance And Hong Kong&#8217;s Market</strong>
<p>The United States maintained its dominance in the global cryptocurrency market, with American investors securing an estimated $9.4 billion in gains, far exceeding other countries.</p>
<p>In comparison, investors in the United Kingdom, the second-highest-earning nation, collectively made nearly $1.4 billion.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China, also saw a lively cryptocurrency market, with investors securing <a href="https://chinaeconomicreview.com/mainland-china-crypto-investors-made-1bn-in-2023-despite-ban/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">$250 million in gains.</a></p>

<strong>Asia&#8217;s Role And 2024 Outlook</strong>
<p>The continued strength of cryptocurrency adoption, particularly in Asia, signals a promising horizon for the digital asset class.</p>
<p>Despite regulatory challenges and market volatility, the early months of 2024 have shown promising trends that might herald gains comparable to the peak of 2021.</p>
<p>Major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have experienced notable price surges, with BTC even breaking its all-time high price record.</p>

<strong>Regulatory Caution</strong>
<p>Amidst the optimism, Chinese authorities have issued cautionary advice to investors, reminding them of the inherent risks associated with cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>This serves as a reminder that despite recent successes, the cryptocurrency market remains volatile and subject to regulatory scrutiny.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, BItcoin was <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">trading at $67,590,</a> down 2% and 5% in the daily and weekly timeframes, data by Coingecko shows.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Hashrate Plunges From All-Time High, But Why?</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-hashrate-plunges-from-all-time-high-but-why/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-hashrate-plunges-from-all-time-high-but-why/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。最近比特币挖矿算力急剧下降，导致了7天平均比特币挖矿算力的新高峰。这种下降可能是由于比特币价格下跌导致的挖矿收入下降，挖矿难度创新高以及即将到来的减半事件引起的。挖矿者可能会因此选择离开网络，以避免损失。当前比特币价格约为68000美元，过去一周下跌5%。 <div>
<p>On-chain data shows the Bitcoin mining hashrate has registered a plunge from the fresh all-time high (ATH) it had just recently set.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Mining Hashrate Has Dived Down Recently</h2>
<p>As the Bitcoin network works on the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-proof-of-work-fork-dates-unveiled/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">proof-of-work (PoW)</a> consensus mechanism, validators called miners have to compete with each other using computing power to get a chance to add the next block to the chain.</p>
<p>The total measure of this computing power that&#8217;s currently connected to the BTC blockchain is known as the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-hashrate-rebounds-smashes-all-time-high/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">&#8220;mining hashrate</a>.&#8221; This metric can directly correlate to the security of the network, since if a malicious entity has to succeed in an attack, it has to take over at least 51% of the total computing power.</p>

<p>Naturally, when the hashrate goes up, so does the resistance of the blockchain, as there is more machines to hack before the 51% target can be achieved. This is only, of course, given that the new hashrate being added is sufficiently decentralized.</p>
<p>Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 7-day average Bitcoin mining hashrate over the past year:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Bitcoin Mining Hashrate" class="alignnone wp-image-287897 size-large" height="411" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/chart_cab8de.png?resize=980%2C411" width="980" /></p>

<p>As displayed in the above graph, the 7-day average Bitcoin mining hashrate set a new ATH just a few days back. Since then, though, the indicator&#8217;s value has plunged down.</p>
<p>This decline would suggest that some miners have decided to disconnect from the blockchain. As for why this drop in the metric has occurred, there are likely to be a few reasons contributing to the trend.</p>
<p>The first and perhaps the most obvious is the fact that the Bitcoin price itself has plummeted from its latest high. Miners get their revenue from two sources, the block rewards and transaction fees, but the former is the one that makes up for the majority of their income.</p>
<p>The block rewards also happen to remain fixed in their BTC value, meaning that their USD value is really the only variable for the revenue of the miners as a whole. Obviously, when the asset&#8217;s price goes up, so does the value of these rewards.</p>
<p>With the recent price drop, the miner revenue has also tumbled in value. The miners who were already observing thin margins, like those situated in places with high electricity prices, may have decided it&#8217;s not worth staying connected to the network after the price drawdown.</p>
<p>At the same time as the crash has hit, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-mining-difficulty-soars-7-what-does-it-mean/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">mining difficulty</a> has also shot up to a new ATH. The difficulty is a feature of the Bitcoin network that controls how hard miners would find it to mine on the network.</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Difficulty" class="alignnone wp-image-287898 size-large aligncenter" height="413" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/chart_117c6b.png?resize=980%2C413" width="980" /></p>

<p>The concept of mining difficulty exists so as to ensure that miners can&#8217;t just add extra computing power to the chain to mine new blocks faster and receive new rewards faster.</p>
<p>The implication of the difficulty is that any new hashrate added to the network is essentially new competition for the existing hashrate, as they all compete for the same fixed BTC rewards. With the difficulty now at an ATH, miners&#8217; individual revenues would have naturally taken a hit.</p>

<p>Lastly, there is also the fact that the next halving, an event where BTC&#8217;s block rewards would be permanently slashed in half, is also due next month, which would drastically affect the miners&#8217; income.</p>
<p>Miners around the world would be coming up with strategies to deal with the halving and for some, it may even mean leaving the network behind, at least for now.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $68,000, down 5% over the past week.</p>

<title>Shiba Inu Burn Rate Sees Incredible 2,300% Increase In One Day – Details</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-burn-rate-2300/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-burn-rate-2300/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的<br />最近，Shiba Inu的销毁率激增，导致SHIB价格大幅反弹。在过去24小时内，Shibburn的数据显示，SHIB销毁数量增长了超过2300％，为195百万个SHIB代币。此举带来了SHIB价格的恢复，之前曾因一波利润回吐而受到打击。同时，Shibarium也似乎开启了其模因币季节，并可能对SHIB价格产生重要影响。Lucie还警告投资者谨慎投资模因币，并建议只用可承受损失的零花钱来投资。截至撰写时，SHIB的价格为$0.00002845，过去24小时涨幅达到了14%。 <div>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-burns-bright-shib/">Shiba Inu (SHIB) burns</a> are again the major talking point in the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/new-shiba-inu-ecosystem-token-march-7/">meme coin’s ecosystem </a>following a recent surge in the burn rate. This has also led to a massive rebound for SHIB’s price, which suffered a sharp correction in the past week due to a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-pepe-whales-sold/">wave of profit-taking</a>.</p>
<h2>Shiba Inu Burns Increase By Over 2,300%</h2>
<p>According to Shiba Inu’s burn tracker, Shibburn, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-8-billion-shib-burned/#:~:text=Over%208%20Billion%20Shiba%20Inu%20Burned%20In%20The%20Last%2024%20Hours&amp;text=As%20a%20result%20of%20this,transferred%20to%20a%20dead%20wallet." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">SHIB’s burn rate</a> increased by over 2,300% in the last 24 hours, with 195 million SHIB tokens burned during this period. This development has also provided a much-needed recovery to the meme coin’s price, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-whale-dumps-substantial-holdings-on-the-market-heres-how-much/#:~:text=Dogecoin%20Whale%20Offloads%2086%20Million,meme%20coin&#039;s%20recent%20price%20surge.">which declined by over 18%</a> last week. </p>

<p>SHIB has <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-shib-0-0008-ath/#:~:text=SHIB&#039;s%20all%2Dtime%20high%20(ATH,a%20new%20ATH%20very%20possible." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">been on the rise</a> in the past few weeks, even climbing to the number 10 spot of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-dogecoin-shib-excitement/">largest crypto tokens</a> by market cap. However, its run was halted last week by a wave of profit-taking from crypto whales who saw the meme coin’s recent price surge as an avenue to profit from their investment in the crypto token. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the recent increase in the burn rate and SHIB’s price reacting positively to it will undoubtedly excite the SHIB community, especially as the broader crypto market continues to lag. Shiba Inu’s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-lead-dev-shib-bull/">boldly claimed</a> that the meme coin would lead this bull market, and SHIB’s price recovering nicely after every dip can help strengthen that narrative. </p>
<h2>Shibarium Also Having Its Meme Season?</h2>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shib-2024/">Shiba Inu’s Marketing Lead, Lucie</a>, recently <a href="https://x.com/LucieSHIB/status/1769565972841607589?s=20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">hinted</a> at a meme coin season brewing on the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shibarium-public/">layer-2 network, Shibarium</a>. She added that the SHIB ecosystem has had success with memes, seeing how tokens like <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shibarium-shiba-inu-price/">SHIB, BONE, and LEASH</a> have experienced impressive growth since launching. </p>

<p>Shibarium&#8217;s meme coin season could be very significant for SHIB’s price in the short term, given the impact that Solana’s meme coin season has had on the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-price-2-year-high/">SOL token</a>. Shibarium seeing more traders invest in memes on the network would increase network activity and ultimately cause more SHIB tokens to be burned. <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bone-binance-shiba-inu-army-campaigns-for-listing/">BONE, Shibarium’s utility token</a>, will also benefit from such development. </p>
<p>Lucie was also quick to <a href="https://x.com/LucieSHIB/status/1769573220510814587?s=20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">warn</a> traders about the risk involved in investing in meme coins, noting that they shouldn’t be taken as “serious investments.” Therefore, she advised them against selling their investments to invest in memes. Instead, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-meme-coin-trader/">meme trading</a> should only be done with pocket money that one can afford to lose, Lucie added. </p>
<p>At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.00002845, up by 14% in the last 24 hours according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/shiba-inu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">data</a> from CoinMarketCap. </p>

<title>Weekly Crypto Preview: Major Events And Trends To Watch</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/weekly-crypto-preview-major-events-trends/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/weekly-crypto-preview-major-events-trends/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。<br />本周比特币和加密市场将受到几个关键事件的影响，如中央银行利率决定、Nvidia GTC会议和Etherfi的推出。中央银行利率决定可能影响比特币和其他加密货币，特别是美联储的决定。Nvidia GTC会议将提升几个以人工智能为重点的加密货币的地位，如NEAR和Render。此外，Etherfi推出ETHFI代币，通过液态重新抵押协议，用户可以在不锁定资产的情况下获得以太坊的利息奖励。 <div>
<p>This week in the Bitcoin and crypto markets is marked by several pivotal events that could significantly influence investor sentiment and market dynamics. Among them, central bank interest rate decisions, the Nvidia GTC conference, and the launch of Etherfi are particularly noteworthy. Below is an in-depth preview of these events and their potential impact on the crypto landscape.</p>
<h2>#1 FOMC Meeting Looming: How Will Bitcoin And Crypto React?</h2>
<p>Central banks representing nearly half of the global economy are slated to announce key interest rate decisions this week, affecting six of the ten most traded currencies. This series of decisions, the largest so far for 2024, includes announcements from the United States, Switzerland, Australia, the United Kingdom, Japan, among others.</p>
<img alt="Central bank decisions this week" class="size-full wp-image-287870" height="508" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GI4FCFCWwAAI3n4.png?resize=823%2C508" width="823" />
<p>These moves could indicate how central bankers perceive the current risk of inflation, with significant implications for the<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dollar-currency-index-dxy-crypto-bitcoin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> US dollar index (DXY)</a> and, inversely, for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The highlight of the week is the US Federal Reserve&#8217;s interest rate decision on Wednesday, March 20. Interest rates are expected to remain at their current level, with a 98% probability, as per the CME Fed Watch tool.</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs noted in a research <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeZaccardi/status/1769482598537904259" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">memo</a>, “Inflation has been firmer in recent months [&#8230;] We now expect 3 cuts in 2024, mainly because of the slightly higher inflation path [&#8230;] We suspect that the Fed leadership is also still targeting a first cut in June.” This narrative underscores a cautious approach to rate adjustments, reflecting a nuanced understanding of current economic indicators and their potential impact.</p>
<p>This upcoming FOMC meeting is particularly significant for the crypto market. Recently, the correlation between the Bitcoin and crypto market with the broader macroeconomic factors has strengthened, highlighted by Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies&#8217; price movements in reaction to<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-rockets-to-new-all-time-high-amid-cpi-surge-and-elon-musks-crypto-critique-of-dxy/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> hotter-than-expected US CPI and PPI data.</a> The anticipation of the “higher for longer” interest rates by the US Fed has led to market volatility, underscoring the importance of this week&#8217;s FOMC meeting for digital assets.</p>
<h2>#2 Nvidia GTC: NEAR, Render (RNDR) And AI Coins On The Rise</h2>
<p>The Nvidia GTC conference, a pivotal event for AI and GPU computing enthusiasts, is poised to elevate the profiles of several AI-focused cryptocurrencies. Notably, RNDR, NEAR, TAO, and FET have seen significant price movements in anticipation of the conference.</p>

<p><strong>NEAR In Focus: </strong>NEAR Protocol, a high-performance blockchain designed to provide the infrastructure for decentralized applications, has seen its native token NEAR surge by 125% in the last two weeks.</p>
<p>This uptick is largely attributed to the growing excitement over Nvidia&#8217;s annual conference, where Illia Polosukhin, co-founder and CEO of NEAR Protocol, is scheduled to appear on a panel titled &#8220;Transforming AI,&#8221; hosted by Nvidia&#8217;s founder and CEO, Jensen Huang.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Polosukhin&#8217;s participation is highly anticipated, as it could signal NEAR&#8217;s deeper foray into AI applications and potential collaborations with Nvidia. This has sparked significant interest in the NEAR token as investors and enthusiasts speculate on the future integrations and innovations that may arise from this intersection of blockchain and AI.</p>
<p>The upcoming release of Near Tasks, an AI facet of NEAR&#8217;s ecosystem, further fueled speculation about the protocol&#8217;s commitment to leveraging AI within its infrastructure. This move could potentially position NEAR as a key player in the emerging field of decentralized AI, offering scalable and efficient solutions for AI applications.</p>

<p><strong>Render Network Spotlight:</strong> Jules Urbach, founder of Render Network, is <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/render-founder-nvidias-gtc-in-4-days-rndr-surge-ahead/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">set to deliver</a> a highly anticipated talk at the Nvidia GTC conference. His presentation, titled &#8220;The Future of Rendering: Real-Time Ray Tracing, AI, Holographic Displays, and the Blockchain,&#8221; promises to offer insights into the future of digital content creation and the role of decentralized networks in supporting these advancements.</p>
<p>Urbach&#8217;s history of impactful presentations at GTC, including his collaboration with Nvidia&#8217;s Jensen Huang in 2013, suggests that this year&#8217;s talk could have significant implications for the Render Network and the broader ecosystem of GPU computing and AI.</p>
<p>“I think it will be one of my most relevant GTC talks, and a reflection of the next paradigm shift we are entering for distributed GPU systems, on par with the first one back in 2013 — when I took the stage with Jensen to announce Render’s centralized precursor (ORC) and then launched with AWS,” Urbach stated looking ahead</p>
<h2>#3 Etherfi Launch</h2>
<p>Etherfi, a leading liquid restaking protocol, is set to launch its ETHFI token today, March 18, marking a significant development in the DeFi space. The launch on Binance&#8217;s Launchpool will enable users to stake BNB or FDUSD tokens to farm ETHFI tokens, offering early access to rewards and project engagement.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Following a successful $23 million Series A funding round, EtherFi&#8217;s total value locked (TVL) has surged to $2.9 billion, according to DefiLlama <a href="https://defillama.com/protocol/ether.fi" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">data</a>. The protocol&#8217;s innovative approach to liquid restaking, allowing users to access Ethereum staking rewards and additional yields without locking up assets, underscores its potential to reshape the Ethereum and broader crypto ecosystem.</p>
<p>Users can stake their Ethereum directly through Etherfi and receive ETHFI tokens in return. These crypto tokens represent the staked Ethereum and accrue staking rewards over time. However, unlike traditional staking, ETHFI tokens can be used within the DeFi ecosystem, offering users the flexibility to participate in other yield-generating activities without sacrificing their staking rewards.</p>
<p>Etherfi leverages EigenLayer, a layer that builds on top of Ethereum, to enable additional yields on top of Ethereum staking rewards. This integration not only enhances the reward structure for stakers but also contributes to the security and scalability of the Ethereum network by leveraging EigenLayer&#8217;s functionalities.</p>

<title>Bitcoin ETF Debate: Jim Bianco Backs Vanguard As He Advocates Caution</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/jim-bianco-backs-vanguard-on-bitcoin-etfs-decision/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/jim-bianco-backs-vanguard-on-bitcoin-etfs-decision/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />文章讨论了SEC批准的加密货币交易所产品，以及Vanguard对比特币交易所产品的立场。Jim Bianco为Vanguard辩护，指出其在ETF市场中的成功表现。文章还提到Vanguard的CEO Tim Buckley表示公司不会投资比特币ETF，并解释该决定是基于公司的3000万基金持有者的意见，他们不感兴趣。文章最后澄清了Buckley是否离开Vanguard以及相关细节。Jim Bianco的论点从整体上凸显了Vanguard在ETF市场中的出色表现。 <div>
<p>The cryptocurrency market has witnessed a major turning point following the approval of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-markets-swell-in-2024-spotlight-bitcoin-etfs/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)</a> by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on January 11. However, despite its intriguing growth over time, several popular figures in the crypto landscape are still against the exchange products.</p>
<h2>Jim Biance Defends Vanguard&#8217;s Position Toward Bitcoin Spot ETFs</h2>
<p>President and founder of Bianco Research, Jim Bianco, has taken to the X platform to <a href="https://x.com/biancoresearch/status/1769386975851593875?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reveal</a> his insights regarding Vanguard&#8217;s stance against Bitcoin exchange-traded products while highlighting the company&#8217;s huge success without adopting the ETFs.</p>

<p>Bianco has highlighted several significant perspectives the community should consider regarding the subject. He believes that &#8220;Vanguard is the 850-pound gorilla&#8221; in the ETF market, while asset management firm &#8220;BlackRock is the 800-pound gorilla.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Jim, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-gobbles-up-nearly-196000-btc/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Blackrock</a>&#8216;s ETF assets were valued at $2.84 trillion as of March 15. Meanwhile, about $18.19 billion was invested in all of their ETFs in the past week, with $2.6 billion going into IBIT.</p>
<p>He further drew a comparison to Vanguard&#8217;s assets, which were valued at $2.58 trillion, amassing approximately $29.44 billion inflow into all their ETFs last week, with zero invested in Bitcoin ETFs. This information demonstrates Vanguard&#8217;s strong results in the larger ETF industry, which has made it one of the best-performing firms in the market over time.</p>
<p>Bianco&#8217;s insights came in light of the criticism from the crypto community after Vanguard&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Tim Buckley disclosed the company&#8217;s decision to not invest BTC ETFs.</p>
<p>In a video released by Vanguard, Tim Buckley stated that the firm &#8220;does not have plans to offer Bitcoin spot ETFs.&#8221; This is because it is not considered a &#8220;store of value&#8221; and does not belong in a &#8220;long-term portfolio.&#8221;</p>
<p>In spite of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cathie-wood-vanguards-stance-terrible/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">critiques</a> from the community, the CEO restated the firm&#8217;s viewpoint, which remained unaltered. He further declared that unless there was a &#8220;major shift in Bitcoin&#8217;s asset class,&#8221; Vanguard would continue to uphold its decision not to provide the products.</p>
<h2>A 30 Million Fundholders Decision</h2>
<p>Bianco also pointed out that the company&#8217;s decision was a result of 30 million fundholders &#8220;who are not interested in Bitcoin,&#8221; and Tim Buckley was just an &#8220;effective spokesman&#8221; for these fundholders.</p>
<p>He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Vanguard is not publicly owned. It is mutual, which means the fundholders own the company and Buckly is effectively the spokesman for these 30 million fundholders, who tell him they are not interested in BTC.</p></blockquote>
<p>These fundholders believe that Vanguard&#8217;s main focus should be on improving its customer service, not BTC because the firm has grown so &#8220;quickly and so successful.&#8221;</p>

<p>So far, Bianco has refuted claims within the crypto community about Buckley leaving Vanguard, stating that the CEO is retiring rather than being let go. &#8220;He is staying for another nine and half months as he is retiring at the end of the year,&#8221; he added.</p>

<title>Solana DeFi TVL Rockets 80%: Anticipating The Impact On SOL Price</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/solana-defi-tvl-rockets-80-impact-on-sol-price/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/solana-defi-tvl-rockets-80-impact-on-sol-price/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。Solana的DeFi活动激增，TVL达到38亿美元，交易量增长125%，超越以太坊。SOL币价上涨70%，市场乐观情绪高涨。分析指出OBV和CMF指标支持SOL继续上涨。Solana迅速发展的DeFi生态系统和网络活动使其在加密货币市场中成为令人瞩目的参与者。 <div>
<p>Solana, the blockchain network known for its speed and scalability, has witnessed an unprecedented surge in decentralized finance (DeFi) activity, propelling its native token, SOL, to new heights.</p>
<p>Not only has Solana&#8217;s DeFi total value locked (TVL) soared by over 80% in the past month, but its network activity has also surpassed that of Ethereum, further solidifying its position as a leading player in the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<h2><strong>Solana Shines With Soaring DeFi TVL </strong></h2>
<p>On the back of impressive growth,<a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Solana" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> Solana&#8217;s DeFi TVL</a> has reached its highest level in the last two years, currently standing at an impressive $3.8 billion, according to data from DefiLlama.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-287845" height="309" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_0cd344.png?resize=1024%2C309" width="1024" /></p>

<p>This surge in TVL can be attributed to a substantial uptick in trading volume on the DeFi protocols built on the altcoin&#8217;s Layer 1 network (L1). Since the beginning of the month, the daily trading volume on these protocols has experienced an astonishing 125% increase.</p>

<h2><strong>Altcoin&#8217;s Network Activity Up As Well</strong></h2>
<p>However, it is not just the DeFi metrics that showcase Solana&#8217;s remarkable performance. The network&#8217;s activity has recently surpassed that of Ethereum, the world&#8217;s leading blockchain platform.</p>
<p>Solana&#8217;s solid infrastructure and low transaction fees have attracted traders and investors seeking opportunities amidst a turbulent market. As a result, Solana&#8217;s total trading volume on March 16 exceeded Ethereum&#8217;s daily volume by more than $1.1 billion, reaching an impressive $3.52 billion, as reported by DefiLlama.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-287840" height="386" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_cd27e4.png?resize=956%2C386" width="956" /></p>

<p>The combination of Solana&#8217;s explosive DeFi growth and network activity has had a profound impact on the value of the<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/solana" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> SOL token.</a> Trading at $207 at the time of writing, SOL has experienced a remarkable 70% increase in value over the past month, defying the market&#8217;s downward trend.</p>
<p>While other cryptocurrencies grapple with price reversals, SOL continues to surge, buoyed by bullish sentiment and growing demand.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/7lHtcpS3/" width="2475" /></p>

<p>Analysts have pointed to key indicators, such as the On-Balance-Volume (OBV) and Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), which further validate SOL&#8217;s upward trajectory. The OBV, which tracks buying and selling pressure, has witnessed a steady uptrend, signaling a growth in buying momentum.</p>

<p>The CMF, measuring the flow of money in and out of an asset, confirms the increase in liquidity inflow into the SOL market. These indicators suggest a sustained positive sentiment surrounding SOL.</p>
<p>The remarkable growth of Solana&#8217;s DeFi ecosystem, coupled with its<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-network-forces-binance-to-halt-withdrawals/"> surge in network activity</a>, has positioned the blockchain as a formidable player in the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p>As the industry continues to evolve, Solana&#8217;s ability to attract DeFi participants, generate substantial revenue through network fees, and defy market trends bodes well for its future prospects.</p>

<title>Shiba Inu: Data Reveals Big Surge Edging Bitcoin, Ethereum Despite Setbacks</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-data-reveals-big-surge-edging-bitcoin/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-data-reveals-big-surge-edging-bitcoin/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章介绍了2024年热门的meme币市场，以及Shiba Inu（SHIB）在2024年悄悄夺得了风头。SHIB的价格大幅上涨，主要得益于在2022年推出的Ethereum Layer 2网络Shibarium的广泛采用。与此同时，比特币和以太坊虽然也有不错的增长，但在面对Shiba Inu的表现时显得较为谨慎。市场分析师预计SHIB还有进一步上涨的潜力，可能会达到更高的价位。文章中展示了这些市场趋势以及可能的未来发展。 <div>
<p>Move over, Bitcoin and Ethereum. The meme coin market is barking mad with Shiba Inu (SHIB) quietly stealing the show in 2024. While the big dogs have been grabbing headlines with new all-time highs, the self-proclaimed &#8220;Doge Killer&#8221; has been on a tear, outperforming its established rivals with a nearly 210% year-to-date (YTD) surge.</p>
<p>While Bitcoin and Ethereum have garnered significant attention for their price performance, Shiba Inu has quietly outpaced both, achieving impressive growth and capturing the interest of investors and analysts alike.</p>
<h2><strong>Shiba Inu&#8217;s Meteoric Rise: A Tale of Adoption And Innovation</strong></h2>
<p>Shiba Inu&#8217;s SHIB token has witnessed a staggering 246% price increase since the beginning of the year, reaching a peak of $0.00003599 before settling at a slightly lower but still remarkable price of $0.00002779. This unexpected surge has propelled Shiba Inu into the spotlight, raising questions about the factors behind its success.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-287810" height="384" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_ae9088.png?resize=635%2C384" width="635" /></p>

<p>At the time of writing, SHIB was trading at $0.000028,<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/shiba-inu" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> up 10% in the last 24 hours,</a> but shed 17% in the last seven days, data from Coingecko shows.</p>

<p>The key driver behind Shiba Inu&#8217;s remarkable performance lies in the burgeoning adoption and utilization of <a href="https://www.shibariumscan.io/stats" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Shibarium,</a> an Ethereum Layer 2 network introduced by the Shiba Inu ecosystem in August 2022. Shibarium has overcome initial challenges and gained significant traction, with major crypto platforms like Gate.io integrating the network.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-287802" height="210" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_353e12.png?resize=1024%2C210" width="1024" /></p>

<p>This integration has facilitated the processing of over 410 million transactions on Shibarium, demonstrating its robustness and efficiency compared to other Layer 2 solutions. The widespread adoption of Shibarium has fueled optimism among investors, contributing to the token&#8217;s price surge.</p>
<h2><strong>Bitcoin And Ethereum: Steady Growth Amidst The Shiba Inu Storm</strong></h2>
<p>While Shiba Inu has stolen the limelight, Bitcoin and Ethereum have also experienced substantial growth this year, albeit at a more measured pace. Bitcoin has breached its previous all-time high, reaching new price discovery territory as it surpassed multiple resistance points above $70,000. Despite setting new records, Bitcoin&#8217;s year-to-date (YTD) gain stands at a steady 65%, starting the year at $42 and currently trading at $68,049.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/z62Jr1HJ/" width="2475" /></p>
<p>Ethereum, on the other hand, has demonstrated impressive price performance, soaring above several resistance levels to trade at $3,840 at the time of writing. Beginning the year at $2,280, Ethereum has slightly outperformed Bitcoin with a YTD increase of 68.5%. While these gains are significant, they pale in comparison to Shiba Inu&#8217;s remarkable 246% surge.</p>

<strong>Potential For Further Growth: A Promising Horizon</strong>
<p>Despite its impressive rally, the memecoin is still 170% away from reclaiming its 2021 all-time high, while Bitcoin has already surpassed its previous peak. This discrepancy has led market analysts to anticipate even more substantial price surges for SHIB, as it suggests significant room for growth. As a result, price projections predicting rallies towards the $0.01 territory have emerged, further fueling investor excitement.</p>

<title>Cardano Founder Dispels FUD: Insights On Hydra, Scaling And Partnerships</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-founder-fud-hydra-scaling-partnerships/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-founder-fud-hydra-scaling-partnerships/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。查尔斯·霍金森在周末的一系列消息中解决了关于Cardano项目的各种关切和谣言，特别是关于Hydra的发展、伙伴关系和区块链的整体扩展策略。霍金森驳斥了有关Hydra项目被取消的传言，并提供了关于DIS合作伙伴关系、ERC20转换器等各种倡议的时间表。他还澄清了有关World Mobile合作伙伴关系以及伙伴链的误解。霍金森的讨论重新确认了Cardano团队对以安全和可持续的方式扩展网络的承诺，同时推动区块链技术潜力的边界。ADA目前在0.696美元交易。 <div>
<p>In a series of messages over the weekend, Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, addressed various concerns and rumors circulating about the project, specifically regarding the development of Hydra, partnerships, and the overall scaling strategy for the blockchain.</p>
<h2>Cardano Founder Debunks FUD</h2>
<p>Hoskinson <a href="https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">began</a> by addressing rumors that the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-founder-debunks-hydra-scaling-issues/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Hydra protocol</a> had been abandoned, labeling such claims as baseless fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). &#8220;I&#8217;m seeing some videos claiming that Hydra has been abandoned. It is just pure FUD. The team has never been more productive and motivated, there is great community engagement and new papers on the way for enhancements to the protocol,&#8221; Hoskinson stated. He directed those curious about the project to the official Hydra website for the latest information.</p>
<p>When confronted with a barrage of questions regarding the timeline for various initiatives such as the DISH partnership, the ERC20 converter, activities in Ethiopia, other <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-strengthen-its-ecosystem-africa-partnership/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">African ventures</a>, and a partnership in Mongolia, Hoskinson provided a comprehensive update.</p>

<p>He highlighted the successful deployment of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/game-on-cardano-erc-20-convertor-coming-soon-to-testnet/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">ERC20 converter</a>, which facilitated <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-backed-singularitynet-sets-in-switzerland/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">SingularityNET</a>&#8216;s transition to Cardano, making it a billion-dollar asset. Hoskinson further noted, “Our Africa work continues through John via the RealFi company, we successfully trained developers in Mongolia and concluded pilots with all the entities mentioned. Sorry, try again.”</p>
<p>Further addressing queries about scaling Cardano, Hoskinson encouraged viewers to watch a detailed video that outlines Cardano&#8217;s preparedness for scaling challenges in a decentralized, secure, and high-integrity manner. He underscored Cardano&#8217;s achievements, including over 2300 days of continuous operation, as evidence of the project&#8217;s resilience and commitment to its founding principles.</p>
<p>“Cardano is best positioned to meet these challenges in a decentralized, secure, and high integrity way. Never forget what we&#8217;ve accomplished together with over 2300+ days uptime 24/7 while maintaining our principles,” Hoskinson said.</p>
<h2>Clarifications On The World Mobile Partnership</h2>
<p>Regarding the skepticism and negativity directed towards Cardano, Hoskinson <a href="https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1769452455257845806" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">speculated</a>, &#8220;Man, it&#8217;s raining FUD this weekend, and I&#8217;m not sure about the origin. I guess it&#8217;s that time of the cycle where everyone freaks out about Cardano&#8217;s potential and roadmap, so they throw a wave of FUD at us.&#8221;</p>

<p>He provided insights into the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-africa-special-iog-partners-with-world-mobile-to-connect-250k-people/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">partnership with World Mobile</a>, emphasizing the project&#8217;s ambitious goals. &#8220;No current system in the entire blockchain ecosystem is capable or has technology to resolve a project at this scale involving billions of users. That&#8217;s why World Mobile is building it,&#8221; Hoskinson explained.</p>
<p>Clarifying misconceptions about partnerchains, Hoskinson emphasized that they are indeed part of Cardano, contrary to some community misunderstandings. Partnerchains are designed to allow for the development of hypercomplex projects with unique protocols, such as different consensus mechanisms, ledger rules, and transaction semantics. He pointed out that this flexibility is crucial for projects like World Mobile and decentralized social networks, aiming to connect the unconnected through a decentralized network with equal and fair rules.</p>
<p>Hoskinson&#8217;s discourse over the weekend provided not only rebuttals to the circulating FUD but also reaffirmed the strategic direction and robust foundation upon which Cardano is building its future. His statements reinforce the commitment of the Cardano team to scale the network securely and sustainably while pushing the boundaries of blockchain technology&#8217;s potential.</p>
<p>At press time, ADA traded at $0.696.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。加密货币市场目睹了Shiba Inu（SHIB）代币的巨额转移，令人震惊。1万亿SHIB代币（相当于2881.4万美元）被转移到了Gate.io这家主要的加密货币交易所。同时，Shiba Inu社区对即将到来的Shiba Eternity游戏的更新感到兴奋，计划在未来的季度进行游戏的Beta测试。尽管SHIB市场经历了一段动荡时期，但近一个月来一直表现出色，价格上涨了194%。然而，最近大量SHIB代币流入Gate.io给市场的稳定性带来了阴影，让SHIB社区感到不安。liquidation surge和game development的信息会加剧这种不确定性。 <div>
<p>Cryptocurrency markets witnessed seismic activity as Whale Alert, a leading service tracking large crypto transactions, reported a monumental transfer of Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens. A staggering 1 trillion SHIB, equivalent to $28,814,000, was observed in transit from an undisclosed wallet to the portals of Gate.io, a major cryptocurrency exchange.</p>

<p>The colossal transfer sent shockwaves through the crypto community, prompting intense speculation about its implications. While the sender&#8217;s identity remains a mystery, such massive movements to exchanges often signal imminent sales or significant trading activity. This revelation injected a surge of volatility into the SHIB market, leaving traders on edge.</p>

<h2><strong>Navigating Uncertainty Amid Liquidation Surge</strong></h2>
<p>As the SHIB market grappled with uncertainty, investors faced a tumultuous landscape of fluctuating prices and heightened liquidations. In the past 24 hours, SHIB experienced a <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/shiba-inu" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">significant downturn</a>, with prices plummeting by 14.27%.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/UuMIqmgN/" width="1835" /></p>

<p>Adding to market jitters, data from CoinGlass revealed a surge in liquidations totaling a staggering $5,280,000. Of this amount, $4,080,000 stemmed from long liquidations, while $1,200,000 resulted from short liquidations.</p>

<strong>Shiba Inu Shows Resilience</strong>
<p>Despite the recent dip, SHIB has demonstrated <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-active-addresses-soar-over-170/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">remarkable resilience</a> over the past month, boasting a staggering 194% increase following a substantial rally. However, the influx of SHIB tokens to Gate.io has cast a shadow of doubt over the market&#8217;s stability, leaving the SHIB community on edge.</p>

<title>Nigeria SEC To Hike VASP Registration Fees Under New Regime – Details</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/nigeria-sec-to-hike-vasp-registration-fees-under/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/nigeria-sec-to-hike-vasp-registration-fees-under/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。尼日利亚证券交易委员会提议提高虚拟资产服务提供商（VASP）寻求运营许可的注册费用。此外，其他规定的变化也包括加密行业的主要方面。VASP的注册费用将增加400％，最低实收资本要求也将提高。文章还谈到了尼日利亚与币安交易所的争议，以及加密市场的最新数据。 <div>
<p>Nigeria&#8217;s Securities and Exchange Commission has proposed to raise the registration fees for virtual asset service providers (VASP) seeking an operational license. This development is accompanied by other changes in the regulations governing the key aspects of the crypto industry in the West African country.</p>

<h2>VASP Registration Fees In Nigeria To Rise By 400%</h2>
<p>On March 15, the Nigerian SEC released a<a href="https://sec.gov.ng/proposed-major-amendment-to-the-rules-on-issuance-offering-platforms-and-custody-of-digital-assets-to-stakeholders-and-the-general-public/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> set of proposed amendments</a> to its Rules on Digital Assets Issuance, Offering Platforms, Exchange, and Custody. According to the securities regulator, the suggested changes are aimed at providing more regulatory clarity to a rapidly developing crypto market as well as implementing feedback from industry players following recent discussions with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). </p>
<p>Of all the updated regulations, a quintupling increase in VASP registration fees from 30 million ($18,841.75) to 150 million ($94,208.76) has been a major talking point as such policies are usually viewed as a means of discouraging business participation, in this case, the emergence of new crypto exchanges. Meanwhile, it could also function as a protective mechanism, thus ensuring that only sturdy and well-funded parties are able to operate as VASPs.</p>
<p>Furthermore, crypto exchanges and trading platforms would now be expected to pay an application fee and processing fee of 300,000 naira ($188.42) and 1,000,000 naira ($628.06) as opposed to previous values of 100,000 ($62.81) and 300,000 ($188.42) respectively. </p>
<p>In addition, the country&#8217;s regulator has also raised the minimum paid-up capital for these businesses to 1,000,000,000 naira ($628,058.40) which must be set in bank balances, fixed assets, or as an investment in certain securities. Meanwhile, there will be a fidelity bond covering up to 25% of this minimum paid-up capital in line with the Commission’s existing rules and regulations. </p>

<h2>The Nigerian Crypto Space And Its Troubles</h2>
<p>Lately, Nigeria has been among major crypto headlines due to an ongoing squabble with prominent crypto exchange Binance. The government of the West African nation has accused Binance of playing a significant role in the devaluation of Nigerian Naira, demanding compensation to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/nigeria-fines-binance-10-billion/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">the tune of $10 billion. </a></p>
<p>This accusation has been accompanied by the Nigerian government making other demands of Binance in terms of user data and reportedly<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/nigeria-detains-binances-crypto-crime-investigator/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> detaining two of the exchange’s top executives</a>. In response, Binance <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-suspends-all-operations-in-nigeria/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">has shut down all Nigerian Naira (NGN) services</a> as well as delisted Naira trading pairs on its platform. However, there are still no indications the exchange will pull out of the African nation. </p>
<p>At the time of writing, the total crypto market cap is valued at $2.52 trillion, following a 4.23% decline in the last day. Meanwhile, Bitcoin, the market leader, now trades at $66,275.63 due to an ongoing price correction.</p>

<title>Shibarium Breaks The Internet (Again) With Over 400 Million Layer-2 Transactions</title>

<div> <br /><br />摘要: 这些信息是积极的<br />
SHIB的Layer-2区块链Shibarium达到了惊人的交易吞吐量里程碑，表现出了平台的稳定性和潜力。其与K9 Finance的战略合作有助于拓展生态系统，推动创新。尽管SHIB价格受到市场波动的影响，但SHIB的发展努力受到认可，被列入福布斯投资加密货币前十名，并受到金融节目《关注你的金钱》的关注。 <div>
<p>Shibarium, the Layer-2 blockchain developed by the creative minds behind Shiba Inu (SHIB), has shattered expectations by reaching an extraordinary milestone in transaction throughput. Surpassing an impressive<a href="https://www.shibariumscan.io/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> 411 million transactions,</a>   Shibariumscan has revealed the platform&#8217;s resilience in the face of market volatility.</p>

<p>The recent surge in user adoption and the influx of dApp builders have contributed to Shibarium&#8217;s exponential growth. Over the past few days alone, more than 3 million transfers have been added, solidifying Shibarium&#8217;s position as a force to be reckoned with in the blockchain space.</p>
<p>This achievement is particularly impressive given the current daily transaction throughput of 1.03 million, which, although lower than its peak of 4.2 million transfers per day on February 20, reflects the platform&#8217;s stability and potential for further expansion.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-287675" height="222" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_e0e426.png?resize=1024%2C222" width="1024" /></p>

<h2><strong>Shibarium Forges Strategic Partnership, Expanding Its Ecosystem</strong></h2>
<p>In a move to fortify its ecosystem and foster innovation, Shibarium has recently formed a strategic partnership with K9 Finance, a prominent player in the financial technology industry.</p>
<p>This collaboration marks a significant milestone for both parties, as K9 Finance launches its native coin, KNINE, on the Shibarium platform. As a testament to their commitment, Shytoshi Kusama, the visionary leader behind SHIB, and Kaal Dhairya, the brilliant SHIB lead developer, have been appointed as official advisors to K9 Finance.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-partner-token-featured-on-us-tv-station/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">partnership between Shibarium and K9 Finance</a> showcases the platform&#8217;s dedication to fostering collaborations that drive growth and fuel its mission to revolutionize the blockchain landscape. This strategic alliance will undoubtedly open doors to new possibilities, leading to enhanced user experiences and the creation of innovative decentralized applications.</p>
<h2><strong>SHIB Navigates Challenging Waters Amidst Market Turbulence</strong></h2>
<p>While Shibarium celebrates its record-breaking achievements, the price of<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-active-addresses-soar-over-170/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> Shiba Inu</a> (SHIB), the second-largest meme cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has experienced a turbulent ride in recent days.</p>
<p>Exhibiting a correlation with the price movements of Bitcoin (BTC), SHIB has encountered a 28% decrease in value following Bitcoin&#8217;s correction from its all-time high of $73,750.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/KHvF4SWB/" width="1835" /></p>

<p>Investors may find these price fluctuations discouraging, but it is crucial to consider the broader context of SHIB&#8217;s ongoing development efforts. Notably, SHIB received recognition and was featured on Forbes&#8217; prestigious top 10 list of cryptocurrencies to invest in.</p>

<p>Additionally, the cryptocurrency garnered attention on the popular financial program &#8220;Eye on Your Money,&#8221; where it was mentioned alongside Bitcoin. While these accolades did not result in immediate price surges, they reinforce SHIB&#8217;s potential and the significance of its long-term growth prospects.</p>

<title>Crypto Analyst Sets $5 Target For Cardano Price – Here’s How</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-analyst-sets-5-target-for-cardano-price-how/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-analyst-sets-5-target-for-cardano-price-how/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />ADA过去一周经历了波动，价格一度上涨至多月高点，但随后暴跌18%。一位知名分析师预测，ADA价格将在未来几个月中涨幅高达670%。当前ADA价格为0.6626美元，市值超过230亿美元。分析师认为ADA价格将在0.55美元和0.80美元之间水平震荡，然后迅速上涨至1.70美元，为未来的5美元突破铺平道路。ADA仍然是前十大加密货币之一。 <div>
<p class="p1">The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-king-of-dead-coins/">price action of Cardano</a> (ADA) over the past week is a story of two halves, with the token notching a new multi-month high early in the week only to crash by over 18% a few days afterward. This recent decline in ADA price reflects a broader bearish climate in the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p class="p1">Interestingly, a renowned crypto analyst on the X platform has put forward an exciting projection for the price of Cardano over the coming months. This latest price analysis suggests that this latest price downturn will be short-lived, with a bullish future on the horizon.</p>
<h2 class="p1">Analyst Predicts Cardano Price To Surge By 670%</h2>
<p class="p1">Popular crypto analyst <a href="https://x.com/ali_charts/status/1769096425407721629?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Ali Martinez took to X</a> to share his latest prognosis on the price of the Cardano token. According to the expert, the cryptocurrency’s current price action seems to be mirroring a pattern from 2018 to 2021.</p>
<p><img alt="Cardano" class="aligncenter wp-image-287623 size-large" height="660" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GI0X0dcXgAAw0Pf.jpeg?resize=955%2C660" width="955" /></p>

<p class="p1">From the highlighted weekly chart, the ADA price only recently broke out of a consolidation zone, which looks like a replica of the 2018 &#8211; 2020 consolidation range. Having retested the upper boundary of the range, the token looks set for a price upswing.</p>

<p class="p1">However, Martinez expects the Cardano price to move horizontally between $0.55 and $0.80 over the coming weeks. This period of sluggish activity will then be followed by a rapid price upswing to $1.70, according to the analyst.</p>
<p class="p1">In his post, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-doge-trading-volume/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Martinez</a> mentioned the possibility of a period of further price consolidation after the over 160% surge to $1.70. This is expected to “set the stage for a breakout to $5” for the Cardano price</p>
<p class="p1">This audacious projection represents an almost 700% surge for the ADA token from the current price point. From the highlighted chart, these bullish moves are expected to occur over the next few months in 2024.</p>
<h2 class="p1">ADA Price Overview</h2>
<p class="p1">As of this writing, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-network-sees-massive-growth-in-new-wallets/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Cardano token</a> is valued at $0.6626, reflecting a steep 8.3% decline in the past 24 hours. The altcoin, like the general market, has been experiencing a significant amount of bearish pressure over the past few days.</p>

<p class="p1">This dip comes barely three days after <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/analyst-predicts-cardano-price-to-skyrocket-by-1400/">ADA’s price</a> hit $0.8, its highest level in nearly two years. According to data from CoinGecko, the value of cryptocurrency has dropped by more than 18% since then, with a 12% decline in its weekly timeframe.</p>
<p class="p1">Nevertheless, the Cardano token still ranks as one of the ten largest cryptocurrencies in the sector, with a market capitalization of over $23 billion.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要: 这些信息是积极的。<br />约翰·迪顿是一位著名律师和XRP支持者，决定挑战麻省现任参议员伊丽莎白·沃伦，他投入了50万美元的资金进入参议员竞选。他得到了加密社区的支持，包括卡尔达诺创始人查尔斯·霍金森。迪顿对胜选充满信心，认为沃伦容易受到挑战。他利用社交媒体筹集资金，主张自由和加密立场。迪顿的挑战已经引起了媒体的关注，他的竞选策略强调反对传统政治。<br /> <div>
<p>In a bold move, prominent lawyer and XRP proponent John Deaton has made a substantial $500,000 donation to his Senate campaign against incumbent US senator for Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren.</p>
<p>Deaton is presenting a Republican challenge to senator Warren, giving the prominent progressive her first serious, albeit still remote, opponent and setting up an election-season dispute over cryptocurrencies.</p>

<h2><strong>Deaton&#8217;s Campaign Gains Momentum With Crypto Community Support</strong></h2>
<p>Deaton&#8217;s announcement has ignited a surge of support from the crypto community, with many prominent figures expressing their endorsement and willingness to contribute to his campaign.</p>
<p>Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson was among the first to step forward, donating the maximum allowable amount of $3,300. <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/elizabeth-warren-rallies-donors-marine-veteran-crypto-attorney-john-deaton-announces-senate-challenge" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Deaton&#8217;s campaign</a> has also embraced crypto donations, allowing supporters to contribute using various cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>— John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1768759999533334680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">March 15, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<h2><strong>Deaton Confident In Victory, Cites Warren&#8217;s Vulnerabilities</strong></h2>
<p>Despite Warren&#8217;s long-standing presence in Massachusetts politics, Deaton exudes confidence in his ability to secure victory in the upcoming election.</p>
<p>He highlights several factors that indicate Warren&#8217;s vulnerability, including her low favorability ratings and the fact that a significant portion of eligible voters in Massachusetts are neither Democrats nor Republicans.</p>
<p>Deaton believes these factors, coupled with his strong support from the crypto community, give him a fighting chance to unseat the incumbent senator.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/uB97CnpQ/" width="1835" /></p>

<strong>XRP Community Speculates On Deaton&#8217;s Potential Impact On Crypto Regulation</strong>
<p>While Deaton&#8217;s campaign primarily focuses on challenging Warren&#8217;s anti-crypto stance, the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">XRP</a> community is abuzz with speculation about the potential implications of his victory for the ongoing Ripple lawsuit.</p>
<p>Deaton&#8217;s extensive legal experience and vocal support for the crypto industry have led many to believe that his election could positively influence the outcome of the case.</p>
<p>However, it remains uncertain whether Deaton&#8217;s involvement in the Senate race will directly impact the Ripple lawsuit.</p>

<strong>Deaton&#8217;s Fundraising Efforts And Campaign Strategy</strong>
<p>To bolster his campaign&#8217;s financial resources, Deaton has set an ambitious goal of raising $1 million by March 31st. He has turned to his substantial social media following, primarily crypto enthusiasts, to contribute to the cause.</p>
<p>Deaton&#8217;s campaign strategy emphasizes the importance of freedom and the need for nonpartisan leadership in Washington that represents the interests of ordinary citizens.</p>
<p>He believes that his outsider status and willingness to challenge the status quo resonate with voters disillusioned with traditional politics.</p>
<strong>Media Attention And Recognition Of Deaton&#8217;s Challenge</strong>
<p>Deaton&#8217;s candidacy has garnered significant media attention, with outlets such as Fox Business recognizing him as a major challenger who poses a genuine threat to Warren&#8217;s re-election bid.</p>
<p>His campaign has successfully captured the public&#8217;s imagination, and his message of freedom and crypto advocacy has struck a chord with many voters.</p>
<p>As the race heats up, it remains to be seen whether Deaton&#8217;s grassroots campaign can overcome the challenges posed by Warren&#8217;s incumbency and political establishment support.</p>
