<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br><br>摘要：这些信息是消极的。文章指出，如果牛市未能夺回70,300美元的支撑位置，比特币可能会下跌至59,000至62,000美元支撑区，这将导致价格从73,800美元的历史最高水平下跌20%。文章还提到了存在的并且有效的熊市分歧形态，并且强调了即将召开的美联储公开市场委员会（FOMC）会议对比特币价格的关键影响。此外，Grayscale出售更多比特币，现货ETF需求减弱，这可能对比特币产生负面影响。 <div>
<p>One analyst on X now thinks there is a high chance that Bitcoin will drop from spot levels to as low as the $59,000 to $62,000 support zone if bulls fail to reclaim $70,300. The drop will represent a 20% drop from all-time highs of $73,800.</p>
<h2>Eyes On FOMC After BoJ Shocker</h2>
<p>The analyst <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1769996367521353898" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">noted</a> a &#8220;valid&#8221; bearish divergence formation in the Bitcoin daily chart. Whenever a divergence forms, it means that there is a disconnect between price and momentum. With bears currently in command, forcing prices lower, the odds of prices falling even lower beyond the current lows appear elevated. </p>
<img alt="Bitcoin price trading below $70,300 | Source: Analyst on X" class="size-full wp-image-288227" height="548" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GJBKUGCXAAAPauH.png?resize=1024%2C548" width="1024" />
<p>For the ongoing uptrend to persist and for bulls to breathe a sigh of relief, a robust close above $70,300 is necessary. This potential upswing could decelerate the current sell-off and align prices with the dominant trend over the past few months. </p>
<p>The trader&#8217;s evaluation indicates that several fundamental factors will shape the short-to-medium-term price trajectory. The most significant of these is the anticipated direction of monetary policy from the imminent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in the United States on [March 20], which could substantially impact Bitcoin&#8217;s price. </p>

<p>Ahead of this meeting, the Bank of Japan (BoJ), the central bank of Japan, raised interest rates for the first time since 2007, sending shockwaves across the market. That the BoJ is raising rates means the global financial conditions, despite optimism, are still tight. Of note, inflation in the country rose. However, the central bank said they plan to keep interest rates at the current levels as long as &#8220;financial conditions&#8221; remain constant.</p>
<h2>Grayscale Selling More Bitcoin, Spot ETF Demand Waning?</h2>
<p>Aside from monetary policy, analysts highlight that recent outflows from Grayscale, amounting to approximately $154 million on March 18, resulted in a total outflow for the first time since March 1. Data from Lookonchain <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1769791163983167603" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">indicates</a> that Grayscale, winding down its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), released more coins than other spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuers purchased. </p>
<img alt="Grayscale unloading BTC | Source: Lookonchain via X" class="size-full wp-image-288226" height="768" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GI-Pn-agAEP5aS.png?resize=1024%2C768" width="1024" />
<p>Concurrently, the influx of capital into spot Bitcoin ETFs seems to be diminishing, a development that could be bearish for BTC. </p>

<p>Since its launch in January 2024, Bitcoin prices have been primarily propelled by demand for spot ETFs. </p>
<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/x/b7pGo1Sn/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Bitcoin price trending downward on the daily chart | Source: BTCUSDT on Binance, TradingView" class="size-full" height="904" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/b7pGo1Sn/" width="1787" /></a>
<p>For now, Bitcoin prices remain under immense selling pressure. The coin is edging lower, closer to the $60,000 round number. Whether or not bears will continue pressing prices lower remains to be seen. However, the broader crypto market remains bullish, and the upcoming halving event is expected to stir demand and lift prices.</p>

<title>Genesis Faces $21 Million Penalty As SEC Charges Are Settled</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。<br />加密贷款商Genesis Global同意缴纳2100万美元的民事罚款并永久禁令，解决了与美国证券交易委员会(SEC)相关的未经注册的证券发售指控。SEC的调查发现，Genesis通过其加密资产借贷计划Gemini Earn程序进行了涉嫌的未经注册证券发售。Genesis已同意支付2100万美元的民事罚款，然而SEC将在所有其他允许的索赔，包括Gemini Earn程序的零售投资者索赔，在破产法院得到支付后才能获得其部分罚款。SEC主席Gary Gensler强调遵守证券法律的重要性，特别是对加密货币平台和中介机构。他指出，未注册这些产品并绕过披露要求并非可选，而是法定义务。 SEC执法部门主任Gurbir S. Grewal强调，没有炒作或广告可以代替证券法要求的投资者保护披露。Genesis还与纽约总检察长Letitia James提起的一起诉讼达成和解。目前，加密货币市场总价值出现6%下降，达到2.31万亿美元，同时，市场领头加密货币比特币(BTC)价格下跌6.6%，降至63000美元水平。 <div>
<p>Crypto lender Genesis Global, has agreed to a final judgment imposing a $21 million civil penalty and a permanent injunction as part of a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2024-37" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">settlement </a>with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). </p>
<p>The settlement resolves charges against Genesis related to the unregistered offer and sale of “securities” through its crypto asset lending program, the Gemini Earn program.</p>
<h2>Genesis Settles With SEC</h2>
<p>According to the SEC’s investigations, Genesis engaged in the alleged unregistered offer and sale of securities by operating the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/gemini-to-return-over-1-8b-to-earn-customers-in-regulatory-settlement/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Gemini Earn program</a> without proper registration. </p>

<p>The program allowed Gemini customers, including retail investors in the United States, to loan their <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/digital-currency-group-bankruptcy-code-violations/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">crypto assets</a> to Genesis in exchange for promised interest payments. However, in November 2022, Genesis announced that it could not honor withdrawal requests due to a lack of sufficient liquid assets following volatility in the crypto market.</p>
<p> At that time, Genesis held approximately $900 million in crypto assets from 340,000 Gemini Earn investors.</p>
<p>Genesis has agreed to pay a $21 million civil penalty for the settlement. However, the SEC will only receive its portion of the penalty after all other allowed claims, including those by retail investors in the Gemini Earn program, have been paid in the bankruptcy court. </p>
<p>Genesis and two of its affiliates had filed for voluntary <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/genesis-bankruptcy-plan-faces-criticism-dcg/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Chapter 11 bankruptcy</a> on January 19, 2023, in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.</p>
<h2>Legal Challenges Resolved</h2>
<p>SEC Chair Gary Gensler emphasized the importance of compliance with securities laws by <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/genesis-reaches-1-billion-settlement-with-3ac/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">crypto lending platforms</a> and intermediaries. He stressed that failing to register such products and bypassing disclosure requirements is not optional but a legal obligation. Gensler further stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today’s settlement builds on previous actions to make clear to the marketplace and the investing public that crypto lending platforms and other intermediaries need to comply with our time-tested securities laws. Doing so best protects investors. It promotes trust in markets. It’s not optional. It’s the law.</p></blockquote>
<p>Similarly, Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC&#8217;s Division of Enforcement, emphasized that no hype or advertising can substitute for the investor protection disclosures required by the securities laws.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that Genesis has also settled a separate <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/genesis-resolves-lawsuit-with-ny-attorney-general/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">lawsuit </a>filed by New York Attorney General Letitia James. The lawsuit, which initially targeted Genesis, Digital Currency Group, and Gemini, accused them of defrauding customers of $1.1 billion. However, the settlement disclosed in the New York bankruptcy court focuses solely on Genesis.</p>
<img alt="Genesis" class="size-large" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/Xrt0B8Fg/" width="1815" />
<p>As of the time of writing, the total value of the cryptocurrency market has experienced a 6% decline, reaching a valuation of $2.31 trillion. Simultaneously, Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency in the market, has undergone a 6.6% price correction, decreasing towards the $63,000 price level.</p>

<title>Crypto Analyst Predicts Explosive Rally For Shiba Inu’s BONE With New Target</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-bone-new-target/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-bone-new-target/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章介绍了BONE代币在Shiba Inu生态系统中的表现，包括价格波动和交易量增加。加密分析师SHIB Knight预测BONE代币将出现爆炸性涨势，预计价格将飙升至3美元。文章提到了BONE代币当前价格走势和未来展望，认为随着Shiba Inu生态系统的扩大，BONE有望获得更多价值。此外，BONE代币即将在知名交易所上市，这可能会推动价格进一步上涨。 <div>
<p>BONE, the second-biggest token in the Shiba Inu ecosystem, has had a mixed price movement in the past few days. This up-and-down movement has been accompanied by a surge in trading volume. Crypto analyst SHIB Knight is calling for an <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shibarium-4400-shib-bone/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">explosive rally</a> soon that could send BONE skyrocketing. Notably, the analyst is predicting a surge to $3.  </p>
<h2>Crypto Analyst Predicts Explosive BONE Rally</h2>
<p>BONE recently went on a 32% surge from $0.8191 to $1.0808 to outperform the larger crypto market as most cryptocurrencies <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-at-risk-65k/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">witnessed a decline in prices</a>. Interestingly, this surge was accompanied by a 60% increase in trading volume. </p>

<p>This surge in activity prompted a social media post from SHIB Knight. While acknowledging the rally, the analyst noted that the crypto is expected to “pump more.” The recent post came as an update to a former prediction over the weekend.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BONE&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">$BONE</a> is having a nice pump rn. It will pump more! <img alt="🔥" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f525.png" style="height: 1em;" /><img alt="🚀" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f680.png" style="height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/ao3YvsrJzS" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://t.co/ao3YvsrJzS</a> <a href="https://t.co/P7HbIDVkmk" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/P7HbIDVkmk</a></p>
<p>— $SHIB KNIGHT (@army_shiba) <a href="https://twitter.com/army_shiba/status/1769693757870379212?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">March 18, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>In the chart shared by the analyst, he noted how BONE has been trading in a channel with the formation of lower highs. He also pointed out how BONE had tried to break out of the upper trendline of this channel earlier but failed to do so. However, he remains unfazed and believes a breakout to $3 will happen sooner or later, though he doesn&#8217;t say when.</p>
<h2>What’s Next For BONE?</h2>
<p>Recent price action indicates that BONE has once again failed to break out of this upper trendline, as it has gone in the direction of the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-undergone-bearish-analyst-explains/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">wider bearish trend</a> of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/arbitrum/arbitrum-token-sell-off-whales-transfer-58m-to-exchanges-following-unlock-arb-price-reacts/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">most cryptocurrencies</a>. BONE has reversed most of its recent gains and has fallen by 20% in the past 24 hours and 22.3% in the past seven days. </p>
<p>At the time of writing, BONE is trading at $0.8638, and a surge to $3 would mean a 245% increase from the current price level. While this seems like a very bullish price point, the $3 price isn&#8217;t new territory for BONE, as it has a current all-time high of $15.50.</p>

<p>BONE acts as the governance token within the ShibaSwap decentralized ecosystem and as gas fees for Shibarium, Shiba Inu&#8217;s layer-2 scaling solution. <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-investing-meme-coins/">Team members</a> have proposed <a href="https://twitter.com/LucieSHIB/status/1769920586547867904?s=20" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">several developments</a> on the horizon that could significantly boost BONE&#8217;s price. Overall, BONE appears well-positioned to gain value as long as Shiba Inu&#8217;s ecosystem expands.</p>
<p>Despite its popularity, BONE is yet to be listed on popular exchanges <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-robinhood-bone/">like Robinhood</a> and Binance, and members of the “Shiba Army” have now taken it upon themselves to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bone-binance-shiba-inu-army-campaigns-for-listing/">campaign for a listing on Binance</a>. If successfully listed, the increased accessibility and visibility would likely lead to a price surge for BONE. Perhaps we could see <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bone/shiba-inu-bone-explodes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">increased BONE accumulation</a> from traders in the days leading up to the listing. </p>

<title>Elon Musk Sends Dogecoin Fans Into Frenzy With Cryptic Tweet</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/elon-musk-makes-another-cryptic-tweet/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章讨论了特斯拉创始人埃隆·马斯克在社交媒体上发布的有关梗币的推文引发的热烈讨论，以及他对人工智能领域的贡献。马斯克的推文历来备受争议，同时也对金融市场产生影响。他在Twitter上的行为和影响也引起关注，尤其是在他收购Twitter以来。 <div>
<p>Social media darling Elon Musk sent the meme-coin world into a tailspin with a seemingly innocuous St. Patrick&#8217;s Day tweet. The tech magnate, renowned for his affection for memes and his influence as &#8220;Dogefather&#8221;, posted a lighthearted image featuring three dogs adorned in festive green hats, one of them a Shiba Inu, the mascot of Dogecoin.</p>

<h2><strong>Memecoin Fans React To Elon Musk X Post</strong></h2>
<p>This seemingly casual social media activity sparked a vibrant response from the meme-coin community. Crypto accounts affiliated with Dogecoin, Floki Inu (FLOKI), and Shiba Inu (SHIB) flooded the replies with enthusiastic messages, some featuring their own canine mascots.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p></p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time Musk has, intentionally or unintentionally, impacted the meme-coin market. In 2021, a tweet showcasing his newly adopted Shiba Inu puppy, named Floki in homage to a character from Vikings, is believed to have triggered the launch of the Floki Inu coin. Interestingly, the same day witnessed the birth of Baby Doge Coin, further solidifying Musk&#8217;s reputation as a meme-coin kingmaker.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p></p>
<p>Meanwhile, as memecoin enthusiasts revelled in Musk&#8217;s festive tweet, the tech mogul was making significant strides on another technological front – Artificial Intelligence. His recently established company, xAI, has delivered on its earlier promise by open-sourcing Grok, its AI chatbot.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/bFxcyvE5/" width="1835" /></p>

<p>This move marks a significant contribution to the field of transparent AI development. By open-sourcing Grok, xAI has granted public access to the architecture and core functionalities of this mammoth 314 billion parameter language model.</p>
<h2><strong>Musk&#8217;s Twitter Impact: From Controversy To Financial Market Influence</strong></h2>
<p>The tweets made by Elon Musk have been <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-community-abuzz-musk-x-post/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">a subject of significant attention</a> and controversy due to their impact and content. Musk, a prolific tweeter with a massive following, has a history of posting tweets that have stirred both positive and negative reactions. Over the years, Musk has been known to delete tweets shortly after posting them, with hundreds being removed within hours of publication. </p>
<p>Notably, some of his tweets have led to serious consequences, such as the infamous tweet in 2018 where he claimed to have secured funding to take Tesla private at $420 a share, resulting in charges from the Securities and Exchange Commission and a subsequent settlement that imposed restrictions on his Twitter activity regarding Tesla.</p>

<p>The billionaire&#8217;s acquisition of Twitter and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/musk-x-rebrand-for-twitter-opposed/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">subsequent actions</a> as the platform&#8217;s owner have also drawn attention. Since taking over Twitter, Musk has expressed his commitment to free speech and diversifying voices on the platform. </p>
<p>However, despite his intentions, his Twitter feed has been criticized for often acting as an echo chamber, where he interacts mainly with accounts that support him or post about him.</p>
<p>This behavior has raised concerns about how Twitter may evolve under his leadership. Moreover, his tweets have had a direct impact on financial markets. Several instances stand out where his tweets influenced Tesla&#8217;s stock prices significantly. </p>
<p>For example, Musk&#8217;s tweet questioning Hertz Global Holdings Inc.&#8217;s deal to buy Teslas for its rental-car fleet led to a 3% drop in Tesla&#8217;s stock the following day. Similarly, his tweets about Tesla&#8217;s valuation or production predictions have caused fluctuations in the company&#8217;s stock prices.</p>

<title>MicroStrategy Now Holds 1% Of All Bitcoin In Existence</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/microstrategy-1-of-all-bitcoin/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/microstrategy-1-of-all-bitcoin/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。微战略公司宣布用可转换票据和多余现金收购了9245个比特币，从而将公司持有的比特币总数增加到214,246个。该公司完成了一笔私人可转换票据的增发，总额达6.0375亿美元，引起市场广泛关注。Michael Saylor表达了对比特币的信心，并表示计划继续收购。社区对微战略公司的最新收购表示赞赏。击贬币 。. <div>
<p>On Tuesday, MicroStrategy announced the acquisition of an additional 9,245 BTC for approximately $623.0 million, using proceeds from convertible notes and excess cash. This purchase brings the company&#8217;s total holdings to 214,246 BTC. This figure represents more than 1.0% of the total 21 million Bitcoin that will ever exist, marking a significant milestone for both MicroStrategy and the community at large.</p>
<p>Michael Saylor, the CEO of MicroStrategy, <a href="https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1770061111146033385" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">shared</a> the news on X (formerly Twitter), stating, &#8220;MicroStrategy has acquired an additional 9,245 BTC for ~$623.0M using proceeds from convertible notes &amp; excess cash for ~$67,382 per #bitcoin. As of 3/18/24, MSTR hodls 214,246 BTC acquired for ~$7.53B at average price of $35,160 per bitcoin.”</p>
<p>The funding for this significant acquisition came from a private offering of convertible senior notes, which concluded with an upsized aggregate principal amount of $603.75 million. This offering attracted substantial interest, leading to an oversubscription and the exercise of an option by initial purchasers to buy an additional $78.75 million worth of notes.</p>

<p>According to MicroStrategy&#8217;s official <a href="https://www.microstrategy.com/press/microstrategy-completes-603-million-offering-of-0875-convertible-senior-notes-due-2031_03-19-2024" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a>, &#8220;The Offering, which included a 0.875% coupon and an approximately 40% conversion premium over the US composite volume weighted average price of MicroStrategy’s class A common stock, was well received in the marketplace.&#8221;</p>
<p>The convertible notes, due in 2031, offer flexibility to holders with rights for early repurchase and conversion into cash, shares of MicroStrategy&#8217;s class A common stock, or a combination thereof under specific conditions. This innovative financial instrument reflects <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/microstrategy-bitcoin-bet-btc/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">MicroStrategy&#8217;s sophisticated approach</a> to capital management and its bullish outlook on Bitcoin.</p>
<h2>The Bitcoin Community Reacts</h2>
<p>The community has lauded MicroStrategy&#8217;s latest acquisition. Bitcoin Munger <a href="https://twitter.com/bitcoinmunger/status/1770059884085621201" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">commented</a>, “Saylor is like a kid in a candy store with this current dip. Still surprised that the market would give him this dip, but coins are moving from lettuce hands to diamond hands.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, prominent figures like Dylan LeClair and WhalePanda have acknowledged the company&#8217;s significant market position, with LeClair <a href="https://twitter.com/DylanLeClair_/status/1770061493922382059" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">stating</a>, “&gt;1.0% of 21,000,000 Bitcoin. Congrats Saylor &amp; MicroStrategy. Legendary,” and WhalePanda <a href="https://twitter.com/WhalePanda/status/1770059536847536163" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">adding</a>, “Saylor thanks you for your weak hands.”</p>

<p>MicroStrategy&#8217;s aggressive accumulation of BTC not only demonstrates its confidence in the digital currency as a viable investment asset but also could have significant impact on market dynamics. This milestone of holding more than 1% of all BTC&#8217;s in existence is a monumental step for Saylor.</p>
<p>More recently, Michael Saylor&#8217;s bet on BTC was compared to Nelson Bunker Hunt&#8217;s historical attempt to corner the silver market. Both invested heavily with the conviction that their chosen asset (<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/rap-star-drake-bitcoin-to-the-masses/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">BTC for Saylor</a>, silver for the Hunts) was undervalued and poised for significant appreciation. Each believed strongly in the future value of their chosen asset, seeing it as a hedge against economic uncertainty and inflation.</p>

<title>Mega Bank Says Ethereum Price Could Reach $14,000, Here’s Why</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-price-reach-14000/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。标准银行预测以太坊价格将飙升至14,000美元，主要受到美国证券交易委员会可能批准以太坊现货交易所交易基金的驱动。分析师预计，如果SEC批准ETH ETF，以太坊价格将在2025年前达到14,000美元。预测还涉及到以太坊ETF将带来450亿美元的资金流入市场。此外，以太坊2.0升级和投资者对加密货币的需求也将推动以太坊价格上涨。 <div>
<p>Leading international cross-border bank, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/standard-chartered-sees-bitcoin-200k/">Standard Chartered</a> has made another bullish prediction for Ethereum. According to analysts from the bank, ETH could see a rise to new all-time highs, driven by the potential introduction of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/approval-denial-ethereum-etf-sell-the-news-event/">Spot ETH Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). </a></p>
<h2>ETH Price Set To Rise To $14,000</h2>
<p>Analysts at Standard Chartered Bank have maintained an <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-takes-hit-3680/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">optimistic outlook for ETH</a>, anticipating that the second-largest cryptocurrency could witness an exponential surge to $14,000 by 2025. </p>

<p>Detailed in a Monday note, the analysts revealed <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-aims-for-10000-driven-by-2-key-factors-according-to-experts/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">key factors</a> that could drive Ethereum towards the predicted price target. Notably, the potential <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-etf-issuers-brace-for-sec-march-meeting/">approval of an Ethereum Spot ETF</a> by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is a primary catalyst for ETH&#8217;s projected surge. </p>
<p>According to the analysts at Standard Chartered, if the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/coinbase-sec-5-arguments-spot-ethereum-etf/">SEC greenlights Spot Ethereum ETFs</a>, ETH could follow a straight road map to <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/standard-chartered-bitcoin-ethereum-prediction-year-end/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">$8,000 by the end of 2024</a> and $14,000 by 2025. The analysts have maintained an optimistic outlook regarding the approval of Ethereum Spot ETFs, anticipating the SEC’s authorization by May 2024. </p>
<p>The firm emphasized yet another significant factor that could propel the price of ETH to $14,000 &#8211; <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-finalizes-dencun-upgrade-on-testnets/">Ethereum’s recent Dencun upgrade. </a>Geoffrey Kendrick, Standard Chartered’s Head of Forex and Crypto Research anticipates an influx of demand for the cryptocurrency, citing potential <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-fees-spike-but-relief-on-the-horizon/">reduction in transaction costs</a> and improvements to the Ethereum blockchain facilitated by upgrade as key drivers.</p>
<h2>Ethereum Spot ETFs Projected To Draw $45 Billion</h2>
<p>In addition to his <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-new-5000-target/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">bullish projections for ETH</a>, Kendrick has also stated that Spot Ethereum ETFs could trigger a whopping $45 billion in inflows into the market. While there has been a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cloudy-future-for-ethereum-etfs-whats-casting-doubt-on-their-fate/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">decline in overall optimism</a> regarding the SEC’s potential approval of Ethereum ETFs by May, the analyst has maintained a positive outlook, affirming the possibility of the SEC granting approval for these investment assets by the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sec-bitcoin-ethereum-etfs-deadline/">specified deadline</a> of May 23, 2024. </p>

<p>According to Kendrick’s insights shared with The Block, he has estimated inflows ranging from $15 billion to $45 billion within the first 12 months following the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-etfs-approval-odds-drop-to-35/">approval of Spot ETH ETFs. </a></p>
<p>The crypto analyst indicated that he intends to apply the same methodology for estimating <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etfs-new-ath-inflows-coinbase-reserves/">Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows</a> in his analysis. His reasoning suggests a similar trajectory for ETH&#8217;s future outlook as witnessed with Bitcoin following its ETF approval. </p>
<p>Just as millions of dollars poured into the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/without-spot-bitcoin-etfs-btc-down-20-founder/">Spot Bitcoin ETF</a> market after the SEC’s acceptance, a similar scenario could potentially unfold for Ethereum if its ETF is authorized. In such an event, the price of the cryptocurrency could witness a significant rise to <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-rally-4k/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">new all-time highs</a>, propelled by a surge in investor interest and capital inflows.</p>

<title>This Signal Points To End Of Bull Phase For Bitcoin, Quant Says</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/signal-points-end-bull-phase-bitcoin-quant-says/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> 摘要：<br /><br />这些信息是消极的。一位量化分析师指出比特币在链指标NUPL显示出了一个可能暗示牛市可能接近尾声的模式。NUPL指标显示投资者持有的未实现利润或损失数量，最近已经进入过热水平多周。历史数据表明，当NUPL超过0.6水平时，比特币往往会出现顶部和价格回调。当前NUPL处于“过热”区域已经将近3周，这可能预示着比特币可能面临更强烈的价格调整。比特币目前交易于约63,000美元，过去一周下跌12%。 <div>
<p>A quant has pointed out a pattern in a Bitcoin on-chain indicator that may imply the bull phase may be close to ending for now.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin NUPL Has Been At Overheated Levels For Weeks Now</h2>
<p>In a CryptoQuant Quicktake <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/65f89926bcdd3c42d0a27b8c-Another-sign-of-bull-phase-ending" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, an analyst has talked about a bearish development that has recently occurred in the Bitcoin &#8220;<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/the-bitcoin-bull-cycle-is-underway-analyst-confirms/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Net Unrealized Profit/Loss</a>&#8221; (NUPL) indicator.</p>
<p>As its name already suggests, the NUPL keeps track of the net amount of unrealized profit or loss that the investors of the cryptocurrency as a whole are holding right now. This metric works by going through the on-chain history of each token in circulation to see what price it was last moved at.</p>

<p>With the assumption that the previous transfer for any coin was the last point it changed hands, the metric subtracts the price at its time from the current price to find the exact amount of profit or loss it is currently carrying.</p>
<p>The indicator then sums up these values for the entire circulating supply to determine the net profit/loss status of the market. Naturally, positive values imply the investors as a whole are in the green, while values under zero imply the dominance of underwater supply.</p>
<p>Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin NUPL over the past few years:</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin NUPL" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="975" src="https://i0.wp.com/img.cryptoquant.com/322923/quicktake/qnGDqmBB0_4ade16ab9a5ca400aa560adf3c6692e22209f53fe4253aa66145fc2399c8b36f.png?resize=1680%2C975&#038;ssl=1" width="1680" /></p>

<p>As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin NUPL has attained highly positive levels recently, which is obviously a natural conclusion of the sharp rally the cryptocurrency has gone through.</p>
<p>During this surge, the indicator has managed to breach the 0.6 level. The quant has pointed out, however, that historically, it has been quite rare that the asset has been able to sustain above this mark.</p>
<p>This pattern is visible in the chart, as tops have often been encountered as the NUPL has crossed this boundary. Only periods where the indicator did manage to continue to surge past this level in recent years was during the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/founder-btc-bitcoin-bull-run-just-getting-started/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">bull runs</a> in 2017 and first half 2021.</p>
<p>Even the November 2021 price all-time high (ATH) was hit not too long after the indicator entered this territory of overheating. &#8220;We have been in the &#8220;overbought&#8221; zone for almost 3 weeks now and in the past it took between 3 to 6 weeks before a stronger correction in price occurred,&#8221; notes the analyst.</p>

<p>Thus, going by this historical pattern, it&#8217;s possible that a steep correction may be coming for Bitcoin in the near future, or it may have even already started considering the recent price plunge.</p>
<p>Usually, investors in profit are more likely to sell their coins and this tendency to sell goes up the more their profits swell. This is why historically the asset has been probable to see <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-inflows-binance-spike-whales-2024-selloff/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">selloffs</a> at high values of the NUPL.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $63,000, down 12% over the past week.</p>

<title>Fidelity Adjusts Ethereum ETF Application, Optimistic About Regulatory Approval</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/fidelity-adjusts-ethereum-etf-application/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/fidelity-adjusts-ethereum-etf-application/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章讨论了多个金融管理公司申请以太坊现货ETF产品的情况。财务管理公司Fidelity修改了其申请，展现出对美国证券交易委员会（SEC）批准的信心。该更新包含对现货和期货市场之间联系的更彻底的考察。此外，Grayscale也更新了其以太坊ETF提案，这对于将ETHE上市至NYSE Arca是一个关键步骤。最后，文章提到了Fidelity计划允许交易者在其提议的以太坊基金中抵押资产的计划，以及提到了以太坊网络奖励的相关信息。 <div>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-etfs-jeopardy-staking-yields-bitmex/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Spot Ethereum Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)</a> may be witnessing a decline in approval odds, but there is still a wave of optimism among several financial management firms applying for the products.</p>
<h2>Fidelity Amends Its Ethereum Spot ETF Application</h2>
<p>Amid the anticipation encompassing the Ethereum spot ETFs, financial management giant <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sec-delays-fidelity-spot-ethereum-etf/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Fidelity</a> has recently amended its application for the exchange products, demonstrating confidence toward approval by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>



<p>Chairman and President of The ETF Store, Nate Geraci, took to the social media platform X to <a href="https://x.com/NateGeraci/status/1769893614576980281?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">share</a> the update with the crypto community today. According to Nate Geraci, the amendment contains a &#8220;more thorough examination&#8221; of the connection between the spot and futures markets.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that Fidelity entered the competition to introduce an Ethereum ETF in November last year. Other applicants for the ETFs include Grayscale, Ark Invest, 21Shares, and BlackRock, among others.</p>
<p>Geraci mentioned that the update cites the acceptance of a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/4-bitcoin-etfs-get-nod-190-billion-wealth-manager/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">spot Bitcoin ETF</a>. He also shared a screenshot from the latest filing, while noting that the passage is the &#8220;money page.&#8221; This is because the &#8220;SEC will not be let off the hook by Ethereum ETFs issuers.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the filing, Fidelity claims that &#8220;given the firm correlation between Ethereum and Bitcoin futures offered by Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), applying the same grounds that the SEC used to approval a spot Bitcoin product suggests that the test is satisfied for this proposal.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the &#8220;SEC anticipates that the CME&#8217;s surveillance will help identify potential instances of deceptive and manipulative acts,&#8221; the financial firm argues that &#8220;<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-analyst-bullish-on-ethereum-and-xrp/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ethereum </a>ETFs should be identified using the same logic.&#8221;</p>
<p>By updating its application, Fidelity plans to permit traders and users in its proposed Ethereum fund to stake a portion of the assets. The Registration Statement <a href="https://cdn.cboe.com/resources/regulation/rule_filings/pending/2023/SR-CboeBZX-2023-095-Amendment-No-1.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">states</a> that the &#8220;Sponsor may occasionally stake a portion of the Fund&#8217;s assets through one or more reputable staking providers, some of whom may be Sponsor affiliates or Staking Providers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Additionally, &#8220;the Fund would get specific network rewards in the form of Ether tokens&#8221; for any staking activity it might perform. These rewards could be considered as &#8220;income for the Fund&#8221; as compensation for the services rendered. </p>
<h2>Grayscale Updates Its ETH ETF Proposal</h2>
<p>Fidelity is the latest firm to amend its Ethereum spot ETF application after financial behemoth Grayscale. On Friday, Grayscale <a href="https://x.com/CraigSalm/status/1768750794021511218?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reported</a> that the firm had updated its proposal for the products, which marks a vital step in uplisting ETHE to NYSE Arca.</p>

<p>As with spot Bitcoin ETFs, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-funds-lose-500m-as-grayscales-outflow-wanes/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Grayscale</a> thinks the case for spot ETH ETFs is just as strong, and investors demand and deserve exposure to ETH in this aspect.</p>
<p>In compliance with the guidelines mentioned in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, Section 19(b) and Rule 19b-4, NYSE Arca intends to list and trade the shares of the following under NYSE rule 8.201.</p>

<title>Why Is The Shiba Inu Price Down Today?</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-price-down-today/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-price-down-today/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是负面的。<br />在过去的一天里，由于比特币价格失去了65000美元的支撑，Shiba Inu遭受了巨大的下跌。这次市场崩溃部分是对即将于3月20日星期三举行的美联储公开市场委员会（FOMC）的反应。Shiba Inu的价格跌幅超过10%，市场遭受了严重打击。然而，一位分析师认为，尽管目前的状况不佳，Shiba Inu仍然表现出强大的力量，并预计它将很快反弹。 <div>
<p class="p2">The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-investing-meme-coins/">Shiba Inu price</a> has seen a massive drawdown in the last day as the Bitcoin price lost its support at $65,000. As a result, the SHIB price is down more than 10% in a single day, with what is arguably one of the worst crypto trading days in crypto so far this year. But what is behind this market crash?</p>
<h2 class="p2">Crypto Market Fumbles On FOMC</h2>
<p class="p2">The crypto market seems to be already reacting to the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">meeting</a> which is scheduled to take place on Wednesday, March 20. Expectations are quite lax for the outcome of the meeting. Nevertheless, investors and traders are looking toward the outcome as something that could significantly impact the crypto market.</p>

<p class="p2">Alongside this, Bitcoin is also going through an expected correction after what has been a green year, moving from $20,000 to a new all-time high above $73,000. As <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoins-price-trajectory-analyst-spells-out-three/">the Bitcoin price</a> sees a correction through this crash, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-burn-rate-2300/">likes of Shiba Inu</a> have also seen their prices correct sharply as well.</p>
<p class="p2">Shiba Inu’s double-digit losses have triggered a decline toward $0.000052, eliminating around 50% of its gains from the last month. Likewise, the daily trading volume of the meme coin has taken a significant hit as well, with CoinMarketCap data showing a 28.4% crash to bring its daily trading volume to $1.73 billion.</p>
<p class="p2">The meme coin is down more than 22% on the weekly chart as well, which has brought its market cap to $14.89 billion. As a result of this, Shiba Inu continues to lag as the 11th-largest cryptocurrency in the world behind rival <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-shiba-inu-drop-15/">Dogecoin</a>, which sits in the 10th spot.</p>
<h2 class="p2">What’s Next For Shiba Inu?</h2>
<p class="p2">For now, the whole crypto market, including Shiba Inu, looks to be following Bitcoin’s lead. This means that any further decline or recovery in the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-burn-rate-2300/">SHIB price</a> will be directly tied to the outcome for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-targets-500000-scary-dips/">Bitcoin</a>, and since <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoins-price-trajectory-analyst-spells-out-three/">BTC</a> is currently in its pre-halving crash, it might continue to struggle until the halving in April.</p>

<p class="p2">However, this has not affected the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-price-0-0001-target/">bullish outlook</a> that investors have for the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-shiba-inu-drop-15/">SHIB price</a> as one analyst believes that this is only a temporary setback. Crypto Analyst Javon Marks took to X (formerly Twitter) to <a href="https://x.com/JavonTM1/status/1768049122290929876?s=20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reveal</a> that Shiba Inu has shown massive strength since 2023. But there is still more to go.</p>
<p class="p2">Marks continues to stand by his breakout target of $0.000081 for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-investing-meme-coins/">SHIB</a>, which from current price levels, would see it do another 350% move to get there. So while <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-price-0-0001-target/">SHIB</a> has suffered in the last day, expectations are that it will turnaround soon.</p>

<title>Ripple Celebrates Brazilian Real Stablecoin Integration On XRP Ledger</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-brazilian-real-stablecoin-xrp-ledger/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-brazilian-real-stablecoin-xrp-ledger/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br /> RippleX宣布将稳定币BRLA Token整合到XRP Ledger，为跨境和国内交易提供稳定性和效率。BRLA Token由BRLA Digital推出，旨在简化商业交易，通过将价值锚定巴西雷亚尔并备有审计准备金保障稳定性。该稳定币支持透明度和安全，利用巴西最安全的资产类别，政府国库券。团队有丰富的行业经验和技术背景，致力于改变巴西金融基础设施，让BRLA Token成为新一代金融解决方案的开创者。 <div>
<p>RippleX, the development arm of Ripple, has formally announced the integration of the BRLA Token, a stablecoin pegged to the Brazilian Real (BRL), on the XRP Ledger. This event signifies a crucial advancement for the XRP Ledger and its ecosystem, offering a new layer of stability and efficiency for cross-border and domestic transactions.</p>
<h2>Ripple Praises New BRL Stablecoin</h2>
<p>“Designed to facilitate seamless and cost-effective transactions, BRLA Token offers businesses a reliable avenue for both domestic and international payments. The team has been exploring and testing the XRP Ledger extensively for payment processing, with much more excitement on the horizon,” RippleX stated in a blog post.</p>
<p>BRLA Digital, spearheading this innovation, aims to disrupt the traditional <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/is-brazil-ready-for-the-crypto-economy-the-data-agrees-vehemently/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">financial sector in Brazil</a>. Their creation, the BRLA Token, is crafted to simplify and economize business transactions, both internationally and within the country.</p>
<p>RippleX&#8217;s enthusiasm about this collaboration is evident. In a <a href="https://twitter.com/RippleXDev/status/1769830638817821006" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">statement</a> shared on X (formerly Twitter), they remarked, &#8220;BRLA Digital&#8217;s commitment to evolving Brazil&#8217;s financial scene comes to fruition with the BRLA Token. This venture into stablecoins signifies a pivotal stride towards redefining business transactions in Brazil.&#8221;</p>

<p>This initiative by BRLA Digital to bring the BRLA Token to the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-ledger-partnership-to-integrate-smart-contracts/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">XRP Ledger</a> showcases an ambitious effort to bridge the gap between conventional financial services and the burgeoning field of digital currency. Focusing on business-to-business (B2B) transactions, the move is designed to streamline payment processes, making them more accessible and less susceptible to the unpredictability of cryptocurrency markets.</p>
Key Features Of The BRLA Token
<p>Central to the value proposition of the BRLA Token is its foundation in stability. &#8220;By anchoring the BRLA Token&#8217;s value to the Brazilian Real and backing it with audited reserves, we ensure a stable and reliable medium for transactions, shielding businesses from the whims of cryptocurrency volatility,&#8221; explains Ripple. This stability is crucial for businesses seeking consistency in their financial operations.</p>
<p>Transparency is another pillar upon which the BRLA Token stands. &#8220;Our commitment to transparency is unwavering, with regular, audited transparency reports that reaffirm the token&#8217;s solid backing,&#8221; BRLA Digital asserts. This openness is intended to build trust among users, reassuring them of the token&#8217;s integrity and the security of their transactions.</p>

<p>Regarding security, Ripple emphasizes the decentralized and secure nature of the BRLA Token transactions on the blockchain. &#8220;We leverage Brazil&#8217;s safest asset class, government treasury bills, through the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/brazil-itau-unibanco-launche-bitcoin-ethereum-trade/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">nation&#8217;s most reputable banks</a>, ensuring the utmost security and integrity of the BRLA Token&#8217;s backing,&#8221; they note.</p>
Transforming Brazilian Payments
<p>RippleX&#8217;s blog post further illuminates the innovation the BRLA Token brings to the financial sector: &#8220;The BRLA Token not only facilitates transactional efficiency but also spearheads the development of decentralized applications rooted in the Brazilian Real, heralding a new era of financial solutions on the blockchain.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team behind BRLA Digital, comprising industry veterans like Matheus Moura, Luiz Castelo Branco, Lucas Giorgio, Hector Fardin, and Leandro Noel, is celebrated by Ripple for their combined expertise in finance, technology, and entrepreneurship. Their collective experiences, enriched by past ventures and academic achievements at the Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica (ITA), fuel their mission to revolutionize Brazil&#8217;s financial infrastructure.</p>
<p>At press time, XRP traded at $0.5852.</p>

<p>In a strategic move ahead of regulatory changes, OKX, the fourth-largest global cryptocurrency exchange, has decided to discontinue <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">USDT</a> trading pairs in the European Economic Area (EEA).</p>
<p>The decision, aimed at aligning with forthcoming Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations, reflects the exchange&#8217;s focus on euro-denominated liquidity within the region. OKX aims to become the preferred venue for euro to crypto spot trading and plans to expand its product offering in the EEA by introducing a variety of Euro fiat onramps and Euro pairs.</p>

<h2><strong>OKX Aligns with MiCA: USDT Trading Suspension Signals Compliance Efforts</strong></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-18/crypto-exchange-okx-to-pull-tether-trading-pairs-in-europe" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">discontinuation of USDT trading pairs</a> is expected to impact users located in the EEA, and the prohibition will be fully enforced until December 30, 2024. This move signifies a proactive stance by OKX and other exchanges towards complying with local and international financial regulations, particularly in light of the MiCA framework.</p>
<p>MiCA is a comprehensive regulatory approach aiming to govern stablecoins like USDT, protect the European Union&#8217;s financial ecosystem, and foster innovation in the fintech sector.</p>

<p></p>
<p>While the impact of these regulatory actions on the cryptocurrency market remains uncertain, OKX&#8217;s decision reflects a growing trend towards increased regulatory adherence in the industry.</p>
<p>However, there have been concerns regarding a lack of reconciliation between the removal of USDT from EEA traders and the information previously stated on the OKX website. Some speculate that this discrepancy indicates potential unpreparedness on the part of the exchange for the upcoming regulatory changes.</p>
<h2><strong>Regulatory Pressure Mounts: OKX USDT Trading Halt Signals EU Concerns</strong></h2>
<p>USDT is currently the largest stablecoin in terms of trading volume, serving as a vital infrastructure for crypto trading on centralized exchanges. The discontinuation of USDT trading pairs by OKX could foreshadow potential regulatory headwinds for the world&#8217;s most popular stablecoin within the EU.</p>
<p>As the MiCA framework is set to be implemented later this year, the EU&#8217;s dedication to increased supervision of cryptocurrencies is evident, raising questions about the future utility and popularity of digital assets in the region.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/SGg54CG0/" width="2475" /></p>

<p>In response to the regulatory changes in Europe, OKX has been expanding its global footprint and exploring new strategic approaches. Recently, the exchange launched OKX Argentina, introducing a crypto wallet and digital asset platform tailored to the region.</p>
<p>The expansion includes a peer-to-peer (P2P) network that enables customers to purchase cryptocurrencies directly from verified local sources. OKX&#8217;s user-centric approach and integration of popular local payment methods aim to accelerate adoption and address the specific needs of Argentine residents.</p>

<p>Hong Fang, the President of OKX, emphasized the significance of the expansion and its role in OKX&#8217;s regional growth strategy. By focusing on local requirements and providing Spanish-speaking support, OKX aims to facilitate crypto adoption in Argentina and establish itself as a key player in the market.</p>
<p>As OKX discontinues USDT trading pairs in Europe, other cryptocurrency exchanges are also expected to take similar steps towards regulatory compliance. The cryptocurrency industry as a whole appears to be shifting its focus towards adhering to financial regulations, reflecting a broader trend in the market.</p>
<p>The true impact of these regulatory actions on the crypto market will only become apparent over time, but OKX&#8217;s proactive measures indicate a growing emphasis on regulatory adherence and a changing landscape for digital assets in Europe.</p>

<title>Due To Ethereum Bias: Govt. Watchdog Sues SEC Over ‘ETH Gate’</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-watchdog-sues-sec-over-eth-gate/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-watchdog-sues-sec-over-eth-gate/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。Empower Oversight对证券交易委员会（SEC）提起诉讼，指控其未能遵守《信息自由法》的请求。调查SEC对加密货币（尤其是以太坊）监管的不一致性和透明度。'ETH Gate'争议涉及前SEC官员William Hinman和Jay Clayton的行动和言论。Empower Oversight的FOIA请求旨在揭露SEC与加密货币之间的潜在偏见和道德违规。SEC被指控拖延并未能进行搜索，导致多起诉讼。这些法律斗争可能对未来的监管政策产生重要影响。以太坊（ETH）目前交易在3376美元。 <div>
<p>Empower Oversight, a government watchdog organization, has <a href="https://empowr.us/empower-oversight-sues-sec-for-more-crypto-conflict-documents/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">filed</a> a lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), accusing the agency of failing to comply with a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. This request aimed to uncover potential conflicts of interest and biases within the SEC concerning its regulation of cryptocurrencies, particularly Ethereum.</p>
<h2>Investigation Into SEC&#8217;s Ethereum Dealings Continue</h2>
<p>The dealings, commonly referred to as &#8216;<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-army-clues-hinman-ethereum-free-pass-ripple/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">ETH Gate</a>,&#8217; highlight deepening concerns over the consistency and transparency of the SEC&#8217;s approach to digital asset regulation.In a public statement, Tristan Leavitt, President of Empower Oversight, criticized the SEC&#8217;s handling of their FOIA request:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>By slow walking their response to our FOIA request, the SEC is stonewalling Empower’s oversight into SEC officials with conflicts of interest on cryptocurrency issues. The public has a right to see all documents that relate to how these public officials violated ethics guidance and how the agency failed to hold them accountable.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The core of the &#8216;ETH Gate&#8217; controversy revolves around the actions and speeches of two key former SEC figures: William Hinman, the Director of the Division of Corporate Finance from May 2017 to December 2020, and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-spot-etf-inevitable/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Jay Clayton</a>, former SEC Chairman.</p>

<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-clo-demands-answers-from-sec/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Hinman&#8217;s June 14, 2018, speech</a>, where he publicly stated that Ethereum (ETH) was not considered a security by the SEC, has been a focal point of scrutiny. This position seemingly contradicted the SEC&#8217;s later aggressive stance against Ripple Labs&#8217; XRP, which the SEC classified as a security towards the end of Clayton&#8217;s tenure.</p>
<p>Empower Oversight&#8217;s FOIA requests, initiated in August 2021, sought to uncover the extent of potential biases and ethical violations within the SEC&#8217;s dealings with cryptocurrencies. The organization&#8217;s investigation was partly spurred by revelations about Hinman&#8217;s financial ties to his former employer, Simpson Thacher, which is known to have interests in promoting Ethereum.</p>
<p>These revelations raised questions about the impartiality of the SEC&#8217;s regulatory actions and the potential for conflicts of interest at the highest levels of the agency.</p>
<p>Despite the SEC&#8217;s initial agreement to search for relevant records based on terms provided by Empower Oversight, the agency has been accused of stalling and failing to conduct these searches, leading to multiple lawsuits aimed at compelling the SEC to release the requested documents. Empower Oversight&#8217;s persistent legal efforts have so far resulted in the SEC turning over 324 pages of documents following a lawsuit related to a December 2022 <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-sec-xrp-foia-request-jp-morgan-delayed/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">FOIA request</a>.</p>

<p>The latest lawsuit filed by Empower Oversight in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia seeks to enforce compliance with this December 2022 FOIA request. Leavitt&#8217;s communication on X (formerly Twitter) emphasizes the broader stakes of their campaign: &#8220;Empower Oversight has filed a new lawsuit against the SEC because of its refusal to comply with FOIA. #ethgate [&#8230;] So the fight continues for transparency, without which accountability is never possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8216;ETH Gate&#8217; not only exposes potential conflicts of interest and selective enforcement within the SEC but also raises significant questions about the agency&#8217;s regulatory framework and its impact on the crypto market. As this legal battle unfolds, it promises to provide critical insights into the SEC&#8217;s internal decision-making processes, potentially influencing future regulatory policies and the landscape of digital asset regulation.</p>
<p>At press time, Ethereum (ETH) traded at $3,376.</p>

<title>Debt Box Fallout: Judge Penalizes SEC For ‘Abuse Of Power’ Over Crypto Firm</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/debt-box-judge-penalizes-sec-for-abuse-of-power/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/debt-box-judge-penalizes-sec-for-abuse-of-power/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。一位联邦法官对美国证券交易委员会（SEC）在诉讼中对犹他州加密公司Debt Box进行处理的方式进行了尖锐的谴责。法官认为SEC在获取临时限制令时采取了“恶意行为”和“权力滥用”，并对他们加以制裁。这一裁决对加密交易所和SEC在加里·根斯勒主持下的执法记录都有重大影响。此外，裁决还引发了对SEC使用临时限制令的严重问题，并可能对其监管方法产生影响。最后，法官的裁决并不是针对Debt Box公司的有罪或无罪，诉讼仍在继续。 <div>
<p>In a scathing rebuke, a federal judge has sanctioned the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for its handling of a lawsuit against Utah-based crypto firm Debt Box. The case, which has become a lightning rod for the crypto industry, exposes the<a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/sec-blasted-by-judge-for-gross-abuse-of-power-in-crypto-case-1.2048545" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> SEC&#8217;s aggressive enforcement tactics</a> and raises questions about the agency&#8217;s use of legal tools.</p>

<p>The saga began in July 2023 when the SEC accused DEBT Box of defrauding investors out of nearly $50 million by selling unregistered securities in the form of &#8220;node licenses&#8221; for crypto mining.</p>
<p>In a dramatic move, the agency secured a temporary restraining order (TRO) freezing Debt Box&#8217;s assets. This extraordinary measure, typically used when a defendant poses a flight risk or could destroy evidence, was granted without notifying the company.</p>
<h2><strong>SEC Rebuked: Judge Ruling Favors Debt Box In Dispute Over Misrepresentation</strong></h2>
<p>However, Debt Box fiercely contested the SEC&#8217;s narrative. They claimed the agency misrepresented key facts to obtain the TRO, alleging the exchange was not aware of the investigation and had no intention of fleeing the country.</p>
<p><a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/c5bd0wqjc7v0/1u6cDaFa3REg8wHUc6onZ8/e1257f64a80ca440d887f67821f872fe/Debt_Box_Order.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Judge Robert Shelby</a>, after reviewing the evidence, agreed. In a December order, he slammed the SEC&#8217;s actions as &#8220;bad faith conduct&#8221; and a &#8220;gross abuse of power.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><img alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f6a8.png" style="height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://twitter.com/GaryGensler?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">@GaryGensler</a>’s SEC continues its losing streak in the courts.</p>
<p>A judge has ruled against the SEC in the DEBT Box case—imposing sanctions on the Commission for acting in bad faith.</p>
<p>This is one of the most alarming examples yet of Gensler’s abuse of power.</p>
<p>— Financial Services GOP (@FinancialCmte) <a href="https://twitter.com/FinancialCmte/status/1769855183352193081?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">March 18, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>The SEC initially admitted to mistakes and apologized for the &#8220;shortfall&#8221; in the case. However, they maintained their lawyers had not acted in bad faith and requested the judge waive sanctions.</p>
<p>This attempt at damage control proved futile. In a recent 80-page ruling, Judge Shelby not only sanctioned the SEC by requiring them to cover Debt Box&#8217;s legal fees related to the TRO, but also denied their motion to dismiss the lawsuit without prejudice.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/1u6hadqR/" width="2475" /></p>

<p>This decision has significant implications. Firstly, it&#8217;s a major victory for the crypto exchange and a blow to the SEC&#8217;s enforcement record under Chair Gary Gensler.</p>
<p>Critics, including a group of Republican senators, have long expressed concern about the agency&#8217;s zealous approach to regulating the crypto sector. This case provides concrete evidence that the SEC&#8217;s methods might be overly aggressive.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Federal Court Imposes Sanctions on SEC for Misconduct in Debt Box Lawsuit</p>
<p>In a significant turn of events, the United States District Court has imposed sanctions on the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for what has been described as a &#8220;gross abuse of power&#8221; in its…</p>

<p></p>
<p>Secondly, the ruling raises serious questions about the SEC&#8217;s use of TROs. Judge Shelby&#8217;s criticism highlights a potential for abuse.</p>
<h2><strong>DEBT Box Fallout Sends Ripple Effects Across Crypto Industry</strong></h2>
<p>The fallout extends beyond Debt Box. Leading crypto companies like Coinbase, currently embroiled in their own legal battles with the SEC, are watching closely.</p>
<p>This decision could embolden them to challenge the SEC&#8217;s tactics more aggressively. More broadly, it may lead to increased scrutiny of Gensler&#8217;s regulatory approach.</p>
<p>Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal tweeted:</p>
<blockquote>
&#8220;The Commission just foisted a bill onto every one of us for their litigation misconduct,&#8221; reflecting the industry&#8217;s concern and frustration.
</blockquote>
<p>However, it&#8217;s crucial to note that the judge&#8217;s ruling doesn&#8217;t rule on the firm&#8217;s guilt or innocence regarding the alleged fraud. The lawsuit will continue. Furthermore, the impact on other ongoing SEC cases against crypto firms remains to be seen.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Whale Abruptly Moves 16,003 BTC After 5+ Years Silence</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/1-5-billion-bitcoin-leaves-coinbase-bullish-signal/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/1-5-billion-bitcoin-leaves-coinbase-bullish-signal/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。一只比特币鲸鱼突然在网络上转移了约16,003 BTC，这些比特币在休眠了五年以上后才动用。交易数据表明这笔交易涉及到一些非常古老的硬币。交易涉及的地址从5年到7年闭塞的比特币数量很大，价值约10.8亿美元。分析师发现这次交易与Coinbase有关，可能是资金的输出。这一举动可能预示着一个大型实体可能正在进行一些新的买入，并将硬币移至可能的自管式存储。最新的比特币价格在67,000美元左右交易。 <div>
<p>On-chain data shows a Bitcoin whale has suddenly moved around 16,003 BTC on the chain after staying dormant for more than five years.</p>
<h2>A Large Amount Of Dormant Bitcoin Has Just Moved On The Network</h2>
<p>As CryptoQuant community manager Maartunn pointed out in a <a href="https://twitter.com/JA_Maartun/status/1769443343237283932" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, the Bitcoin blockchain has recently processed a transaction involving some very old coins.</p>
<p>The indicator of interest here is the &#8220;<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-giant-awakens-whale-1000-btc-years-slumber/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Spent Output Age Bands</a>&#8221; (SOAB), which keeps track of the total amount of Bitcoin the different age bands in the market are now transferring on the network.</p>

<p>The age bands here refer to groups of coins divided based on holding time. The 1 day to 1 week age band, for example, includes all tokens that have been dormant for at least a day and at most a week.</p>
<p>In the context of the current discussion, the 5-year to 7-year age band is relevant. Below is the chart showing the SOAB data for this particular cohort.</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin SOAB" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="2580" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GI5TN0lW4AAInKx?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096" width="4096" /></p>

<p>It would appear that 16,003 BTC belonging to this age range have just been moved on the network. This stack would be worth around $1.08 billion at the current exchange rate.</p>
<p>Given the massive scale of the transfer, it&#8217;s likely that a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-soars-past-67000-as-whale-population-grows/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">whale</a> entity is involved here. As for why this investor has decided to break their long silence, it can be complicated.</p>
<p>Maartunn has done some additional sleuthing to find out more about the transfer. It would seem that the profit-to-loss ratio of this transfer was 15, which is quite the amount.</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Whale Profit" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="2580" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GI5TyM-W0AAZXP3?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096" width="4096" /></p>

<p>As the chart shows, there have been other recent transfers of dormant coins holding a comparable profit ratio, which means that this latest transaction isn&#8217;t exactly unique. However, the scale of the movie certainly makes it stand out more.</p>
<p>The analyst has found that the transaction is related to a Coinbase move. Below is the Bitcoin <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bullish-exchange-netflow-negative-spike/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">netflow</a> data for the exchange, which provides hints about the direction of this transfer.</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Coinbase Netflow" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="2580" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GI5Vg3tXoAAJNkM?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096" width="4096" /></p>

<p>CryptoQuant&#8217;s netflow metric would suggest that the transaction was an outflow, as the indicator&#8217;s value had turned negative. However, Maartunn isn&#8217;t sure whether it&#8217;s an outflow, saying, &#8220;I need more time to conclude whether this is a real outflow &#8211; eventually ETF related &#8211; or it&#8217;s just an internal flow.&#8221;</p>

<p>If it is indeed an outflow, it could be a bullish sign for Bitcoin, as it suggests a large entity is potentially participating in some fresh buying and then taking the coins off into possible self-custody.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>Bitcoin has gone through some notable drawdown over the past week as its price is now trading around $67,000.</p>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的<br />本周最新的钓鱼诈骗事件导致了近300万美元的损失，钓鱼者冒充知名加密交易者Ansem，窃取了260万美元。钓鱼者在交易者的帖子下发布了总共超过3百万美元的欺诈链接，受害者包括不明身份的用户和知名项目。社交媒体上充斥着冒充重要人物的假账户，试图欺诈加密用户。最近，许多项目在预售中筹集了数百万美元，吸引了许多投资者寻求巨额利润，这导致了更多的钓鱼活动。加密领域的盗窃事件仍然在摇撼着市场，加密用户必须警惕他们点击的链接，并采取足够的安全措施来保护他们的资金。 <div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Another start of the week, another crypto scam alert. This week’s latest phishing scam opened Pandora’s box of scamming tactics after almost $3 million was stolen by an impersonator pretending to be a top crypto trader.</p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto Scams, A Tale As Old As Time</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Whether prices are up or down, scammers are on the lookout for their next <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/new-crypto-heist-alert-hacker-drains-5-6m-from-data-storage-platform-wallet/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">big heist</a>, and this market slowdown was no exception.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto detective ZachXBT informed about the latest scamming attack over the weekend. The investigator shared that an account pretending to be renowned crypto trader Ansem (@blknoiz06 on X) phished over $2.6 million.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">An account impersonating <a href="https://twitter.com/blknoiz06?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">@blknoiz06</a> phished &gt;$2.6M today just by replying to each of his posts taking advantage of the recent meme coin craze. </p>
<p>The largest single victim lost ~$1.2M.</p>

<p></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Under the @blfnoiz06 username, the impersonating account replied to the trader’s X posts promoting a presale link that redirected users to a wallet drainer.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The scammer would announce under each post that he was about to &#8220;launch his token&#8221; $BULL, and the presale participants were required to send a minimum of 1 SOL and a maximum of 3 SOL.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Ironically, the scammer replied to one of Ansem’s posts where he stated, “I don’t launch coins bros.” As reported by the crypto detective, the largest victim lost $1.2 million worth of SOL. Hours after the report, an additional $250,000 had been stolen, raising the loot to almost $3 million.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Another ~$250K stolen since my post lol</p>

<p></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">When questioned whether these were real victims or scammers moving their stolen tokens around, ZachXBT confirmed that several victims, including the largest one, had messaged him to inform him of the scam.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Phishing In Troubled Waters</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Despite not being a new tactic, the number of phishing scams involving popular and influential actors in the crypto community appears to have increased recently.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Scrolling through social media, especially X, means seeing many accounts <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/deepfakes-use-buterins-image-in-sham-crypto-promo/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">pretending</a> to be important figures and trying to catch naive, greedy, or incautious users.</p>

<p></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The array of personalities and projects being taken advantage of goes from virtual artists to L2 NFT-focused blockchains to liquid re-staking protocols, as reported by the anti-scam platform.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Scammers appear to be trying to take advantage of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-meme-shiba-inu-dogecoin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">memecoin frenzy</a> that’s taking place. Recently, many projects have raised millions in presales, and many investors are looking for their next big profit. As a result, phishing in troubled waters becomes an easy task.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As seen in the dramatic launch of the Solana-based memecoin Slerf, impersonators tried to take advantage of the situation. They created an account pretending to represent the team behind the project.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This launch saw the accidental burn of the Liquidity pool (LP) and Presale airdrop SLERF tokens, which resulted in the loss of over $10 million raised by presale participants.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="crypto scam, solana, bitcoin, slerf" class="size-large wp-image-288048 aligncenter" height="658" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Captura-de-Pantalla-2024-03-18-a-las-11.50.02-a.-m.jpg?w=601&#038;resize=601%2C658" width="601" /></p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Responding to the real account, the impersonator claimed the mistake was “a joke” and provided a fraudulent link for presale investors to “claim” their tokens.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">These tactics have made many affected figures limit the people who can reply to their posts and issue warnings about the scam. Similarly, others have <a href="https://twitter.com/Slerfsol/status/1769621998068535694" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">chosen</a> to end their posts with an image disclosing that any other information or link below doesn’t come from them.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It’s worth noting that crypto heists continue to shake the crypto space, with <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-hacks-value-saw-97-in-february-investigator/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">millions lost</a>. Due to this, crypto users must be wary of the links they engage with and ensure they have taken enough security measures to safeguard their funds.</p>

<title>Binance Investigates 300M BOME Token Pre-Listing Purchase In Insider Trading Scandal</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/binance-investigates-300m-bome-token-pre-listing/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/binance-investigates-300m-bome-token-pre-listing/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的<br />加密货币交易所币安对Solana Book Of Meme（BOME）上市涉及内幕交易的指控进行了调查。BOME的市值从零迅速上升到超过20亿美元，引发了社区指控内幕交易的讨论。币安迅速回应了指控，启动了内部调查。同时，OKX交易所丰富自身列表的方式与币安不同，强调他们独立做出上市决定。交易所币安的币安币（BNB）在过去24小时下跌4.8％，交易停留在543美元。 <div>
<p>Crypto exchange Binance has investigated allegations of insider trading concerning the listing of Solana <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-implements-stricter-token-listing-procedure/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">meme coin</a> Book Of Meme (BOME). </p>
<h2>Binance Investigates Insider Trading Claims</h2>
<p>On March 14th, Pepe Meme artist Darkfarms introduced the Solana meme coin BOME. He initiated the token&#8217;s presale by sharing a Solana address on Twitter, where raised SOL funds were utilized to add <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/nigeria-crackdown-binance-authorities-demand/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">liquidity</a>. </p>
<p>Within three days, BOME <a href="https://wublock.substack.com/p/talk-with-bome-investor-flynngao?r=jbpop&amp;triedRedirect=true" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">skyrocketed </a>from zero to a peak market value of over $2 billion (currently valued at $700 million) and secured a listing on the Binance exchange. </p>
<p>However, before the listing of the meme coin, a whale &#8211; a person or entity that holds a large amount of crypto &#8211; <a href="https://twitter.com/ChainROI/status/1769045094458331525" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">purchased </a>314 million BOME tokens for $2.3 million on the Raydium decentralized exchange (DEX) on March 15, at an average price of $0.0074 per token. </p>
<p>After the listing, the token&#8217;s value skyrocketed to $0.026, making the purchased tokens worth approximately $5 million. This suspicious transaction triggered community discussions, with some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/1bguk21/comment/kv9v4dt/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">speculating </a>about the possibility of insider trading. </p>

<p>Binance promptly responded to the allegations by launching an internal investigation into the insider trading claims linked to BOME&#8217;s listing on their exchange. </p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/binancezh/status/1769596302323798256?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">statement</a>, Binance addressed the community&#8217;s concerns, stating that it takes such information seriously and is committed to conducting a thorough investigation. The exchange&#8217;s preliminary findings indicate that the individual named in the allegations has no connection to Binance.</p>
<p>Moreover, Binance expressed gratitude for the community&#8217;s vigilance and emphasized the importance of transparency and fairness. The exchange promised to continue investigating the matter in-depth to uncover the truth surrounding the allegations. </p>
<p>To encourage reporting any instances of currency quotation corruption or insider misconduct involving Binance team members, the exchange offered <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/changpeng-zhao-ordered-to-surrender-passport/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">financial rewards</a> ranging from $100,000 to $5 million while ensuring the confidentiality of the whistleblower&#8217;s identity.</p>
<p>According to CoinGecko <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/book-of-meme" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">data</a>, the BOME token currently trades at $0.01114, marking a significant 51% decline from its listing price and all-time high (ATH) of $0.02689. Additionally, the trading volume has decreased by 35%.</p>
<h2>OKX Founder Responds To Speculations</h2>
<p>In contrast to Binance, the second-largest offshore exchange, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/okx-approved-a-win-for-singapores-crypto-ambitions/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">OKX</a>, has not listed any recent Solana meme coins. The founder of OKX, StarXu, has responded to speculations regarding this matter. </p>
<p>StarXu <a href="https://x.com/star_okx/status/1769733521793536340?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">clarified </a>that the OKX listing team&#8217;s primary focus is to discover valuable and promising utility tokens for their customers at an early stage. Unlike some exchanges, OKX does not entertain requests or pitches for listings. </p>
<p>Instead, the founder of OKX stated that they thoroughly researched potential projects in the market and closely monitored the performance of the tokens over a long period. Final listing decisions are made independently by OKX&#8217;s <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/okx-probe-south-korea-alleged-crypto-violations/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Listing Committee</a>.</p>

<p>StarXu emphasized that repeatedly promoting or pushing tokens to OKX team members on Twitter will not influence the listing process in any way. He urged individuals to refrain from such activities and stated that they have no influence on the selection of tokens for listing on the OKX exchange.</p>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。知名加密货币分析师Willy Woo对比特币的未来进行了深入分析，提出了对该资产与黄金和美元这样的传统资产进行投资的可行性。他对BTC投资的风险/回报比进行了研究，并表示比特币有望明显超过黄金。其分析提出了三种可能的估值情景：实现“超级比特币化”、与美元相匹配以及超越黄金。同时，BTC市场正面临美联储等宏观因素的影响，尤其是即将宣布的联邦公开市场委员会（FOMC）会议，可能对比特币价格产生显著影响。总体而言，尽管最近出现了差距，比特币仍然表现出韧性，维持在66000美元以上的水平。 <div>
<p>Renowned crypto analyst Willy Woo has recently <a href="https://x.com/woonomic/status/1769535005384912931?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">delved</a> into the future of Bitcoin, providing an analysis that explores the asset&#8217;s investment viability against traditional assets like gold and the US dollar.</p>
<p>With over a decade of experience in the market, Woo&#8217;s insights offer a dive into the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-shake-up-galaxy-ceo-novogratz-warns-btc/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">possibilities</a> for the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency.</p>

<h2>Exploring Bitcoin&#8217;s Potential Valuations</h2>
<p>Examining the risk/reward ratio of BTC investment, Woo presents an optimistic outlook, suggesting that Bitcoin holds a significant chance of outperforming gold.</p>
<p>His analysis outlines three scenarios for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-coinbase-premium-deep-red-reason-crash/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin&#8217;s future valuation</a>: achieving &#8220;hyperbitcoinization&#8221; with a coin value of $4.8 million, matching the US dollar at $1 million per BTC, and surpassing gold with a valuation of $690,000 per coin.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Today that bet is:</p>
<p>$4.8m &#8211; hyperbitcoinisation
$1m &#8211; matches USD size
$690k &#8211; displaces gold</p>
<p>The payoff is 10x &#8211; 70x, now make your own guess at chances of success and bet accordingly.</p>
<p>— Willy Woo (@woonomic) <a href="https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1769535009080148183?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">March 18, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Woo&#8217;s forecasts suggest that the prospect of earning returns ranging from 1,000% to 7,000% draws the interest of those looking for advice on investing in BTC. However, he cautions investors to judge the potential success of cryptocurrencies and tailor their investment approaches as needed. Specifically, Woo noted</p>
<blockquote><p>For example if you think there’s more than 10% chance of BTC superceding gold, then it’s probably worth investing to get the 10x.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Macro Influences And Bitcoin&#8217;s Current State</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market, especially BTC, is on the verge of finding itself at the mercy of broader <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/jim-bianco-backs-vanguard-on-bitcoin-etfs-decision/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">economic decisions</a>, such as the upcoming announcement by the US Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>Prominent Chinese crypto journalist Colin Wu highlights the anticipation of the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, which could significantly influence Bitcoin&#8217;s price movements.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The Federal Reserve FOMC will announce its interest rate decision on March 20 this week, and Chairman Powell will give a speech. Currently, CME shows that the probability of keeping interest rates unchanged is as high as 99%. In addition, Switzerland, Australia, the United…</p>

<p>With expectations set on the Fed potentially maintaining interest rates, the decision could have far-reaching implications for BTC and the wider crypto market.</p>
<img alt="Bitcoin (BTC) price chart on TradingView" class="size-medium" height="1556" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/Eg8uvmHo/" width="2770" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite recent pullbacks that saw Bitcoin&#8217;s price decrease by nearly 10% over the past week, the cryptocurrency has shown resilience, maintaining its position above the $66,000 mark.</p>

<p>This recent dip, amid anticipation of the FOMC meeting and the upcoming BTC halving, illustrates the complex interplay between macroeconomic factors and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-hashrate-plunges-from-all-time-high-but-why/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">cryptocurrency valuations</a>.</p>

<title>Binance CEO Predicts Bitcoin Surging Beyond $80,000 Driven By ETF Inflows</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-surging-beyond-80000-driven-by-etf-inflows/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-surging-beyond-80000-driven-by-etf-inflows/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章首先介绍了比特币在过去5天内的波动情况，包括价格从历史最高点跌至更低水平，然后回升至68000美元以上。文章引用了Binance首席执行官Richard Teng的观点，表示比特币的价格将超过80000美元，归因于机构投资的增加。文章还提到了数字资产的大量流入，创下历史纪录，全球交易量达430亿美元，美国市场引领资金流入。总体来说，文章表明比特币和数字资产继续受到增长和投资者关注的推动。 <div>
<p>Over the past five days, Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency, has experienced a period of heightened volatility, triggering significant liquidations of leveraged positions as its price fluctuated wildly in hours. </p>
<p>After reaching an all-time high of $73,750 on Thursday, BTC experienced a<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-a-decades-long-investment-ceo-says-despite-recent-downturn/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> sharp decline </a>to $64,600 on Sunday. On Monday, at the start of the trading week, the cryptocurrency recaptured the $68,000 level. Nonetheless, it retraced over 2% shortly after, settling around the $66,800 mark.</p>
<p>Amidst this turbulent market activity, Binance Chief Executive Officer Richard Teng, as <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-17/binance-ceo-teng-sees-bitcoin-topping-80-000-on-etf-inflows" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reported </a>by Bloomberg, believes that Bitcoin&#8217;s record-breaking rally will persist, propelling its price beyond $80,000. </p>
<h2>Binance CEO Bullish On Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Teng attributes this expected surge to the increasing influx of institutional investment into the newly approved spot Bitcoin <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/jim-bianco-backs-vanguard-on-bitcoin-etfs-decision/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">exchange-traded funds</a> (ETFs), trading for just over two months. The introduction of Bitcoin ETFs in the United States earlier this year has attracted significant attention from institutional investors, resulting in new inflows.</p>

<p>Speaking at an event in Bangkok on Sunday, Teng stated that he originally estimated Bitcoin to hover around $80,000 by the end of the year. However, he now envisions the cryptocurrency surpassing that milestone due to reduced supply and sustained demand. </p>
<p>Teng emphasized that his forecast represents his viewpoint and acknowledged that the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-defi-tvl-rockets-80-impact-on-sol-price/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">rally </a>will not be linear. He believes the market&#8217;s ups and downs will ultimately benefit the entire ecosystem.</p>
<p>Lastly, Teng highlighted the continued inflow of funds into US spot Bitcoin ETFs since their approval in January. He expects more institutions and family offices to increase their allocations to Bitcoin ETFs shortly.</p>
<p>Richard Teng assumed the CEO role after Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) stepped down in November following Binance&#8217;s <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-ceo-to-step-down-4-billion-settlement/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">$4.3 billion settlement</a> with US authorities. </p>
<h2>Digital Asset Inflows Skyrocket </h2>
<p>In a recent blog <a href="https://blog.coinshares.com/volume-174-digital-asset-fund-flows-weekly-report-60801e380967" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, digital asset investment company CoinShares announced that digital asset investment products experienced a record weekly inflow, reaching $2.9 billion last week. </p>
<p>This surpasses the all-time high of $2.7 billion set the previous week. Furthermore, these inflows bring the year-to-date (YTD) total to an impressive $13.2 billion, surpassing the total inflows for all of 2021, which were $10.6 billion.</p>
<img alt="Bitcoin " class="size-large wp-image-288038" height="660" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot_79.jpg?w=669&#038;resize=669%2C660" width="669" />
<p>Trading volumes for the week amounted to $43 billion, matching the previous week&#8217;s record and accounting for 47% of the overall global Bitcoin volumes. </p>
<p>During this period, global exchange-traded products (ETPs) crossed the milestone of $100 billion for the first time. However, due to the<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/vanguard-ceo-double-down-on-anti-bitcoin-etf-stance/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> price correction</a> towards the end of the week, the total settled at $97 billion.</p>

<p>Regionally, the United States witnessed substantial inflows of $2.95 billion, while minor inflows were observed in Australia, Brazil, and Hong Kong, amounting to $5 million, $24 million, and $15 million, respectively. </p>
<p>Conversely, Canada, Germany, Sweden, and Switzerland experienced combined outflows of $78 million during the same week. On the other hand, the year has seen outflows of $685 million thus far.</p>
<p>Bitcoin dominated the inflows last week, securing $2.86 billion and accounting for 97% of all inflows year-to-date. Interestingly, short Bitcoin positions witnessed their largest inflows in a year, totaling $26 million, marking the fifth consecutive week of increased interest in this area.</p>

<title>Shiba Inu Team Shares Important Guide To Investing In Meme Coins</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-investing-meme-coins/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-investing-meme-coins/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章介绍了Shiba Inu的市场营销领导Lucie提供的关于模因币投资的全面指南，强调了风险并提供了投资者必须遵循的一些积极做法和消极做法。此外，文章还讨论了Shiba Inu如何从一个模因币发展为更多，包括独特的三令牌结构、社区和用途案例。Lucie对Shiba Inu的未来发展表示乐观，并指出其已跻身顶级11个替代加密货币之列。 <div>
<p>Popular Shiba Inu marketing lead, Lucie has <a href="https://x.com/lucieshib/status/1769573220510814587?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">unveiled</a> a comprehensive guide to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/can-meme-coins-make-you-a-millionaire-the-bitter-sweet-reality-of-investing-in-explosive-cryptos/">investing in meme coins</a>, offering detailed steps and emphasizing the risks associated with such ventures.</p>
<h2>Do’s And Don&#8217;ts Of Meme Coin Investing</h2>
<p>In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-team-next-big-thing-big-money-shib/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Lucie</a> revealed a blueprint for meme coin investments, providing a road map for investors and crypto enthusiasts looking to navigate this complex market. The SHIB influencer disclosed that meme coins should not be regarded as conventional investments, but rather as a fun venture within the cryptocurrency space.</p>

<p>She shared a screenshot outlining five essential aspects of meme coin investing, compiled by <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-team-1-2-million-burned/">Shiba Inu team member Da Vinci</a>. The first step of the guide highlighted the necessity of understanding the risks and high volatility characteristic of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/meme-coin-madness-sends-ethereum-fees-soaring/">meme coin market</a>, accentuating how these coins frequently undergo <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/can-doge-avoid-a-dive-sell-pressure-puts-memecoin-to-the-test/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">swift price fluctuations. </a></p>
<p>Lucie further disclosed how much meme coins were subservient to social media. According to the SHIB influencer, the price of meme coins is greatly influenced by intangible factors like <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/digitoads-races-towards-5-million-milestone-without-dogecoin-style-elon-musk-celebrity-endorsements/">celebrity endorsement</a> and social media trends. This highlights the possible absence of an intrinsic value in these coins, amplifying the potential for increased risks. </p>
<p>In stressing the dangers associated with <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solanas-biggest-memecoin-gains-681000-in-3-days-as-more-investors-bet-on-its-popularity/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">meme coin investments</a>, the Shiba Inu team has also provided important advice to investors looking into this market. They urge crypto enthusiasts to thoroughly understand the fundamental principles of a meme coin, along with its community dynamics and market trends, before making any investment decisions.</p>
<p>Further highlighting the need for risk mitigation, the team has stated the necessity of utilizing only expendable funds for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/top-meme-coin-to-surge-100x-post-bitcoin-halving/">meme coin</a> investments. They stressed the importance of responsible investing, urging investors to base their decisions on solid research rather than market hype. By adhering to these <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/guide-for-crypto-investors-7-memecoins-that-could-outperform-shiba-inu-in-2024/">guides</a>, investors may potentially avoid unnecessary risks in the market, while also optimizing their <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/3-meme-coins-you-should-have-in-your-portfolio-for-the-bull-run/">investment strategies</a>. </p>
<h2>Shiba Inu: More Than Just A Meme?</h2>
<p>Starting as a humorous project developed by an anonymous individual or group identified as “Ryoshi”, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-google-ai-price-shib/">SHIB</a> began its journey as a meme coin, distinguished by its speculative nature and comedic mascot inspired by the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/who-moved-1-trillion-shiba-inu-tokens-huge-transfer-raises-eyebrows/">Shiba Inu</a> dog breed. However, over the years, the cryptocurrency has been making serious efforts toward differentiating itself from others, adopting a unique three-token structure, cultivating a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bone-binance-shiba-inu-army-campaigns-for-listing/">vibrant community</a> and showcasing its versatile use cases.</p>

<p>In light of these developments, Lucie has <a href="https://x.com/lucieshib/status/1769577485123936423?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">boldly declared</a> in a recent X post, that SHIB has finally transcended the meme coin label. The Shiba Inu marketing influencer pointed out that the cryptocurrency has secured a position among the top 11 altcoins in the space, underscoring the token’s <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shibarium-new-record/">growing popularity</a> and possibly <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-price-0-0001-target/">promising trajectory</a>. </p>
<p>She has also expressed optimism concerning SHIB’s ability to evolve into a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/company/are-governance-tokens-the-future-of-defi/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">governance token</a>, potentially granting holders the opportunity to participate and vote on the decision-making processes of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-founder-end-vision/">Shiba Inu ecosystem.</a></p>

<div> 摘要：<br /><br />这些信息是积极的。伦敦的破产资产交易公司Attestor Ltd.从FTX加密交易所购买的加密资产价值暴涨，获得了巨大的利润。然而，Attestor购买的FTX账户的卖家Lemma Technologies选择保留索赔，引发法律纠纷。Lemma的主要投资者Bang面临盗用数字资产的指控。此外，涉及Haru Invest的另一案件也牵涉到Bang。这些法律纠纷的解决将影响各方的未来。 <div>
<p>London-based boutique distressed asset trading firm Attestor Ltd. experienced a significant bonanza as the value of crypto assets purchased from <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftxs-sam-bankman-fried-should-receive-50-year-jail/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s</a> FTX crypto exchange soared. </p>
<p>According to a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-18/london-fund-s-ftx-bankruptcy-windfall-mired-in-legal-battle" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, Attestor&#8217;s trade became the talk of distressed investing circles as profits multiplied at an astonishing rate &#8211; 50%, 100%, and even close to 200%.</p>
<h2>Multi-Million-Dollar Gain From FTX Bankruptcy Threatened</h2>
<p>As the value of crypto assets rose sharply, Attestor and other market participants reportedly seized the opportunity to purchase distressed assets at “rock-bottom prices” from Bankman-Fried&#8217;s clients seeking to recover their losses. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-drops-bombshell-lawsuit/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">bankruptcy proceedings</a> of FTX, Bankman-Fried&#8217;s cryptocurrency exchange, are projected to deliver investors the full amount of their frozen funds, estimated at 100% of the initial investment.</p>
<p>However, Attestor&#8217;s hold on its share of the windfall has become uncertain. The seller of one of the largest FTX accounts purchased by Attestor, an allegedly &#8220;obscure&#8221; Panamanian company called Lemma Technologies, controlled by a South Korean trader, has opted to keep the claim to itself, at least for now.</p>

<p>Attestor&#8217;s legal team argues in a New York court that this situation demonstrates &#8220;seller&#8217;s remorse.&#8221; The price <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/blockfi-resolves-dispute-with-ftx-alameda-research/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">agreed upon with Lemma in June 2023</a> was $58 million, but the claim&#8217;s current value is expected to reach $165 million. </p>
<p>Lemma, the Panamanian firm, has yet to publicly explain its position or respond to Attestor&#8217;s lawsuit in New York. Attestor&#8217;s attorneys assert that Lemma will only honor the trade confirmations if compelled to do so by the force of law.</p>
<p>Adding to the intrigue is that Lemma&#8217;s main investor, Junho Bang, is facing legal charges in a separate case in Seoul, South Korea. </p>
<h2>Embezzlement Charges</h2>
<p>Attestor agreed with Lemma in June to purchase a bundle of FTX claims, believed to be among the largest. With this year&#8217;s <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/incarcerated-sam-bankman-fried-promote-solana/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">cryptocurrency recovery </a>and successful asset recovery efforts, these claims are now set to pay out in full. </p>
<p>The attestor is reportedly eager to close the deal and is willing to &#8220;complete the transactions immediately.&#8221; However, Lemma&#8217;s Junho Bang appears to be in no hurry to do so, possibly due to his involvement in the separate crypto-lender Haru Invest case, according to Bloomberg.</p>
<p>Bang stands accused of “embezzling” digital assets from the lender and is currently facing charges by South Korean authorities. Although the Haru Invest case and the Attestor&#8217;s lawsuit over FTX claims are distinct, Bang is central to both matters.</p>

<p>During the cryptocurrency boom, Haru Invest allegedly offered “high returns,” but it eventually froze<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-founder-sam-bankman-fried-in-the-spotlight/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> customer redemptions</a>, citing issues with its service provider, B&amp;S Holdings, which allegedly provided false information. B&amp;S described itself as a quantitative trading company for crypto assets, including FTX&#8217;s FTT token.</p>
<p>As the legal proceedings continue, the resolution of these cases will shape the outcomes for the involved parties and shed light on the future dynamics of distressed investing in the crypto space.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Analyst Targets $500,000 But Warns of “Scary” Dips</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-targets-500000-scary-dips/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-targets-500000-scary-dips/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。一位加密分析师认为，到2025年中旬，比特币将达到50万美元。尽管价格走势上涨，但分析师预计会出现一些“可怕”的跌幅。尽管比特币价格在周末出现震荡，但分析师建议投资者保持信心，认为比特币价格会随着时间推移上涨。此外，比特币ETF的需求不断增加，预计价格将因激增的需求而上涨。不过，分析师警告投资者在未来可能面临惊人的价格波动，但应保持冷静。比特币价格仍然看涨，尤其是在比特币减半奖励之前。 <div>
<p>In a post on X, one crypto analyst thinks Bitcoin will reach $500,000 by mid-2025. However, even as prices trend higher, the rally won&#8217;t be smooth sailing, expecting some &#8220;scary&#8221; dips. </p>
<h2>Bitcoin Is Shaky</h2>
<p>The <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/bitcoinmunger/status/1769441980113691023" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">analysis</a> is when Bitcoin prices appear shaky, characterized by sharp corrections. Over the weekend, prices plunged lower, denting confidence after a weak conclusion on Friday. Prices are yet to recover, trending below the psychological $70,000 level.</p>
<img alt="Bitcoin on track to $500,000 | Source: Analyst on X" class="size-full wp-image-287989" height="690" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GI5RmqaX0AAP8Ro.jpg?resize=1024%2C690" width="1024" />
<p>Even amid this, the analyst says people should hold on tightly, relaying confidence that the only way for the world&#8217;s most valuable coin is up. To support this outlook, the analyst compares Bitcoin&#8217;s price action and the historical trajectory of gold following the launch of Gold exchange-traded funds (ETF). </p>
<p>At current rates, and despite the lull over the weekend, Bitcoin is outpacing gold&#8217;s historical growth pattern. This preview suggests that, like gold, Bitcoin could rally over time. From this projection, the analyst thinks not only will bulls shake off the current weakness but see prices rally nearly 7X from current rates to $500,000, following a similar path to gold&#8217;s trajectory.</p>

<p>Still, while the $500,000 target is undoubtedly enticing, the analyst warns investors to brace themselves for &#8220;scary falls&#8221; along the way. These dips, the analyst emphasizes, shouldn&#8217;t be misconstrued as signs of the end. Instead, they should be seen as a natural part of Bitcoin&#8217;s historical price action.</p>
<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/x/BfxVsiD9/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Bitcoin price trending upward on the daily chart | Source: BTCUSDT on Binance, TradingView" class="size-full" height="904" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/BfxVsiD9/" width="1787" /></a>
<p>Despite the expected volatility, the analyst urges investors to &#8220;stay calm&#8221; now and in the future in the face of anticipated price drops. After sharp expansions over the past few trading weeks, there could be suggestions that the coin has peaked, and prices are likely to correct in the cool-off. </p>
<h2>Demand From Spot ETFs Ahead Of Halving</h2>
<p>Although it may be accurate, the rate at which Bitcoin ETF issuers purchase BTC for their clients is positive for the market. In a post on X, an analyst observes that the amount of spot Bitcoin ETF inflows within a month is comparable to a year of Gold ETF inflows. </p>
<p>This analysis suggests that the demand for BTC is way higher. Accordingly, prices may respond by rallying in the face of surging demand.</p>

<p>Bitcoin remains bullish, less than a month before the protocol halves <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-price-correct-after-halving/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">miner</a> rewards. Supporters are adamant that in the next epoch, considering the current level of demand, there will be a supply crisis. In that case, BTC prices might remain high.</p>

<title>US Treasury Approved Exchange Announces XRP Listing</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/us-treasury-exchange-xrp/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/us-treasury-exchange-xrp/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的<br />法官Analisa Torres判定XRP不属于证券后，XRP价格有望继续上涨。美国财政部批准的交易所Atlantis Exchange宣布将上市XRP。该交易所对XRP的快速跨境交易能力表示赞赏，并预测其价格可能会增长100倍。此外，XRP目前价格为$0.611，市值为$33.48亿，位列第6。交易所开放了XRP的存款和交易，但暂未集成原生区块链。 <div>
<p class="p2">The XRP price could be headed for greater heights with the latest development coming out of the community. While <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-scores-win-endorsed-as-non-security-status/">the altcoin</a> has been trading on leading crypto exchanges since Judge Analisa Torres’s rules that programmatic sales did not qualify as securities sale, it has moved a step forward with an announcement from an exchange approved by the United States Treasury Department.</p>
<h2 class="p2">XRP Debuts On US Treasury-Approved Exchange</h2>
<p class="p2">On Saturday, March 16, Atlantis Exchange <a href="https://x.com/Atlantis_Ex/status/1769207654365196413?s=20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> that it would be listing XRP for trading. This listing is significant to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-ceo-success-for-xrp/">the altcoin</a> because Atlantis Exchange is one of the few exchanges for trading cryptocurrencies that have been registered with not only the United States Treasury, but also the United Nations.</p>

<p class="p2">This listing puts XRP among around 50 cryptocurrencies which are currently trading on the platform. Deposits for users were opened on March 13, and trading on the platform officially began on Monday, March 17. Trading is also expecting to carry on for three days before users will be able to withdraw <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-analyst-bullish-on-ethereum-and-xrp/">XRP tokens</a> from the exchange, which will open on March 20.</p>
<p class="p2">Additionally, the network for depositing XRP to the crypto exchange is the BSC network. This means that users who want to send tokens to Atlantis need to make sure that they are actually using the BSC network to transfer the tokens. Otherwise, they could end up losing their coins. The crypto exchange is yet to integrate the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-advocate-goes-big-500000-pledged-for-senate-campaign-vs-us-senator/">XRP Ledger</a> on the platform, which means transactions cannot be carried out to and from the exchange using the native blockchain.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Nothing But Praise</h2>
<p class="p2">In the posts announcing the listing of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-price-to-hit-3-4-crypto-expert-reveals-when/">XRP token</a>, Atlantis Exchange also took time out to praise the cryptocurrency. The exchange outlines the fact that the token is used for cross-border transactions, highlighting its ability to confirm transactions in 3-5 seconds.</p>

<p class="p2">The exchange also sees a bright future for the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-etf-is-around-the-corner-uphold-research-chief/">XRP price</a>. In its post announcing the listing of XRP for trading, Atlantis Exchange predicted that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-price-to-hit-3-4-crypto-expert-reveals-when/">the altcoin’s price</a> could rise another 100x. Now, the feasibility of this is questionable, but it does show that Atlantis does believe that the altcoin will do well going forward.</p>
<p class="p2">As for the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-analyst-bullish-on-ethereum-and-xrp/">token&#8217;s price</a>, it is seeing a slow start to the week with light gains of 0.42% over the last day. However, its current trading value of $0.611 means that the coin is down 2.54% in the last week. Nevertheless, it remains the 6th-largest cryptocurrency in the space with a market cap of $33.48 billion.</p>

<title>Why Bitcoin Halving Could Bring Uncertainty To Mining Industry: An In-Depth Analysis</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/why-bitcoin-halving-could-bring-uncertainty-to-mining-industry/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要: 这些信息是积极的。文章讨论了即将到来的比特币减半事件对矿工收入和网络安全的影响。减半将导致收入减少50%，可能使一些操作不盈利。然而，价格上涨和交易费增加可能抵消收入减少，维持挖矿动力。此外，减少供应和增加需求可能有助于挖矿行业的发展。在挖矿技术创新和清洁能源的进一步利用下，操作成本可能会降低，环境可持续性可能会得到改善。最后，金融产品和机构投资能够稳定市场。 <div>
<p>As the countdown to the fourth Bitcoin halving approaches, scheduled around April 19th, 2024, miners are bracing for significant changes in their operations. The halving, which occurs approximately every four years, marks a pivotal event in Bitcoin&#8217;s economic landscape, impacting both miners&#8217; revenues and the network&#8217;s security.</p>
<p>Currently, miners receive 6.25 bitcoins as a reward for each validated block. However, with the upcoming halving, this reward will be slashed by half, dropping to 3.125 bitcoins per block. This abrupt reduction in revenue poses challenges for miners, particularly those operating on narrow profit margins.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.bitfinex.com/announcements/anatomy-of-the-halving-part-2-block-reward-and-network-security-navigating-the-new-economic-landscape/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">According to a report by cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex,</a> The halving&#8217;s immediate effect is a 50% decline in miners&#8217; income, which could render some operations unprofitable unless mitigated by an equivalent rise in Bitcoin&#8217;s price or reductions in operational costs. The subsequent strain might force less efficient miners out of the market, potentially contracting the network&#8217;s hashing power temporarily.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-287977" height="303" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_00544d.png?resize=542%2C303" width="542" /></p>
<h2><strong>Bitcoin Halving And The Challenge Of Network Security</strong></h2>
<p>Moreover, the reduced block reward raises concerns about Bitcoin&#8217;s network security and the potential for increased centralization of mining power. The network relies on decentralized miners to validate transactions and secure the blockchain.</p>
<blockquote>
“Centralization risks could mean the potential censorship of transactions and increased vulnerability to coordinated attacks or regulatory pressures,” Bitfinex said.
</blockquote>
<p>However, a decrease in rewards, without compensatory factors like increased Bitcoin prices or transaction fees, might disincentivize mining activities among smaller miners, leading to a consolidation of mining power among larger, more resourceful entities. This concentration of power could pose <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-halving-questioned-by-this-expert/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">risks to Bitcoin&#8217;s decentralized nature</a>, potentially enabling censorship of transactions and increasing vulnerability to coordinated attacks or regulatory pressures.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/AoJHf19j/" width="1835" /></p>

<p>Historically, halvings have spurred price rallies in Bitcoin due to increased scarcity. If this trend persists, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-50-drop-possible-ahead-of-halving/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">appreciating value of Bitcoin</a> could counterbalance reduced  block rewards, sustaining miner incentives and bolstering network security. However, this outcome hinges on several factors, including market demand and macroeconomic conditions.</p>
<p>Regulatory scrutiny adds another layer of complexity to the mining industry&#8217;s future. Governments worldwide, including the Biden administration in the US and various EU nations, are eyeing stricter regulations on Bitcoin mining due to environmental concerns.</p>
<h2><strong>Potential Outcomes And Strategies Post-Bitcoin Halving</strong></h2>
<p>The proposed Bitcoin mining energy tax in the US aims to generate substantial revenue, projected at nearly $10 billion in 2025 and over $42 billion in the next decade. If enacted, this tax could reshape the economic landscape for Bitcoin mining in the US, compelling industry players to adopt more energy-efficient technologies or relocate to less regulated jurisdictions.</p>

<p>Despite these challenges, there are potential beneficial outcomes for the mining industry after the bitcoin halving event. A significant<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-to-reach-100k-in-2024/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> price increase in Bitcoin,</a> driven by reduced supply and growing demand, could offset reduced block rewards, maintaining or even increasing mining profitability.</p>
<p>Continued innovation in mining technology, coupled with access to cheaper and cleaner energy sources, could lower operational costs and improve environmental sustainability.</p>
<p>Furthermore, expansion into new regions with abundant renewable energy could diversify industry risks and enhance resilience. Increased transaction fees, driven by higher demand and efficiency improvements, could also supplement miners&#8217; revenue.</p>
<p>Institutional investment and the development of innovative financial products could stabilize the market and further integrate Bitcoin into the global financial system.</p>

<title>Ex-Coinbase CTO Urges ‘Vote for Bitcoin’: Why It Matters</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/ex-coinbase-cto-vote-for-bitcoin/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章中主要要点包括：巴拉吉·斯里尼瓦桑在社交媒体上呼吁支持比特币；将比特币与美元的竞争视为全球意义重大的决定；强调比特币的透明性和抗干预性；对比特币市场的发展和投资前景进行观察；指出比特币对传统金融秩序的冲击；预测比特币引起地缘政治和社会变革可能引发的冲突。文章以比特币目前的交易价格为结尾。 <div>
<p>In a thought-provoking statement on X (formerly Twitter), Balaji Srinivasan, the former Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at Coinbase and a notable figure in the venture capital world through his tenure at Andreessen Horowitz, stirred the crypto community and beyond with a bold proclamation: &#8220;VOTE FOR BITCOIN.&#8221; Srinivasan, leveraging his considerable influence in the tech and crypto spheres, articulated a vision that extends beyond mere investment advice, framing the choice between BTC and the US dollar (USD) as a pivotal global referendum.</p>
<p>He argued, &#8220;The real election is BTC vs USD, the primaries have already started across the world, and every ballot counts. So make sure to vote early and often. [&#8230;] The USD/BTC exchange rate is the one financial indicator that DC can’t fake,&#8221; highlighting the intrinsic transparency and resistance to manipulation Bitcoin offers compared to traditional financial metrics vulnerable to distortion by central authorities like the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/us-crypto-industry-major-victory-federal-reserve/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Federal Reserve</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

Here's why this is more… <a href="https://t.co/qrLWEXgxvs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://t.co/qrLWEXgxvs</a> <a href="https://t.co/ZOjVokzy02" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/ZOjVokzy02</a></p>

<p></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Vs. The US-Dollar: The Real Election</h2>
<p>Srinivasan&#8217;s assertion underscores a growing distrust in the mechanisms of traditional financial regulation and the authenticity of Bitcoin. He further emphasized the significance of recent legal and regulatory developments, particularly pointing to the August 29, 2023, ruling in the Grayscale case as a watershed moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Since they can&#8217;t fake the price of Bitcoin, the only thing the tradfi system could do is try to block the exit from dollars to Bitcoin. Which is why the SEC fought against ETF access for ten years. They finally lost on Aug 29, 2023 [&#8230;] this <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/breaking-grayscale-scores-victory-against-us-sec-spot-bitcoin-etf-imminent/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">court decision</a> is important because it opened the floodgates, allowing value to flow towards the Bitcoin ledger — and away from DC&#8217;s control,&#8221; he noted, suggesting the decision&#8217;s potential to catalyze a more widespread migration of value to BTC.</p>
<p>The conversation around Bitcoin&#8217;s resilience against governmental control is a central theme in Srinivasan&#8217;s discourse. He contends that BTC exists on a ledger beyond the federal government&#8217;s reach, making it inherently resistant to &#8220;freeze, seize, inflate, or confiscate&#8221; tactics that can be employed against more conventional assets. This characteristic of Bitcoin, according to Srinivasan, not only protects individual wealth but also signals a broader shift in how value is stored and exchanged.</p>
<p>Srinivasan&#8217;s insights extend to the investment landscape, where he claims, &#8220;Bitcoin&#8217;s incentives were strong enough to recruit not just <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-private-bitcoin-event/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">BlackRock</a>, but Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, and a critical mass of major firms.&#8221; This comment speaks to the BTC&#8217;s performance and its emerging role as a necessary component of diversified investment portfolios. He provocatively suggests that absence from the Bitcoin market might soon be seen as a strategic misstep, indicating the growing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies as legitimate assets.</p>

<p>Addressing the broader implications of BTC&#8217;s ascendancy, Srinivasan paints a vivid picture of a shifting economic order. &#8220;Its vertical rise signals that something is wrong in the legacy economy [&#8230;] telling you that the smart money no longer has full faith and confidence in fiat,&#8221; he asserts. This observation not only critiques the current state of traditional finance but also posits Bitcoin as a beacon of market sentiment, indicating broader economic trends and concerns.</p>
<p>Perhaps most compellingly, Srinivasan delves into the geopolitical and social dimensions of BGC&#8217;s rise. He foresees potential conflict as traditional power structures react to the decentralizing force of Bitcoin. &#8220;Just visualize&#8230;BLM/antifa/Hamas mobs&#8230;except this time with the support of blue-controlled police and military,&#8221; he speculates, drawing parallels between historical crackdowns on dissent and what he perceives as the inevitable backlash against Bitcoin&#8217;s disruption of established financial and political norms.</p>
<p>In concluding his thorough exposition, Srinivasan encapsulates the essence of his argument: &#8220;So: that&#8217;s why BTC vs USD is the real election.&#8221; This statement elevates the discourse surrounding BTC from technical and financial considerations to a philosophical and political declaration.</p>
<p>For Srinivasan, the choice between Bitcoin and traditional fiat currencies like the USD transcends conventional economic debates, embodying a critical juncture in the evolution of global finance and governance. Through his detailed and evocative commentary, Srinivasan not only champions Bitcoin as a superior asset but also as a symbol of a broader movement towards transparency, autonomy, and resistance against centralized control.</p>
<p>At press time, BTC traded at $67,464.</p>

<title>Is FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried Ditching Prison? Lawyers Reveal Daring Next Steps</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-prison-2/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-prison-2/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。文章揭示了前FTX交易所首席执行官Sam Bankman-Fried为避免监禁制定的计划，包括公开表明自己是共和党人，指责律师，发表强烈的反对币安的言论。检察官要求法院判处SBF 40至50年监禁，表示此处罚将反映出被告行为的严重性。辩护律师则提出将其判处5至6年半监禁，称外界会比监狱更需要他。司法部承认终身监禁对被告来说过于严厉，但也强调不要求法院判处终身监禁。 <div>
<p>A recent <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940.410.3_1.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">court filing</a> revealed plans that the former CEO of the defunct crypto exchange FTX, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-collapse-sam-bankman-fried-trial/">Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF)</a>, had drafted to ensure he avoids jail term. SBF, whose sentencing comes up on March 28, faces the possibility of spending up to 100 years locked behind bars. </p>
<h2>How Bankman-Fried Intended To Avoid Prison</h2>
<p>As part of his plans to avoid a jail term, Sam <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sam-bankman-fried-charges/">Bankman-Fried</a> included going on Tucker Carlson and coming out as a Republican. This formed part of what Sam Bankman-Fried had termed “probably bad ideas” in the Google doc, which contained a long list of things he planned to do to save face. </p>

<p>The FTX founder was publicly known to have made <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/breaking-news-ticker/ftxs-sbf-hit-with-fresh-batch-of-bank-fraud-charges/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">significant political donations</a> to the Democratic party while secretly funneling funds to the GOP. However, from his plan, SBF seemed to have believed that publicly coming out as a Republican would have helped his case more. He also planned to come out against the “woke agenda,” as Republicans are known to be conservatives. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, there were earlier reports that Bankman-Fried would blame all his lawyers as <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-execs/">part of his defense</a>. This was indeed true, as the convicted crypto founder contemplated this, highlighting in the Google doc how he would paint them as incompetent. SBF also planned to make everyone believe that this “cartel of lawyers” was why they failed in running FTX. </p>
<p>Bankman-Fried also thought putting out a “strong anti-Binance message” could help his case. The FTX founder may have indeed carried out this plan, as a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/is-sbf-behind-binance-negative-news/">Bitcoinist report</a> revealed how he might have been responsible for the negative news that gripped the largest crypto exchange last year. </p>
<h2>Prosecutors Ask For 40-50 Years For Sam Bankman-Fried</h2>
<p>As revealed in their <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940.410.0_2.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">sentencing submission</a>, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/us-government-bitcoin-holdings/">Department of Justice (DOJ)</a> has asked the court to sentence SBF to 40 to 50 years in prison, labeling it “necessary.” They noted that such punishment would reflect the seriousness of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-convicted/">Bankman-Fried’s crimes</a> and protect the public from further crimes of the defendant.  </p>

<p>The defendant’s lawyers had <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-fraud/#:~:text=Bankman%2DFried&#039;s%20Lawyers%20Propose%20A,six%20and%20a%20half%20years).">earlier proposed</a> a sentencing limit of 5 years to 6 and a half years, arguing that their client would be more useful in the outside world than in prison. However, the prosecution rebutted this submission and argued that such a sentence would be “woefully inadequate to satisfy the purposes of sentencing.”</p>
<p>Interestingly, the DOJ acknowledged that a life sentence for Sam Bankman-Fried would be “greater than necessary” to satisfy the sentencing guidelines, especially considering the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/prison-ftx-sam-bankman-fried/">defendant’s age</a>. As such, they emphasized that they weren’t asking the court to impose a life sentence. </p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章指出，中国的加密货币投资者在2023年度超越全球其他国家，实现了115亿美元的盈利。尽管中国政府对加密货币活动实施了严格限制，但中国投资者展现出了坚韧不拔的精神。美国在全球市场中占据主导地位，投资者获得94亿美元的收益。此外，亚洲地区继续在加密货币领域发挥重要作用，预示着数字资产类别前景光明。2024年的前几个月显示出了有望实现2021年高峰收益的趋势，尽管中国当局提醒投资者加密货币市场仍具有波动性和监管审查。 <div>
<p>Cryptocurrency investors in China have defied government restrictions to emerge as the<a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/cryptocurrency-gains-by-country-2023/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> fourth-largest earners</a> globally in 2023, according to a report by blockchain research firm Chainalysis.</p>
<p>Despite the government&#8217;s stringent stance on cryptocurrency-related activities, Chinese investors managed to accumulate an impressive $1.15 billion in gains, contributing to a total global crypto earnings of nearly $38 billion.</p>

<p>This resurgence marks a significant recovery from the previous year&#8217;s losses and underscores the enduring interest in virtual assets within China.</p>

<h2><strong>China&#8217;s Crypto Resilience</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3255699/chinas-cryptocurrency-investors-record-gains-more-us1-billion-2023-despite-sweeping-government-ban" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">China&#8217;s performance</a> in the cryptocurrency market stands out given the country&#8217;s strict regulations and bans on cryptocurrency trading and mining.</p>
<p>The success of Chinese crypto enthusiasts highlights a resilient and determined community that continues to find ways to engage in the digital asset space.</p>
<h2><strong>Global Market Trends</strong></h2>
<p>The overall cryptocurrency market experienced a rollercoaster ride in 2023, with earnings remaining steady throughout the year until a dip in August and September.</p>
<p>However, the market quickly rebounded, with November and December witnessing a surge in earnings that surpassed all previous months.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/SFF8tapd/" width="1835" /></p>

<strong>US Dominance And Hong Kong&#8217;s Market</strong>
<p>The United States maintained its dominance in the global cryptocurrency market, with American investors securing an estimated $9.4 billion in gains, far exceeding other countries.</p>
<p>In comparison, investors in the United Kingdom, the second-highest-earning nation, collectively made nearly $1.4 billion.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China, also saw a lively cryptocurrency market, with investors securing <a href="https://chinaeconomicreview.com/mainland-china-crypto-investors-made-1bn-in-2023-despite-ban/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">$250 million in gains.</a></p>

<title>Bitcoin Hashrate Plunges From All-Time High, But Why?</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-hashrate-plunges-from-all-time-high-but-why/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-hashrate-plunges-from-all-time-high-but-why/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。最近比特币挖矿算力急剧下降，导致了7天平均比特币挖矿算力的新高峰。这种下降可能是由于比特币价格下跌导致的挖矿收入下降，挖矿难度创新高以及即将到来的减半事件引起的。挖矿者可能会因此选择离开网络，以避免损失。当前比特币价格约为68000美元，过去一周下跌5%。 <div>
<p>On-chain data shows the Bitcoin mining hashrate has registered a plunge from the fresh all-time high (ATH) it had just recently set.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Mining Hashrate Has Dived Down Recently</h2>
<p>As the Bitcoin network works on the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-proof-of-work-fork-dates-unveiled/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">proof-of-work (PoW)</a> consensus mechanism, validators called miners have to compete with each other using computing power to get a chance to add the next block to the chain.</p>
<p>The total measure of this computing power that&#8217;s currently connected to the BTC blockchain is known as the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-hashrate-rebounds-smashes-all-time-high/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">&#8220;mining hashrate</a>.&#8221; This metric can directly correlate to the security of the network, since if a malicious entity has to succeed in an attack, it has to take over at least 51% of the total computing power.</p>

<p>Naturally, when the hashrate goes up, so does the resistance of the blockchain, as there is more machines to hack before the 51% target can be achieved. This is only, of course, given that the new hashrate being added is sufficiently decentralized.</p>
<p>Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 7-day average Bitcoin mining hashrate over the past year:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Bitcoin Mining Hashrate" class="alignnone wp-image-287897 size-large" height="411" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/chart_cab8de.png?resize=980%2C411" width="980" /></p>

<p>As displayed in the above graph, the 7-day average Bitcoin mining hashrate set a new ATH just a few days back. Since then, though, the indicator&#8217;s value has plunged down.</p>
<p>This decline would suggest that some miners have decided to disconnect from the blockchain. As for why this drop in the metric has occurred, there are likely to be a few reasons contributing to the trend.</p>
<p>The first and perhaps the most obvious is the fact that the Bitcoin price itself has plummeted from its latest high. Miners get their revenue from two sources, the block rewards and transaction fees, but the former is the one that makes up for the majority of their income.</p>
<p>The block rewards also happen to remain fixed in their BTC value, meaning that their USD value is really the only variable for the revenue of the miners as a whole. Obviously, when the asset&#8217;s price goes up, so does the value of these rewards.</p>
<p>With the recent price drop, the miner revenue has also tumbled in value. The miners who were already observing thin margins, like those situated in places with high electricity prices, may have decided it&#8217;s not worth staying connected to the network after the price drawdown.</p>
<p>At the same time as the crash has hit, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-mining-difficulty-soars-7-what-does-it-mean/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">mining difficulty</a> has also shot up to a new ATH. The difficulty is a feature of the Bitcoin network that controls how hard miners would find it to mine on the network.</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Difficulty" class="alignnone wp-image-287898 size-large aligncenter" height="413" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/chart_117c6b.png?resize=980%2C413" width="980" /></p>

<p>The concept of mining difficulty exists so as to ensure that miners can&#8217;t just add extra computing power to the chain to mine new blocks faster and receive new rewards faster.</p>
<p>The implication of the difficulty is that any new hashrate added to the network is essentially new competition for the existing hashrate, as they all compete for the same fixed BTC rewards. With the difficulty now at an ATH, miners&#8217; individual revenues would have naturally taken a hit.</p>

<p>Lastly, there is also the fact that the next halving, an event where BTC&#8217;s block rewards would be permanently slashed in half, is also due next month, which would drastically affect the miners&#8217; income.</p>
<p>Miners around the world would be coming up with strategies to deal with the halving and for some, it may even mean leaving the network behind, at least for now.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $68,000, down 5% over the past week.</p>

<title>Shiba Inu Burn Rate Sees Incredible 2,300% Increase In One Day – Details</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-burn-rate-2300/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-burn-rate-2300/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的<br />最近，Shiba Inu的销毁率激增，导致SHIB价格大幅反弹。在过去24小时内，Shibburn的数据显示，SHIB销毁数量增长了超过2300％，为195百万个SHIB代币。此举带来了SHIB价格的恢复，之前曾因一波利润回吐而受到打击。同时，Shibarium也似乎开启了其模因币季节，并可能对SHIB价格产生重要影响。Lucie还警告投资者谨慎投资模因币，并建议只用可承受损失的零花钱来投资。截至撰写时，SHIB的价格为$0.00002845，过去24小时涨幅达到了14%。 <div>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-burns-bright-shib/">Shiba Inu (SHIB) burns</a> are again the major talking point in the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/new-shiba-inu-ecosystem-token-march-7/">meme coin’s ecosystem </a>following a recent surge in the burn rate. This has also led to a massive rebound for SHIB’s price, which suffered a sharp correction in the past week due to a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-pepe-whales-sold/">wave of profit-taking</a>.</p>
<h2>Shiba Inu Burns Increase By Over 2,300%</h2>
<p>According to Shiba Inu’s burn tracker, Shibburn, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-8-billion-shib-burned/#:~:text=Over%208%20Billion%20Shiba%20Inu%20Burned%20In%20The%20Last%2024%20Hours&amp;text=As%20a%20result%20of%20this,transferred%20to%20a%20dead%20wallet." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">SHIB’s burn rate</a> increased by over 2,300% in the last 24 hours, with 195 million SHIB tokens burned during this period. This development has also provided a much-needed recovery to the meme coin’s price, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-whale-dumps-substantial-holdings-on-the-market-heres-how-much/#:~:text=Dogecoin%20Whale%20Offloads%2086%20Million,meme%20coin&#039;s%20recent%20price%20surge.">which declined by over 18%</a> last week. </p>

<p>SHIB has <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-shib-0-0008-ath/#:~:text=SHIB&#039;s%20all%2Dtime%20high%20(ATH,a%20new%20ATH%20very%20possible." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">been on the rise</a> in the past few weeks, even climbing to the number 10 spot of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-dogecoin-shib-excitement/">largest crypto tokens</a> by market cap. However, its run was halted last week by a wave of profit-taking from crypto whales who saw the meme coin’s recent price surge as an avenue to profit from their investment in the crypto token. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the recent increase in the burn rate and SHIB’s price reacting positively to it will undoubtedly excite the SHIB community, especially as the broader crypto market continues to lag. Shiba Inu’s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-lead-dev-shib-bull/">boldly claimed</a> that the meme coin would lead this bull market, and SHIB’s price recovering nicely after every dip can help strengthen that narrative. </p>
<h2>Shibarium Also Having Its Meme Season?</h2>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shib-2024/">Shiba Inu’s Marketing Lead, Lucie</a>, recently <a href="https://x.com/LucieSHIB/status/1769565972841607589?s=20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">hinted</a> at a meme coin season brewing on the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shibarium-public/">layer-2 network, Shibarium</a>. She added that the SHIB ecosystem has had success with memes, seeing how tokens like <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shibarium-shiba-inu-price/">SHIB, BONE, and LEASH</a> have experienced impressive growth since launching. </p>

<p>Shibarium&#8217;s meme coin season could be very significant for SHIB’s price in the short term, given the impact that Solana’s meme coin season has had on the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-price-2-year-high/">SOL token</a>. Shibarium seeing more traders invest in memes on the network would increase network activity and ultimately cause more SHIB tokens to be burned. <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bone-binance-shiba-inu-army-campaigns-for-listing/">BONE, Shibarium’s utility token</a>, will also benefit from such development. </p>
<p>Lucie was also quick to <a href="https://x.com/LucieSHIB/status/1769573220510814587?s=20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">warn</a> traders about the risk involved in investing in meme coins, noting that they shouldn’t be taken as “serious investments.” Therefore, she advised them against selling their investments to invest in memes. Instead, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-meme-coin-trader/">meme trading</a> should only be done with pocket money that one can afford to lose, Lucie added. </p>
<p>At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.00002845, up by 14% in the last 24 hours according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/shiba-inu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">data</a> from CoinMarketCap. </p>

<title>Weekly Crypto Preview: Major Events And Trends To Watch</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/weekly-crypto-preview-major-events-trends/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/weekly-crypto-preview-major-events-trends/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。<br />本周比特币和加密市场将受到几个关键事件的影响，如中央银行利率决定、Nvidia GTC会议和Etherfi的推出。中央银行利率决定可能影响比特币和其他加密货币，特别是美联储的决定。Nvidia GTC会议将提升几个以人工智能为重点的加密货币的地位，如NEAR和Render。此外，Etherfi推出ETHFI代币，通过液态重新抵押协议，用户可以在不锁定资产的情况下获得以太坊的利息奖励。 <div>
<p>This week in the Bitcoin and crypto markets is marked by several pivotal events that could significantly influence investor sentiment and market dynamics. Among them, central bank interest rate decisions, the Nvidia GTC conference, and the launch of Etherfi are particularly noteworthy. Below is an in-depth preview of these events and their potential impact on the crypto landscape.</p>
<h2>#1 FOMC Meeting Looming: How Will Bitcoin And Crypto React?</h2>
<p>Central banks representing nearly half of the global economy are slated to announce key interest rate decisions this week, affecting six of the ten most traded currencies. This series of decisions, the largest so far for 2024, includes announcements from the United States, Switzerland, Australia, the United Kingdom, Japan, among others.</p>
<img alt="Central bank decisions this week" class="size-full wp-image-287870" height="508" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GI4FCFCWwAAI3n4.png?resize=823%2C508" width="823" />
<p>These moves could indicate how central bankers perceive the current risk of inflation, with significant implications for the<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dollar-currency-index-dxy-crypto-bitcoin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> US dollar index (DXY)</a> and, inversely, for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The highlight of the week is the US Federal Reserve&#8217;s interest rate decision on Wednesday, March 20. Interest rates are expected to remain at their current level, with a 98% probability, as per the CME Fed Watch tool.</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs noted in a research <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeZaccardi/status/1769482598537904259" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">memo</a>, “Inflation has been firmer in recent months [&#8230;] We now expect 3 cuts in 2024, mainly because of the slightly higher inflation path [&#8230;] We suspect that the Fed leadership is also still targeting a first cut in June.” This narrative underscores a cautious approach to rate adjustments, reflecting a nuanced understanding of current economic indicators and their potential impact.</p>
<p>This upcoming FOMC meeting is particularly significant for the crypto market. Recently, the correlation between the Bitcoin and crypto market with the broader macroeconomic factors has strengthened, highlighted by Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies&#8217; price movements in reaction to<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-rockets-to-new-all-time-high-amid-cpi-surge-and-elon-musks-crypto-critique-of-dxy/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> hotter-than-expected US CPI and PPI data.</a> The anticipation of the “higher for longer” interest rates by the US Fed has led to market volatility, underscoring the importance of this week&#8217;s FOMC meeting for digital assets.</p>
<h2>#2 Nvidia GTC: NEAR, Render (RNDR) And AI Coins On The Rise</h2>
<p>The Nvidia GTC conference, a pivotal event for AI and GPU computing enthusiasts, is poised to elevate the profiles of several AI-focused cryptocurrencies. Notably, RNDR, NEAR, TAO, and FET have seen significant price movements in anticipation of the conference.</p>

<p><strong>NEAR In Focus: </strong>NEAR Protocol, a high-performance blockchain designed to provide the infrastructure for decentralized applications, has seen its native token NEAR surge by 125% in the last two weeks.</p>
<p>This uptick is largely attributed to the growing excitement over Nvidia&#8217;s annual conference, where Illia Polosukhin, co-founder and CEO of NEAR Protocol, is scheduled to appear on a panel titled &#8220;Transforming AI,&#8221; hosted by Nvidia&#8217;s founder and CEO, Jensen Huang.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">&quot;Mom, we're getting the gang back together&quot;</p>
<p>All 8 authors of 'Attention is All You Need', the paper that gave birth to transformer tech and the current tidal wave of AI, join <a href="https://twitter.com/nvidia?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">@nvidia</a> Founder on March 20th.</p>
<p>And yes, that includes <a href="https://twitter.com/ilblackdragon?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">@ilblackdragon</a>, co-founder of NEAR.</p>
<p>Details: <a href="https://t.co/DCmHOzxPE2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://t.co/DCmHOzxPE2</a></p>
<p>&mdash; NEAR Protocol (@NEARProtocol) <a href="https://twitter.com/NEARProtocol/status/1765890146950385814?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">March 7, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Polosukhin&#8217;s participation is highly anticipated, as it could signal NEAR&#8217;s deeper foray into AI applications and potential collaborations with Nvidia. This has sparked significant interest in the NEAR token as investors and enthusiasts speculate on the future integrations and innovations that may arise from this intersection of blockchain and AI.</p>
<p>The upcoming release of Near Tasks, an AI facet of NEAR&#8217;s ecosystem, further fueled speculation about the protocol&#8217;s commitment to leveraging AI within its infrastructure. This move could potentially position NEAR as a key player in the emerging field of decentralized AI, offering scalable and efficient solutions for AI applications.</p>

<p><strong>Render Network Spotlight:</strong> Jules Urbach, founder of Render Network, is <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/render-founder-nvidias-gtc-in-4-days-rndr-surge-ahead/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">set to deliver</a> a highly anticipated talk at the Nvidia GTC conference. His presentation, titled &#8220;The Future of Rendering: Real-Time Ray Tracing, AI, Holographic Displays, and the Blockchain,&#8221; promises to offer insights into the future of digital content creation and the role of decentralized networks in supporting these advancements.</p>
<p>Urbach&#8217;s history of impactful presentations at GTC, including his collaboration with Nvidia&#8217;s Jensen Huang in 2013, suggests that this year&#8217;s talk could have significant implications for the Render Network and the broader ecosystem of GPU computing and AI.</p>
<p>“I think it will be one of my most relevant GTC talks, and a reflection of the next paradigm shift we are entering for distributed GPU systems, on par with the first one back in 2013 — when I took the stage with Jensen to announce Render’s centralized precursor (ORC) and then launched with AWS,” Urbach stated looking ahead</p>
<h2>#3 Etherfi Launch</h2>
<p>Etherfi, a leading liquid restaking protocol, is set to launch its ETHFI token today, March 18, marking a significant development in the DeFi space. The launch on Binance&#8217;s Launchpool will enable users to stake BNB or FDUSD tokens to farm ETHFI tokens, offering early access to rewards and project engagement.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The Eligibility Checker has been updated and is now LIVE!<a href="https://t.co/dWjoxJIXTK" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://t.co/dWjoxJIXTK</a> <a href="https://t.co/UafFBE6AIk" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/UafFBE6AIk</a></p>
<p>&mdash; ether.fi (@ether_fi) <a href="https://twitter.com/ether_fi/status/1769533006845276533?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">March 18, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Following a successful $23 million Series A funding round, EtherFi&#8217;s total value locked (TVL) has surged to $2.9 billion, according to DefiLlama <a href="https://defillama.com/protocol/ether.fi" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">data</a>. The protocol&#8217;s innovative approach to liquid restaking, allowing users to access Ethereum staking rewards and additional yields without locking up assets, underscores its potential to reshape the Ethereum and broader crypto ecosystem.</p>
<p>Users can stake their Ethereum directly through Etherfi and receive ETHFI tokens in return. These crypto tokens represent the staked Ethereum and accrue staking rewards over time. However, unlike traditional staking, ETHFI tokens can be used within the DeFi ecosystem, offering users the flexibility to participate in other yield-generating activities without sacrificing their staking rewards.</p>
<p>Etherfi leverages EigenLayer, a layer that builds on top of Ethereum, to enable additional yields on top of Ethereum staking rewards. This integration not only enhances the reward structure for stakers but also contributes to the security and scalability of the Ethereum network by leveraging EigenLayer&#8217;s functionalities.</p>
<p>At press time, BTC traded at $68,096.</p>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />文章讨论了SEC批准的加密货币交易所产品，以及Vanguard对比特币交易所产品的立场。Jim Bianco为Vanguard辩护，指出其在ETF市场中的成功表现。文章还提到Vanguard的CEO Tim Buckley表示公司不会投资比特币ETF，并解释该决定是基于公司的3000万基金持有者的意见，他们不感兴趣。文章最后澄清了Buckley是否离开Vanguard以及相关细节。Jim Bianco的论点从整体上凸显了Vanguard在ETF市场中的出色表现。 <div>
<p>The cryptocurrency market has witnessed a major turning point following the approval of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-markets-swell-in-2024-spotlight-bitcoin-etfs/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)</a> by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on January 11. However, despite its intriguing growth over time, several popular figures in the crypto landscape are still against the exchange products.</p>
<h2>Jim Biance Defends Vanguard&#8217;s Position Toward Bitcoin Spot ETFs</h2>
<p>President and founder of Bianco Research, Jim Bianco, has taken to the X platform to <a href="https://x.com/biancoresearch/status/1769386975851593875?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reveal</a> his insights regarding Vanguard&#8217;s stance against Bitcoin exchange-traded products while highlighting the company&#8217;s huge success without adopting the ETFs.</p>

<p>Bianco has highlighted several significant perspectives the community should consider regarding the subject. He believes that &#8220;Vanguard is the 850-pound gorilla&#8221; in the ETF market, while asset management firm &#8220;BlackRock is the 800-pound gorilla.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Jim, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-gobbles-up-nearly-196000-btc/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Blackrock</a>&#8216;s ETF assets were valued at $2.84 trillion as of March 15. Meanwhile, about $18.19 billion was invested in all of their ETFs in the past week, with $2.6 billion going into IBIT.</p>
<p>He further drew a comparison to Vanguard&#8217;s assets, which were valued at $2.58 trillion, amassing approximately $29.44 billion inflow into all their ETFs last week, with zero invested in Bitcoin ETFs. This information demonstrates Vanguard&#8217;s strong results in the larger ETF industry, which has made it one of the best-performing firms in the market over time.</p>
<p>Bianco&#8217;s insights came in light of the criticism from the crypto community after Vanguard&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Tim Buckley disclosed the company&#8217;s decision to not invest BTC ETFs.</p>
<p>In a video released by Vanguard, Tim Buckley stated that the firm &#8220;does not have plans to offer Bitcoin spot ETFs.&#8221; This is because it is not considered a &#8220;store of value&#8221; and does not belong in a &#8220;long-term portfolio.&#8221;</p>
<p>In spite of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cathie-wood-vanguards-stance-terrible/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">critiques</a> from the community, the CEO restated the firm&#8217;s viewpoint, which remained unaltered. He further declared that unless there was a &#8220;major shift in Bitcoin&#8217;s asset class,&#8221; Vanguard would continue to uphold its decision not to provide the products.</p>
<h2>A 30 Million Fundholders Decision</h2>
<p>Bianco also pointed out that the company&#8217;s decision was a result of 30 million fundholders &#8220;who are not interested in Bitcoin,&#8221; and Tim Buckley was just an &#8220;effective spokesman&#8221; for these fundholders.</p>
<p>He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Vanguard is not publicly owned. It is mutual, which means the fundholders own the company and Buckly is effectively the spokesman for these 30 million fundholders, who tell him they are not interested in BTC.</p></blockquote>
<p>These fundholders believe that Vanguard&#8217;s main focus should be on improving its customer service, not BTC because the firm has grown so &#8220;quickly and so successful.&#8221;</p>

<p>So far, Bianco has refuted claims within the crypto community about Buckley leaving Vanguard, stating that the CEO is retiring rather than being let go. &#8220;He is staying for another nine and half months as he is retiring at the end of the year,&#8221; he added.</p>

<title>Solana DeFi TVL Rockets 80%: Anticipating The Impact On SOL Price</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/solana-defi-tvl-rockets-80-impact-on-sol-price/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/solana-defi-tvl-rockets-80-impact-on-sol-price/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。Solana的DeFi活动激增，TVL达到38亿美元，交易量增长125%，超越以太坊。SOL币价上涨70%，市场乐观情绪高涨。分析指出OBV和CMF指标支持SOL继续上涨。Solana迅速发展的DeFi生态系统和网络活动使其在加密货币市场中成为令人瞩目的参与者。 <div>
<p>Solana, the blockchain network known for its speed and scalability, has witnessed an unprecedented surge in decentralized finance (DeFi) activity, propelling its native token, SOL, to new heights.</p>
<p>Not only has Solana&#8217;s DeFi total value locked (TVL) soared by over 80% in the past month, but its network activity has also surpassed that of Ethereum, further solidifying its position as a leading player in the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<h2><strong>Solana Shines With Soaring DeFi TVL </strong></h2>
<p>On the back of impressive growth,<a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Solana" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> Solana&#8217;s DeFi TVL</a> has reached its highest level in the last two years, currently standing at an impressive $3.8 billion, according to data from DefiLlama.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-287845" height="309" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_0cd344.png?resize=1024%2C309" width="1024" /></p>

<p>This surge in TVL can be attributed to a substantial uptick in trading volume on the DeFi protocols built on the altcoin&#8217;s Layer 1 network (L1). Since the beginning of the month, the daily trading volume on these protocols has experienced an astonishing 125% increase.</p>

<h2><strong>Altcoin&#8217;s Network Activity Up As Well</strong></h2>
<p>However, it is not just the DeFi metrics that showcase Solana&#8217;s remarkable performance. The network&#8217;s activity has recently surpassed that of Ethereum, the world&#8217;s leading blockchain platform.</p>
<p>Solana&#8217;s solid infrastructure and low transaction fees have attracted traders and investors seeking opportunities amidst a turbulent market. As a result, Solana&#8217;s total trading volume on March 16 exceeded Ethereum&#8217;s daily volume by more than $1.1 billion, reaching an impressive $3.52 billion, as reported by DefiLlama.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-287840" height="386" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_cd27e4.png?resize=956%2C386" width="956" /></p>

<p>The combination of Solana&#8217;s explosive DeFi growth and network activity has had a profound impact on the value of the<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/solana" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> SOL token.</a> Trading at $207 at the time of writing, SOL has experienced a remarkable 70% increase in value over the past month, defying the market&#8217;s downward trend.</p>
<p>While other cryptocurrencies grapple with price reversals, SOL continues to surge, buoyed by bullish sentiment and growing demand.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/7lHtcpS3/" width="2475" /></p>

<p>Analysts have pointed to key indicators, such as the On-Balance-Volume (OBV) and Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), which further validate SOL&#8217;s upward trajectory. The OBV, which tracks buying and selling pressure, has witnessed a steady uptrend, signaling a growth in buying momentum.</p>

<p>The CMF, measuring the flow of money in and out of an asset, confirms the increase in liquidity inflow into the SOL market. These indicators suggest a sustained positive sentiment surrounding SOL.</p>
<p>The remarkable growth of Solana&#8217;s DeFi ecosystem, coupled with its<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-network-forces-binance-to-halt-withdrawals/"> surge in network activity</a>, has positioned the blockchain as a formidable player in the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p>As the industry continues to evolve, Solana&#8217;s ability to attract DeFi participants, generate substantial revenue through network fees, and defy market trends bodes well for its future prospects.</p>

<title>Shiba Inu: Data Reveals Big Surge Edging Bitcoin, Ethereum Despite Setbacks</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-data-reveals-big-surge-edging-bitcoin/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-data-reveals-big-surge-edging-bitcoin/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章介绍了2024年热门的meme币市场，以及Shiba Inu（SHIB）在2024年悄悄夺得了风头。SHIB的价格大幅上涨，主要得益于在2022年推出的Ethereum Layer 2网络Shibarium的广泛采用。与此同时，比特币和以太坊虽然也有不错的增长，但在面对Shiba Inu的表现时显得较为谨慎。市场分析师预计SHIB还有进一步上涨的潜力，可能会达到更高的价位。文章中展示了这些市场趋势以及可能的未来发展。 <div>
<p>Move over, Bitcoin and Ethereum. The meme coin market is barking mad with Shiba Inu (SHIB) quietly stealing the show in 2024. While the big dogs have been grabbing headlines with new all-time highs, the self-proclaimed &#8220;Doge Killer&#8221; has been on a tear, outperforming its established rivals with a nearly 210% year-to-date (YTD) surge.</p>
<p>While Bitcoin and Ethereum have garnered significant attention for their price performance, Shiba Inu has quietly outpaced both, achieving impressive growth and capturing the interest of investors and analysts alike.</p>
<h2><strong>Shiba Inu&#8217;s Meteoric Rise: A Tale of Adoption And Innovation</strong></h2>
<p>Shiba Inu&#8217;s SHIB token has witnessed a staggering 246% price increase since the beginning of the year, reaching a peak of $0.00003599 before settling at a slightly lower but still remarkable price of $0.00002779. This unexpected surge has propelled Shiba Inu into the spotlight, raising questions about the factors behind its success.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-287810" height="384" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_ae9088.png?resize=635%2C384" width="635" /></p>

<p>At the time of writing, SHIB was trading at $0.000028,<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/shiba-inu" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> up 10% in the last 24 hours,</a> but shed 17% in the last seven days, data from Coingecko shows.</p>

<p>The key driver behind Shiba Inu&#8217;s remarkable performance lies in the burgeoning adoption and utilization of <a href="https://www.shibariumscan.io/stats" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Shibarium,</a> an Ethereum Layer 2 network introduced by the Shiba Inu ecosystem in August 2022. Shibarium has overcome initial challenges and gained significant traction, with major crypto platforms like Gate.io integrating the network.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-287802" height="210" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_353e12.png?resize=1024%2C210" width="1024" /></p>

<p>This integration has facilitated the processing of over 410 million transactions on Shibarium, demonstrating its robustness and efficiency compared to other Layer 2 solutions. The widespread adoption of Shibarium has fueled optimism among investors, contributing to the token&#8217;s price surge.</p>
<h2><strong>Bitcoin And Ethereum: Steady Growth Amidst The Shiba Inu Storm</strong></h2>
<p>While Shiba Inu has stolen the limelight, Bitcoin and Ethereum have also experienced substantial growth this year, albeit at a more measured pace. Bitcoin has breached its previous all-time high, reaching new price discovery territory as it surpassed multiple resistance points above $70,000. Despite setting new records, Bitcoin&#8217;s year-to-date (YTD) gain stands at a steady 65%, starting the year at $42 and currently trading at $68,049.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/z62Jr1HJ/" width="2475" /></p>
<p>Ethereum, on the other hand, has demonstrated impressive price performance, soaring above several resistance levels to trade at $3,840 at the time of writing. Beginning the year at $2,280, Ethereum has slightly outperformed Bitcoin with a YTD increase of 68.5%. While these gains are significant, they pale in comparison to Shiba Inu&#8217;s remarkable 246% surge.</p>

<strong>Potential For Further Growth: A Promising Horizon</strong>
<p>Despite its impressive rally, the memecoin is still 170% away from reclaiming its 2021 all-time high, while Bitcoin has already surpassed its previous peak. This discrepancy has led market analysts to anticipate even more substantial price surges for SHIB, as it suggests significant room for growth. As a result, price projections predicting rallies towards the $0.01 territory have emerged, further fueling investor excitement.</p>

<title>Cardano Founder Dispels FUD: Insights On Hydra, Scaling And Partnerships</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-founder-fud-hydra-scaling-partnerships/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-founder-fud-hydra-scaling-partnerships/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。查尔斯·霍金森在周末的一系列消息中解决了关于Cardano项目的各种关切和谣言，特别是关于Hydra的发展、伙伴关系和区块链的整体扩展策略。霍金森驳斥了有关Hydra项目被取消的传言，并提供了关于DIS合作伙伴关系、ERC20转换器等各种倡议的时间表。他还澄清了有关World Mobile合作伙伴关系以及伙伴链的误解。霍金森的讨论重新确认了Cardano团队对以安全和可持续的方式扩展网络的承诺，同时推动区块链技术潜力的边界。ADA目前在0.696美元交易。 <div>
<p>In a series of messages over the weekend, Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, addressed various concerns and rumors circulating about the project, specifically regarding the development of Hydra, partnerships, and the overall scaling strategy for the blockchain.</p>
<h2>Cardano Founder Debunks FUD</h2>
<p>Hoskinson <a href="https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">began</a> by addressing rumors that the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-founder-debunks-hydra-scaling-issues/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Hydra protocol</a> had been abandoned, labeling such claims as baseless fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). &#8220;I&#8217;m seeing some videos claiming that Hydra has been abandoned. It is just pure FUD. The team has never been more productive and motivated, there is great community engagement and new papers on the way for enhancements to the protocol,&#8221; Hoskinson stated. He directed those curious about the project to the official Hydra website for the latest information.</p>
<p>When confronted with a barrage of questions regarding the timeline for various initiatives such as the DISH partnership, the ERC20 converter, activities in Ethiopia, other <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-strengthen-its-ecosystem-africa-partnership/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">African ventures</a>, and a partnership in Mongolia, Hoskinson provided a comprehensive update.</p>

<p>He highlighted the successful deployment of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/game-on-cardano-erc-20-convertor-coming-soon-to-testnet/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">ERC20 converter</a>, which facilitated <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-backed-singularitynet-sets-in-switzerland/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">SingularityNET</a>&#8216;s transition to Cardano, making it a billion-dollar asset. Hoskinson further noted, “Our Africa work continues through John via the RealFi company, we successfully trained developers in Mongolia and concluded pilots with all the entities mentioned. Sorry, try again.”</p>
<p>Further addressing queries about scaling Cardano, Hoskinson encouraged viewers to watch a detailed video that outlines Cardano&#8217;s preparedness for scaling challenges in a decentralized, secure, and high-integrity manner. He underscored Cardano&#8217;s achievements, including over 2300 days of continuous operation, as evidence of the project&#8217;s resilience and commitment to its founding principles.</p>
<p>“Cardano is best positioned to meet these challenges in a decentralized, secure, and high integrity way. Never forget what we&#8217;ve accomplished together with over 2300+ days uptime 24/7 while maintaining our principles,” Hoskinson said.</p>
<h2>Clarifications On The World Mobile Partnership</h2>
<p>Regarding the skepticism and negativity directed towards Cardano, Hoskinson <a href="https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1769452455257845806" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">speculated</a>, &#8220;Man, it&#8217;s raining FUD this weekend, and I&#8217;m not sure about the origin. I guess it&#8217;s that time of the cycle where everyone freaks out about Cardano&#8217;s potential and roadmap, so they throw a wave of FUD at us.&#8221;</p>

<p>He provided insights into the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-africa-special-iog-partners-with-world-mobile-to-connect-250k-people/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">partnership with World Mobile</a>, emphasizing the project&#8217;s ambitious goals. &#8220;No current system in the entire blockchain ecosystem is capable or has technology to resolve a project at this scale involving billions of users. That&#8217;s why World Mobile is building it,&#8221; Hoskinson explained.</p>
<p>Clarifying misconceptions about partnerchains, Hoskinson emphasized that they are indeed part of Cardano, contrary to some community misunderstandings. Partnerchains are designed to allow for the development of hypercomplex projects with unique protocols, such as different consensus mechanisms, ledger rules, and transaction semantics. He pointed out that this flexibility is crucial for projects like World Mobile and decentralized social networks, aiming to connect the unconnected through a decentralized network with equal and fair rules.</p>
<p>Hoskinson&#8217;s discourse over the weekend provided not only rebuttals to the circulating FUD but also reaffirmed the strategic direction and robust foundation upon which Cardano is building its future. His statements reinforce the commitment of the Cardano team to scale the network securely and sustainably while pushing the boundaries of blockchain technology&#8217;s potential.</p>
<p>At press time, ADA traded at $0.696.</p>

<p>Cryptocurrency markets witnessed seismic activity as Whale Alert, a leading service tracking large crypto transactions, reported a monumental transfer of Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens. A staggering 1 trillion SHIB, equivalent to $28,814,000, was observed in transit from an undisclosed wallet to the portals of Gate.io, a major cryptocurrency exchange.</p>

<p>The colossal transfer sent shockwaves through the crypto community, prompting intense speculation about its implications. While the sender&#8217;s identity remains a mystery, such massive movements to exchanges often signal imminent sales or significant trading activity.

<h2><strong>Navigating Uncertainty Amid Liquidation Surge</strong></h2>
<p>As the SHIB market grappled with uncertainty, investors faced a tumultuous landscape of fluctuating prices and heightened liquidations. In the past 24 hours, SHIB experienced a <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/shiba-inu" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">significant downturn</a>, with prices plummeting by 14.27%.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/UuMIqmgN/" width="1835" /></p>

<p>Adding to market jitters, data from CoinGlass revealed a surge in liquidations totaling a staggering $5,280,000. Of this amount, $4,080,000 stemmed from long liquidations, while $1,200,000 resulted from short liquidations.</p>

<strong>Shiba Inu Shows Resilience</strong>
<p>Despite the recent dip, SHIB has demonstrated <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-active-addresses-soar-over-170/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">remarkable resilience</a> over the past month, boasting a staggering 194% increase following a substantial rally. However, the influx of SHIB tokens to Gate.io has cast a shadow of doubt over the market&#8217;s stability, leaving the SHIB community on edge.</p>

<title>Nigeria SEC To Hike VASP Registration Fees Under New Regime – Details</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/nigeria-sec-to-hike-vasp-registration-fees-under/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/nigeria-sec-to-hike-vasp-registration-fees-under/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。尼日利亚证券交易委员会提议提高虚拟资产服务提供商（VASP）寻求运营许可的注册费用。此外，其他规定的变化也包括加密行业的主要方面。VASP的注册费用将增加400％，最低实收资本要求也将提高。文章还谈到了尼日利亚与币安交易所的争议，以及加密市场的最新数据。 <div>
<p>Nigeria&#8217;s Securities and Exchange Commission has proposed to raise the registration fees for virtual asset service providers (VASP) seeking an operational license. This development is accompanied by other changes in the regulations governing the key aspects of the crypto industry in the West African country.</p>

<h2>VASP Registration Fees In Nigeria To Rise By 400%</h2>
<p>On March 15, the Nigerian SEC released a<a href="https://sec.gov.ng/proposed-major-amendment-to-the-rules-on-issuance-offering-platforms-and-custody-of-digital-assets-to-stakeholders-and-the-general-public/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> set of proposed amendments</a> to its Rules on Digital Assets Issuance, Offering Platforms, Exchange, and Custody. According to the securities regulator, the suggested changes are aimed at providing more regulatory clarity to a rapidly developing crypto market as well as implementing feedback from industry players following recent discussions with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). </p>
<p>Of all the updated regulations, a quintupling increase in VASP registration fees from 30 million ($18,841.75) to 150 million ($94,208.76) has been a major talking point as such policies are usually viewed as a means of discouraging business participation, in this case, the emergence of new crypto exchanges. Meanwhile, it could also function as a protective mechanism, thus ensuring that only sturdy and well-funded parties are able to operate as VASPs.</p>
<p>Furthermore, crypto exchanges and trading platforms would now be expected to pay an application fee and processing fee of 300,000 naira ($188.42) and 1,000,000 naira ($628.06) as opposed to previous values of 100,000 ($62.81) and 300,000 ($188.42) respectively. </p>
<p>In addition, the country&#8217;s regulator has also raised the minimum paid-up capital for these businesses to 1,000,000,000 naira ($628,058.40) which must be set in bank balances, fixed assets, or as an investment in certain securities. Meanwhile, there will be a fidelity bond covering up to 25% of this minimum paid-up capital in line with the Commission’s existing rules and regulations. </p>

<h2>The Nigerian Crypto Space And Its Troubles</h2>
<p>Lately, Nigeria has been among major crypto headlines due to an ongoing squabble with prominent crypto exchange Binance. The government of the West African nation has accused Binance of playing a significant role in the devaluation of Nigerian Naira, demanding compensation to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/nigeria-fines-binance-10-billion/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">the tune of $10 billion. </a></p>
<p>This accusation has been accompanied by the Nigerian government making other demands of Binance in terms of user data and reportedly<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/nigeria-detains-binances-crypto-crime-investigator/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> detaining two of the exchange’s top executives</a>. In response, Binance <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-suspends-all-operations-in-nigeria/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">has shut down all Nigerian Naira (NGN) services</a> as well as delisted Naira trading pairs on its platform. However, there are still no indications the exchange will pull out of the African nation. </p>
<p>At the time of writing, the total crypto market cap is valued at $2.52 trillion, following a 4.23% decline in the last day. Meanwhile, Bitcoin, the market leader, now trades at $66,275.63 due to an ongoing price correction.</p>

<div> <br /><br />摘要: 这些信息是积极的<br />
SHIB的Layer-2区块链Shibarium达到了惊人的交易吞吐量里程碑，表现出了平台的稳定性和潜力。其与K9 Finance的战略合作有助于拓展生态系统，推动创新。尽管SHIB价格受到市场波动的影响，但SHIB的发展努力受到认可，被列入福布斯投资加密货币前十名，并受到金融节目《关注你的金钱》的关注。 <div>
<p>Shibarium, the Layer-2 blockchain developed by the creative minds behind Shiba Inu (SHIB), has shattered expectations by reaching an extraordinary milestone in transaction throughput. Surpassing an impressive<a href="https://www.shibariumscan.io/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> 411 million transactions,</a>   Shibariumscan has revealed the platform&#8217;s resilience in the face of market volatility.</p>

<p>The recent surge in user adoption and the influx of dApp builders have contributed to Shibarium&#8217;s exponential growth. Over the past few days alone, more than 3 million transfers have been added, solidifying Shibarium&#8217;s position as a force to be reckoned with in the blockchain space.</p>
<p>This achievement is particularly impressive given the current daily transaction throughput of 1.03 million, which, although lower than its peak of 4.2 million transfers per day on February 20, reflects the platform&#8217;s stability and potential for further expansion.</p>

<h2><strong>Shibarium Forges Strategic Partnership, Expanding Its Ecosystem</strong></h2>
<p>In a move to fortify its ecosystem and foster innovation, Shibarium has recently formed a strategic partnership with K9 Finance, a prominent player in the financial technology industry.</p>
<p>This collaboration marks a significant milestone for both parties, as K9 Finance launches its native coin, KNINE, on the Shibarium platform. As a testament to their commitment, Shytoshi Kusama, the visionary leader behind SHIB, and Kaal Dhairya, the brilliant SHIB lead developer, have been appointed as official advisors to K9 Finance.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-partner-token-featured-on-us-tv-station/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">partnership between Shibarium and K9 Finance</a> showcases the platform&#8217;s dedication to fostering collaborations that drive growth and fuel its mission to revolutionize the blockchain landscape. This strategic alliance will undoubtedly open doors to new possibilities, leading to enhanced user experiences and the creation of innovative decentralized applications.</p>
<h2><strong>SHIB Navigates Challenging Waters Amidst Market Turbulence</strong></h2>
<p>While Shibarium celebrates its record-breaking achievements, the price of<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-active-addresses-soar-over-170/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> Shiba Inu</a> (SHIB), the second-largest meme cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has experienced a turbulent ride in recent days.</p>
<p>Exhibiting a correlation with the price movements of Bitcoin (BTC), SHIB has encountered a 28% decrease in value following Bitcoin&#8217;s correction from its all-time high of $73,750.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/KHvF4SWB/" width="1835" /></p>

<p>Investors may find these price fluctuations discouraging, but it is crucial to consider the broader context of SHIB&#8217;s ongoing development efforts. Notably, SHIB received recognition and was featured on Forbes&#8217; prestigious top 10 list of cryptocurrencies to invest in.</p>

<p>Additionally, the cryptocurrency garnered attention on the popular financial program &#8220;Eye on Your Money,&#8221; where it was mentioned alongside Bitcoin. While these accolades did not result in immediate price surges, they reinforce SHIB&#8217;s potential and the significance of its long-term growth prospects.</p>

<title>Crypto Analyst Sets $5 Target For Cardano Price – Here’s How</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-analyst-sets-5-target-for-cardano-price-how/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-analyst-sets-5-target-for-cardano-price-how/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />ADA过去一周经历了波动，价格一度上涨至多月高点，但随后暴跌18%。一位知名分析师预测，ADA价格将在未来几个月中涨幅高达670%。当前ADA价格为0.6626美元，市值超过230亿美元。分析师认为ADA价格将在0.55美元和0.80美元之间水平震荡，然后迅速上涨至1.70美元，为未来的5美元突破铺平道路。ADA仍然是前十大加密货币之一。 <div>
<p class="p1">The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-king-of-dead-coins/">price action of Cardano</a> (ADA) over the past week is a story of two halves, with the token notching a new multi-month high early in the week only to crash by over 18% a few days afterward. This recent decline in ADA price reflects a broader bearish climate in the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p class="p1">Interestingly, a renowned crypto analyst on the X platform has put forward an exciting projection for the price of Cardano over the coming months. This latest price analysis suggests that this latest price downturn will be short-lived, with a bullish future on the horizon.</p>
<h2 class="p1">Analyst Predicts Cardano Price To Surge By 670%</h2>
<p class="p1">Popular crypto analyst <a href="https://x.com/ali_charts/status/1769096425407721629?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Ali Martinez took to X</a> to share his latest prognosis on the price of the Cardano token. According to the expert, the cryptocurrency’s current price action seems to be mirroring a pattern from 2018 to 2021.</p>
<p><img alt="Cardano" class="aligncenter wp-image-287623 size-large" height="660" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GI0X0dcXgAAw0Pf.jpeg?resize=955%2C660" width="955" /></p>

<p class="p1">From the highlighted weekly chart, the ADA price only recently broke out of a consolidation zone, which looks like a replica of the 2018 &#8211; 2020 consolidation range. Having retested the upper boundary of the range, the token looks set for a price upswing.</p>

<p class="p1">However, Martinez expects the Cardano price to move horizontally between $0.55 and $0.80 over the coming weeks. This period of sluggish activity will then be followed by a rapid price upswing to $1.70, according to the analyst.</p>
<p class="p1">In his post, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-doge-trading-volume/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Martinez</a> mentioned the possibility of a period of further price consolidation after the over 160% surge to $1.70. This is expected to “set the stage for a breakout to $5” for the Cardano price</p>
<p class="p1">This audacious projection represents an almost 700% surge for the ADA token from the current price point. From the highlighted chart, these bullish moves are expected to occur over the next few months in 2024.</p>
<h2 class="p1">ADA Price Overview</h2>
<p class="p1">As of this writing, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-network-sees-massive-growth-in-new-wallets/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Cardano token</a> is valued at $0.6626, reflecting a steep 8.3% decline in the past 24 hours. The altcoin, like the general market, has been experiencing a significant amount of bearish pressure over the past few days.</p>

<p class="p1">This dip comes barely three days after <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/analyst-predicts-cardano-price-to-skyrocket-by-1400/">ADA’s price</a> hit $0.8, its highest level in nearly two years. According to data from CoinGecko, the value of cryptocurrency has dropped by more than 18% since then, with a 12% decline in its weekly timeframe.</p>
<p class="p1">Nevertheless, the Cardano token still ranks as one of the ten largest cryptocurrencies in the sector, with a market capitalization of over $23 billion.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要: 这些信息是积极的。<br />约翰·迪顿是一位著名律师和XRP支持者，决定挑战麻省现任参议员伊丽莎白·沃伦，他投入了50万美元的资金进入参议员竞选。他得到了加密社区的支持，包括卡尔达诺创始人查尔斯·霍金森。迪顿对胜选充满信心，认为沃伦容易受到挑战。他利用社交媒体筹集资金，主张自由和加密立场。迪顿的挑战已经引起了媒体的关注，他的竞选策略强调反对传统政治。<br /> <div>
<p>In a bold move, prominent lawyer and XRP proponent John Deaton has made a substantial $500,000 donation to his Senate campaign against incumbent US senator for Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren.</p>
<p>Deaton is presenting a Republican challenge to senator Warren, giving the prominent progressive her first serious, albeit still remote, opponent and setting up an election-season dispute over cryptocurrencies.</p>

<h2><strong>Deaton&#8217;s Campaign Gains Momentum With Crypto Community Support</strong></h2>
<p>Deaton&#8217;s announcement has ignited a surge of support from the crypto community, with many prominent figures expressing their endorsement and willingness to contribute to his campaign.</p>
<p>Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson was among the first to step forward, donating the maximum allowable amount of $3,300. <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/elizabeth-warren-rallies-donors-marine-veteran-crypto-attorney-john-deaton-announces-senate-challenge" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Deaton&#8217;s campaign</a> has also embraced crypto donations, allowing supporters to contribute using various cryptocurrencies.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I put in $500K of my own money because I know I can win. Please help me get to $1 million by March 31. Donate traditionally or through Crypto because freedom is on the line. <a href="https://t.co/qgDX3PTWJQ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://t.co/qgDX3PTWJQ</a></p>
<p>— John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1768759999533334680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">March 15, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<h2><strong>Deaton Confident In Victory, Cites Warren&#8217;s Vulnerabilities</strong></h2>
<p>Despite Warren&#8217;s long-standing presence in Massachusetts politics, Deaton exudes confidence in his ability to secure victory in the upcoming election.</p>
<p>He highlights several factors that indicate Warren&#8217;s vulnerability, including her low favorability ratings and the fact that a significant portion of eligible voters in Massachusetts are neither Democrats nor Republicans.</p>
<p>Deaton believes these factors, coupled with his strong support from the crypto community, give him a fighting chance to unseat the incumbent senator.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/uB97CnpQ/" width="1835" /></p>

<strong>XRP Community Speculates On Deaton&#8217;s Potential Impact On Crypto Regulation</strong>
<p>While Deaton&#8217;s campaign primarily focuses on challenging Warren&#8217;s anti-crypto stance, the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">XRP</a> community is abuzz with speculation about the potential implications of his victory for the ongoing Ripple lawsuit.</p>
<p>Deaton&#8217;s extensive legal experience and vocal support for the crypto industry have led many to believe that his election could positively influence the outcome of the case.</p>
<p>However, it remains uncertain whether Deaton&#8217;s involvement in the Senate race will directly impact the Ripple lawsuit.</p>

<strong>Deaton&#8217;s Fundraising Efforts And Campaign Strategy</strong>
<p>To bolster his campaign&#8217;s financial resources, Deaton has set an ambitious goal of raising $1 million by March 31st. He has turned to his substantial social media following, primarily crypto enthusiasts, to contribute to the cause.</p>
<p>Deaton&#8217;s campaign strategy emphasizes the importance of freedom and the need for nonpartisan leadership in Washington that represents the interests of ordinary citizens.</p>
<p>He believes that his outsider status and willingness to challenge the status quo resonate with voters disillusioned with traditional politics.</p>
<strong>Media Attention And Recognition Of Deaton&#8217;s Challenge</strong>
<p>Deaton&#8217;s candidacy has garnered significant media attention, with outlets such as Fox Business recognizing him as a major challenger who poses a genuine threat to Warren&#8217;s re-election bid.</p>
<p>His campaign has successfully captured the public&#8217;s imagination, and his message of freedom and crypto advocacy has struck a chord with many voters.</p>
<p>As the race heats up, it remains to be seen whether Deaton&#8217;s grassroots campaign can overcome the challenges posed by Warren&#8217;s incumbency and political establishment support.</p>
