<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。香港证监会计划在第二季度推出基于比特币的ETF，可能成为全球比特币ETF市场的领导者。此举可能引发资金流向变化，尤其在亚洲市场。与美国只允许现金交易不同，香港允许实物交易，这可能带来更高的资产管理规模和交易量。虽然存在一些挑战，如中国市场无法获得这些ETF，但香港ETF的成功可能会超出预期。BTC目前交易价格为70158美元。 <div>
<p>Hong Kong is on the verge of a groundbreaking move in the Bitcoin space. According to a recent Bloomberg Intelligence <a href="https://t.co/IxcdWEFDvC" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, the Hong Kong Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) is <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/spot-bitcoin-etf-chinese-fund-giant-hong-kong/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">expected to approve</a> spot Bitcoin ETFs with in-kind creations and redemptions in the upcoming second quarter. This development could significantly alter the landscape of crypto investments, potentially positioning Hong Kong as a leader in the global Bitcoin ETF market.</p>
<p>Noelle Acheson, a prominent voice in the crypto industry and author of the “Crypto is Macro Now” newsletter, weighed in on the potential implications of this move. &#8220;The Asian crypto market is much larger than the US crypto market in terms of volume,” Acheson stated.</p>
<p>She elaborated on two possibilities: the existing high volume might indicate that the market is already saturated, or it could suggest a deeper familiarity and comfort with crypto assets in Asia. &#8220;Listed ETFs in Hong Kong could channel a significant amount of money into &#8216;approved&#8217; portfolio allocation,” Acheson added, hinting at the potential for a major shift in investment flows.</p>

<p>Adding to the discussion, Eric Balchunas, a Bloomberg ETF expert, <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1772602019133423921" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">underscored</a> the significance of Hong Kong&#8217;s approach to allowing<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-turn-spot-bitcoin-etf-cash-redemption/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> in-kind creations</a> and redemptions for spot Bitcoin ETFs—a stark contrast to the US, which only allows cash creations. &#8220;This could help spark AUM and volume in the fast-growing region,&#8221; Balchunas commented, pointing out the strategic advantage Hong Kong might gain.</p>
<p>Caitlin Long, the founder and CEO of Custodia Bank, <a href="https://twitter.com/i/bookmarks?post_id=1772802183014097103" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">highlighted</a> another key aspect of Hong Kong&#8217;s proposed ETF structure: the ability to withdraw Bitcoin directly, which ensures that investors are not just holding &#8220;paper bitcoins.&#8221; Long expressed her excitement about this development, stating, &#8220;If this is true (need confirmation), it’d be HUGE indeed — and it’d be ironic, given that Hong Kong, not the US, would be doing it. Meanwhile, US banks would watch from the sidelines as they’re left in the dust…”</p>
<h2>Will Hong Kong’s Bitcoin ETFs Be Bigger Than Its US Peers?</h2>
<p>The conversation around the potential of Hong Kong&#8217;s Bitcoin ETFs extended beyond industry experts to the wider crypto community. Bitcoin Munger, a renowned analyst on X, <a href="https://twitter.com/bitcoinmunger/status/1772604152520036428" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">argued</a> that the Hong Kong ETFs could serve as a far more bullish catalyst than those in the US.</p>

<p>Citing data from Glassnode showing a year-over-year supply change of Bitcoin moving from West to East, he suggested that this trend strengthens the case for Hong Kong&#8217;s ETFs outshining their US counterparts. “Coins have been moving from West to East. Makes a strong case that the Hong Kong ETFs are going to be a far more bullish catalyst than the US ETFs,” he remarked.</p>
<img alt="Bitcoin regional year-over-year supply change" class="size-full wp-image-289926" height="576" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GJRhA3QW4AAoBqw.jpg?resize=1024%2C576" width="1024" />
<p>However, not everyone is convinced of the disproportionate impact of Hong Kong&#8217;s ETFs. In a spirited exchange, Eric Balchunas cautioned against overestimating Hong Kong&#8217;s market size relative to the US. “Let’s not get crazy now. HK tiny vs US,” Balchunas replied.</p>
<p>Bitcoin Munger retorted by suggesting that the success of Hong Kong&#8217;s ETFs might not be fully appreciated yet, and any positive surprises could leave analysts, including Balchunas, taken aback.</p>
<p>When a user raised a pertinent question about the accessibility of these ETFs to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/chinas-crypto-investors-earn-1b-in-profits/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Mainland Chinese investors</a>, Balchunas responded negatively, “No not available.” This dampens some enthusiasm, as the significant Chinese market, amidst a real estate crisis and an inclination towards gold, might have been a strong supporter of Bitcoin through these ETFs.</p>
<p>At press time, BTC traded at $70,158.</p>
<img alt="Bitcoin price" class="size-full wp-image-289993" height="472" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/BTCUSD_2024-03-27_12-28-24.png?resize=1024%2C472" width="1024" />

<title>Ripple CTO Responds To Dev’s Decision To End XRP Contribution</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-cto-responds-to-dev-nulls-disconnection/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章讨论了Ripple Labs首席技术官David “JoelKatz” Schwartz对New Dev Null Productions停止对XRP及其生态系统的贡献的看法。Dev Null Productions决定终止对XRP生态系统的贡献，指责Ripple的领导层出售XRP损害零售投资者利益。Schwartz表示即使有持有XRP的愿望，卖出这种数字货币几乎是不可避免的。他还谈到了XRP分配的挑战以及社区成员提出的关于采取其他行动的建议。文章还提到Dev Null Productions多年来为XRP生态系统提供的重要支持和贡献。Schwartz解释了分配XRP时面临的困难和无法解决这个问题的情况。 <div>
<p>Ripple Labs Chief Technology Officer (CTO) David &#8220;JoelKatz&#8221; Schwartz has <a href="https://x.com/JoelKatz/status/1772755924228415745?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">weighed</a> in on New Dev Null Productions&#8217; choice to cease its contribution towards XRP and its ecosystem, offering perspective on the development.</p>
<h2>Ripple CTO Advocates For XRP</h2>
<p>On Tuesday, Dev Null Productions <a href="https://devnullprod.com/article/adieu-xrp" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> its decision to discontinue its contribution to XRP and its ecosystem, which the company dubbed &#8220;The end of an era,&#8221; triggering speculations within the community.</p>

<p>The company stated that one of its reasons for cutting ties with the payment firm boils down to faith or rather the absence of it. Additionally, the decision of Ripple&#8217;s top leadership to sell its XRP at the cost of retail investors served as the major driver for the firm&#8217;s action.</p>
<p>Dev Null believes that by taking this step, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/march-26-pivotal-for-ripple-xrp/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ripple</a> has demonstrated that the people in charge do not have enough faith in XRP to give up short-term financial benefits that come at the expense of the hardworking community. </p>
<p>Even though the leaders talk well in front of cameras or an audience, Dev Null believes they still lack transparency and accountability to the people they owe their success to, noting that actions speak louder than words.</p>
<p>Responding to the firm&#8217;s claims, Schwartz stated that even if you wish to hold XRP, selling the coin is almost impossible to avoid. David Schwarts then drew attention to a previous post regarding the tax implications involved in obtaining XRP from the company.</p>
<p>Offering an instance, Schwarts noted that if Ripple awarded him a bonus of 1 million <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-price-face-melting-rally/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">XRP</a> tomorrow, he would be forced to sell roughly half of it right away. This is because he has a marginal tax rate of nearly 50% on earned income from both Federal (Fed) and California (CA) states. </p>
<p>Without a doubt, Dev Null Productions has been a significant contributor to the XRP ecosystem, supporting several events and developments within the ecosystem. In the past six years, the company has been a sole supporter of the NYC/XRP meetup, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-swell-xrp-product-rebrand-new-partners/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ripple Swell event</a>, Ripple Drop Interview, Rippled source code, Xrpintel &#8211; the first independent XRP data and analytics projects, San Francisco Blockchain Week, and among others.</p>
<h2>Difficulty In Distribution The Crypto Asset</h2>
<p>Addressing the concerns about XRP&#8217;s distribution, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-cto-breaks-down-the-amm-feature/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ripple CTO</a> claims the process is somewhat challenging. According to Schwartz, there is a common complaint among community members that the distribution is too concentrated, followed by complaints that there is too much distribution. Thus, this tends to remain this way as there is nothing more that can be done, and there are no available options.</p>

<p>However, the community seems to disagree with Schwartz as a member offered an option saying the company should purchase something else that moves and makes money.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the event that we take no action with our XRP, the distribution stays concentrated,&#8221; Schwarts <a href="https://x.com/JoelKatz/status/1772762338246213692?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">responded</a>, since the concentration of XRP with Ripple is a common and valid complaint within the community.</p>

<title>Morgan Stanley Set To Approve Bitcoin ETFs In The Next 2 Weeks: Insider</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/morgan-stanley-bitcoin-etfs-2-weeks-insider/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章首先提到，据报导，摩根士丹利将在接下来的两周内批准比特币ETF。这一新闻由加密评论家Andrew通过X平台首次披露。Eric Balchunas也表达了乐观态度。此外，摩根士丹利计划在其经纪业务中引入现货比特币ETF产品。最近，美国市场上有10个现货比特币ETF，其中财新和富达的FBTC资产领先。这一举措显示了现货比特币ETF与传统金融服务的日益融合。BTC当前的交易价格为70,594美元。 <div>
<p>The Bitcoin space is on the verge of a monumental shift, with insider reports emerging that Morgan Stanley, a titan in the financial sector, is poised to approve Bitcoin ETFs on its platform within the next two weeks. This groundbreaking news was first brought to light by renowned crypto commentator Andrew from Arch Public (@AP_Abacus) via X (formerly Twitter).</p>
<p>According to Andrew, &#8220;UPDATE: several sources confirming that Morgan Stanley is set to approve Bitcoin ETF&#8217;s on their platform in the next two weeks. Sources are from inside MS, inside BTC ETF firms, and legal insiders adjacent to both. Morgan Stanley holds more than $1.5T in client assets.&#8221; This statement has stirred considerable interest and speculation across the financial and BTC communities.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Eric Balchunas, a Bloomberg ETF expert, in response to Andrew&#8217;s tweet, showcased a blend of optimism and skepticism by stating, &#8220;Feels right, not doubting you, but what&#8217;s the source?&#8221; Andrew, maintaining the confidentiality of his informants, replied succinctly with &#8220;DM,&#8221; indicating a private message discussion for further details.</p>
<h2>Will Morgan Stanley Offer Bitcoin ETFs To Its Clients?</h2>
<p>This revelation is not entirely unexpected, as rumors about Morgan Stanley&#8217;s interest in BTC ETFs have been circulating since late February. Reports suggest that the financial behemoth has been engaged in due diligence processes to incorporate spot Bitcoin ETF products into its brokerage offerings. This information came from individuals familiar with the matter.</p>

<p>Morgan Stanley, a vanguard in alternative investments and private markets, boasting over $150 billion in assets under management, made headlines in 2021 as the first major US bank to provide its affluent clientele with access to BTC funds. During its first-quarter earnings call in April 2021, the wealth management giant confirmed its move to expose its wealth management clients to Bitcoin through two external crypto funds. These funds, understood to have been offered by <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/galaxy-digital-delays-ethereum-etf-launch-to-may-how-will-this-impact-eth-price-in-feb-2024/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Galaxy Digital</a> and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-spot-etf-nydig-predicts-30-billion-demand/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">NYDIG</a>, marked the bank&#8217;s initial foray into Bitcoin.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/breaking-spot-bitcoin-etfs-approved-by-us-sec/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">introduction of spot BTC ETFs</a> in the United States, approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in January, represented a watershed moment for the industry. Despite billions of dollars already being channelled into these products, their full potential is anticipated to be unleashed once they become available through major Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) networks and broker-dealer platforms, including those affiliated with prominent firms like Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, and Wells Fargo.</p>

<p>Since yesterday, the US market hosts 10 spot bitcoin ETFs, with <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-gobbles-up-nearly-196000-btc/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">BlackRock&#8217;s IBIT</a> and Fidelity&#8217;s FBTC leading in assets. The exact ETFs Morgan Stanley intends to offer remain unspecified, though the firm&#8217;s history suggests a strategic selection process favoring both innovation and client interest.</p>
<p>Morgan Stanley&#8217;s forthcoming decision to approve Bitcoin ETFs underscores the increasing integration of spot Bitcoin ETFs within traditional financial services. This move, if confirmed, could significantly influence the market, further fueling inflows into these ETFs.</p>
<p>At press time, BTC traded at $70,594.</p>

<title>Betting Against Bitcoin? Short Sellers Stake $11 Billion Against Crypto-Linked Stock Rise</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-short-sellers-bet-against-crypto-stock/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-short-sellers-bet-against-crypto-stock/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。虽然加密货币市场出现看涨的势头，比特币价格显着上涨，但空头卖方持怀疑态度，押注加密货币相关股票会下跌。空头利润减少60亿美元，但他们并未放弃，继续加大对该领域的空头仓位。这可能导致加密货币相关股票出现空头挤压的风险，使短空头不得不购买股票以退出，推高价格。此外，加密货币市场也受到巨额平仓影响，涵盖了潜在的风险和挤压。 <div>
<p>Despite the bullish momentum witnessed in the cryptocurrency market, fueled by a significant uptick in Bitcoin&#8217;s price, skepticism among short sellers <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/short-sellers-bet-11-billion-that-crypto-stock-rally-won-t-last-1.2051859" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">persists</a>, and billions of dollars have been wagered on the downturn of cryptocurrency-linked <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-reaches-trillion-dollar-valuation-how-it-stacks-up-to-stocks-gold-more/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">stocks</a>.</p>
<p>For context, Short sellers are investors who speculate that a stock&#8217;s or other asset&#8217;s price will decline. They borrow shares of the asset from a broker and sell them on the open market at the current price.</p>
<p>They aim to buy back the same number of shares later at a lower price, return the borrowed shares to the broker, and pocket the difference as profit.</p>

<h2>Betting Against Bitcoin? The Short Selling Surge</h2>
<p>According to Bloomberg, citing a recent report from S3 Partners LLC, the short interest in the cryptocurrency-linked stock sector has escalated to approximately $11 billion this year, indicating a substantial bet against the sustainability of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-correlation-dollar-index-stocks-disappeared/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">current rally</a>.</p>
<p>Notably, most of this short interest targets MicroStrategy Inc. and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/paradigm-industry-titans-rallying-behind-coinbase/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Coinbase Global Inc.</a>, accounting for over 80% of the total bets against the crypto sector.</p>
<img alt="Bet against crypto-linked stock sorted by highest." height="349" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.bnnbloomberg.ca/polopoly_fs/1.2051860.1711472050!/fileimage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/landscape_620/image.png?resize=620%2C349&#038;ssl=1" width="620" />
<p>This contrarian stance has resulted in paper losses nearing $6 billion for short sellers, as Bitcoin&#8217;s year-to-date gain of over 150% buoyed cryptocurrency-linked stocks. Despite these losses, short sellers appear undeterred, intensifying their positions against the sector.</p>
<p>According to Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3, the increase in short selling is a strategy some investors employ to either anticipate a &#8220;pullback&#8221; in Bitcoin&#8217;s rally or hedge against direct <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-mining-stocks-bitcoin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin investments</a>.</p>
<h2>Risks And Potential Squeezes</h2>
<p>The persistence of short sellers in targeting crypto-linked stocks poses risks, particularly if the market does not align with their bearish forecasts. Several stocks within this sector, including <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/microstrategy-1-of-all-bitcoin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">MicroStrategy</a>, Coinbase, and Cleanspark Inc., are identified as susceptible to short squeezes, according to Bloomberg, citing S3.</p>
<p>This phenomenon occurs when short sellers are compelled to purchase stocks to exit their losing positions, inadvertently driving prices up and exerting additional pressure on other short sellers.</p>
<p>So far this year, MicroStrategy&#8217;s stock has surged by roughly 167%, while Coinbase and Cleanspark have experienced gains of 58.60% and 85.16%, respectively, highlighting the potential for significant short squeezes.</p>
<p>Amid these market dynamics, the broader cryptocurrency sector has also seen substantial liquidations. Data from Coinglass indicates that over $190 million worth of positions have been liquidated in the last 24 hours alone.</p>
<img alt="Crypto market liquidations heatmap." class="wp-image-289806 size-large" height="532" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-26-at-18.34.59.png?resize=980%2C532" width="980" />
<p>Most of these liquidations were long positions, accounting for approximately 61.45%. Binance traders bore the brunt of these liquidations, experiencing losses of $81.33 million, surpassing the liquidations on OKX, which amounted to $70 million.</p>

<p>This period of liquidations coincides with a slight retracement in Bitcoin&#8217;s price from its 24-hour high above $71,000 to a current trading price of $69,879 at the time of writing.</p>

<title>Battle Over ‘Sam Coins’: FTX Customers Demand Millions From Bankrupt Crypto Firm</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/battle-over-sam-coins-ftx-customers-demand-millions/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/battle-over-sam-coins-ftx-customers-demand-millions/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是负面的。FTX客户要求对Sam Coins进行更高估值，与涉及创始人Sam Bankman-Fried的欺诈活动有关。客户要求数亿美元的赔偿，与FTX进行法律决战。FTX声称其他客户将获得全额赔偿。文章还提到了与Sam Bankman-Fried有关的三种数字代币的交易趋势。 <div>
<p>FTX customers are demanding substantial payouts from the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-set-to-cash-in-884-million-from-sale-anthropic/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">bankrupt crypto firm</a>. These customers claim three digital tokens, known as &#8220;Sam Coins,&#8221; deserve a higher value despite their association with convicted co-founder Sam Bankman-Fried.</p>
<h2>Investors Push For Higher Valuation</h2>
<p>According to a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-26/ftx-crypto-creditors-fight-claim-that-sam-coins-are-worthless?sref=2jPYL79S" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, the investors holding tokens called Serum, MAPS, and OXY are urging US Bankruptcy Judge John Dorsey to override the company&#8217;s experts&#8217; conclusion that the tokens are “nearly worthless.” </p>
<p>Notably,<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-50-years/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> Sam Bankman-Fried</a>, who created Serum and obtained control over the other two tokens, was involved in securing deals related to them, as mentioned in court documents.</p>

<p>When FTX filed for bankruptcy in November 2022, the company held a significant majority of the tokens, far exceeding what could be sold, even without considering the fraudulent activities that led to its collapse, as the company argued in a court filing.</p>
<p>The firm’s advisers have proposed that the tokens should be valued at a minimal amount, possibly just a few cents. However, the token holders argue that this estimate is “flawed” and have presented their <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-bankruptcy-trade-turns-into-legal-showdown/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">valuation method</a> in court, suggesting that the tokens are worth hundreds of millions of dollars. They have filed claims demanding payment based on their calculations.</p>
<h2>FTX Customers Prepare For Legal Showdown</h2>
<p>FTX&#8217;s lawyers state that other former customers will likely receive full reimbursement for their investments on the trading platform before bankruptcy. These customers had invested in US dollars, Bitcoin (BTC), and other assets that still hold value today. </p>
<p>The case between the customers and FTX is scheduled to reach its final arguments on Tuesday before Judge Dorsey in federal court in Wilmington, Delaware.</p>
<p>Per the report, the &#8220;Sam Coins&#8221; played a significant role in this fraudulent scheme, as asserted by bankruptcy officials. While these tokens had distinct names, they were colloquially called &#8220;Sam Coins&#8221; due to their close association with Bankman-Fried.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Sam Bankman-Fried was <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftxs-sam-bankman-fried-should-receive-50-year-jail/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">convicted </a>of fraud for improperly transferring customer assets to a hedge fund under his control. The funds were subsequently utilized for high-risk investments, political donations, and expensive real estate, ultimately leading to the collapse of the FTX empire.</p>
<img alt="FTX" class="size-large" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/DCRLaVvO/" width="1815" />
<p>At present, the native token of the exchange, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-drops-bombshell-lawsuit/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">FTT</a>, is trading at $2.15, reflecting a 3% decline in price over the past 24 hours. However, the token has witnessed significant gains in recent months, accumulating a total growth of 65%.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the three coins associated with Bankman-Fried display varying trends. Serum (SRM) has experienced a decline of over 5% in the past 24 hours and is currently valued at $0.06318. </p>
<p>On the other hand, MAPS is trading at $0.03549, demonstrating an upward trend of 9.4% during the same time frame. Lastly, Oxygen (OXY) stands at $0.01629, showcasing a notable surge of 15% within the given period.</p>

<title>Russian Crypto Firms Face Sanctions By US Treasury For “Supporting Evasion”</title>

<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/russian-crypto-firms-face-sanctions-by-us-treasury-for-supporting-evasion/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。美国财政部对与俄罗斯有关的加密公司实施了新一轮制裁，以打击OFAC指定实体通过虚拟资产服务规避制裁。共有13家实体和2名个人被指控协助交易和提供加密服务，帮助规避制裁。其中，Bitpapa和Netex24被分析研究公司Chainalysis列入制裁名单，帮助规避制裁实体。这两家公司的交易历史显示，它们与被制裁实体和暗网市场有着重要联系，转移了数百万美元的加密货币。对这些通过加密服务绕过制裁的实体加强打击，是美国政府持续努力的一部分。 <div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) announced a new round of sanctions on crypto-related companies linked to Russia. The measure is part of the US government’s efforts to combat OFAC-designated entities from evading sanctions through virtual asset services.</p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">OFAC Designates Russia-Linked Crypto Companies</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The US treasury has recently <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy2204" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">designated</a> thirteen entities and two individuals for allegedly facilitating transactions and offering crypto services to help “evade sanctions.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The new designations target companies servicing Russia’s core financial infrastructure for operating in the “financial services and technology sectors of the Russian Federation economy.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The list includes Russia-based and Russia-linked individuals developing and offering virtual asset services that &#8220;enable the evasion of US sanctions by OFAC-designated entities.&#8221;</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The move bans all transactions and interactions between the designated entities and US individuals. It is part of OFAC and the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/g7-to-create-strategy-for-crypto/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">G7’s efforts</a> against the evasion of sanctions and export control measures from the designated parties.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Brian E. Nelson, Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Russia is increasingly turning to alternative payment mechanisms to circumvent U.S. sanctions and continue to fund its war against Ukraine. As the Kremlin seeks to leverage entities in the financial technology space, Treasury will continue to expose and disrupt the companies that seek to help sanctioned Russian financial institutions reconnect to the global financial system.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">On-Chain Data Unveils Bitpapa And Netex24 Assistance In Sanctions Evasion</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Blockchain research firm Chainalysis <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/ofac-sanctions-russia-blockchain-companies-netex24-bitpapa/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">released</a> a report analyzing two of the newly OFAC-designated entities: Netex24, a Moscow-based fintech company that operates as a crypto exchange, and Bitpapa, a peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange that facilitates payments for Russian crypto businesses on OFAC’s list.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">According to the report, both companies have facilitated significant transactions to sanction entities over the past two years.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The company identified “clusters associated with both services using on-chain data.” The report highlights that exchanges without Know Your Customer (KYC) controls and darknet markets make up a significant portion of the companies’ transaction history.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">These transactions include Russian-language sites offering “on and off ramping with sanctioned Russian banks.” The two companies have registered massive fund outflows sent for seemingly illegal purposes.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="crypto, Russia sanctions " class="size-large wp-image-289814 aligncenter" height="538" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/cumulative-value-800x538-1.png?w=800&#038;resize=800%2C538" width="800" /></p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">According to Chainalysis, Bitpapa registered 52% of outflows to Sanctioned entities and 32.6% to darknet markets from October 2019 until March 2024. Meanwhile, Netex24 exhibits 46.7% of outflows to darknet markets and 23.4% to sanctioned entities from October 2016 until March 2024.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The cumulative value sent from these companies to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-sanctions-imposed-by-these-3-countries/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">sanctioned</a> parties increased since 2022, when Russia’s war in Ukraine started. As the chart above shows, the darknet market transactions increased alongside those of sanctioned entities during this timeframe, rising above $75 million since the second half of 2023.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Per the report, both entities transferred millions of dollars worth of crypto to Hydra Market and crypto exchange Garantex. Additionally, the companies facilitated transactions for several pro-Russia militia and propaganda groups, including OFAC-designated MOO Veche.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The US government has intensified its efforts against entities bypassing sanctions through crypto-related services. A round of sanctions was imposed in January on the platforms involved in the facilitation of crypto transactions linked to the terrorist group Hamas as part of the ongoing efforts for</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, The US has severely targeted <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/coinbase-treasury-letter-opposing-crypto-regulation/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">crypto mixers</a> for the misuse of these privacy tools by criminal actors, including bans on Tornado Cash and its founder, which has raised concerns in the crypto community.</p>

<title>Ethereum Spot ETF On Thin Ice? Expert Predicts 25% Approval Odds Amid SEC Silence</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-spot-etf-expert-predicts-approval-odds/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-spot-etf-expert-predicts-approval-odds/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。美国证券交易委员会（SEC）正在审批以太坊现货交易所交易基金（ETF），但Bloomberg的ETF高级分析师Eric Balchunas认为，以太坊现货ETF获得批准的可能性仅为25％。SEC对以太坊的分类和监管态度令人担忧，最近对加密公司发出“传票”，引发了对将以太坊归类为证券的猜测。在这种监管不确定性下，以太坊的市场表现尽管不错，但以太坊现货ETF的未来仍存疑。 <div>
<p>The discussion surrounding approving a spot Ethereum exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is intensifying as the decision announcement date rapidly approaches.</p>
<p>Bloomberg&#8217;s Senior ETF Analyst, Eric Balchunas, has <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1772372601098162624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">shared</a> a rather cautious outlook, estimating the likelihood of an ETH spot ETF receiving the green light at a mere 25%.</p>

<h2>Ethereum Slight Chance To A Spot ETF Approval</h2>
<p>Skepticism about the unlikelihood of a spot ETH ETF approval is rooted in what Balchunas perceives as deliberate non-engagement from the SEC rather than mere procrastination, leading to an absence of positive indicators for approval in the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/uk-embraces-crypto-bitcoin-and-ethereum-etns-coming-to-london-stock-exchange/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">current environment</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Re Eth ETF approval, we are holding the line at 25% odds altho tbh it is a very pessimistic 25%. The lack of engagement seems to be purposeful vs procrastination. No positive signs/intel anywhere you look. Personally hope they do approve it but it just ain&#8217;t looking good. <a href="https://t.co/nuBdCDE18L" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">https://t.co/nuBdCDE18L</a></p>
<p>— Eric Balchunas (@EricBalchunas) <a href="https://twitter.com/EricBalchunas/status/1772372601098162624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">March 25, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The debate over the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sec-delays-decision-on-grayscales-ethereum-etf-here/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">SEC&#8217;s stance</a> on a potential Ethereum spot ETF is nuanced, with opinions divided within the industry. On the one hand, Balchunas has expressed disappointment over the lack of encouraging signs for Ethereum spot ETF approval despite holding out hope for a positive outcome.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Craig Salm, Grayscale&#8217;s Chief Legal Officer, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-spot-etf-mirrors-bitcoins-strength/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">offers a different perspective</a>, suggesting that the SEC&#8217;s silence should not be<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/elon-musk-queries-ethereum-founder-buterin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> interpreted negatively</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">2/ In the final months leading up to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#Bitcoin</a> ETF approval, <a href="https://twitter.com/Grayscale?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">@Grayscale</a> and others received positive and constructive engagement from the SEC. We had thoughtful conversations and discussed the finer details of creation/redemption procedures, cash v. in-kind, APs, LPs, custody etc.</p>
<p>— Craig Salm (@CraigSalm) <a href="https://twitter.com/CraigSalm/status/1772360838793384389?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">March 25, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Salm argues that many operational details relevant to an Ethereum spot ETF have already been addressed during the approval process for the spot Bitcoin ETF, implying that fewer aspects might require engagement this time around.</p>
<h2>Ethereum&#8217;s Market Performance Amid Regulatory Uncertainty</h2>
<p>Despite <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-ceo-predicts-sec-setback-in-ethereum-case/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">varying opinions</a> on the implications of the SEC&#8217;s current engagement levels, the agency&#8217;s actions indicate a cautious approach toward Ethereum and its classification.</p>
<p>Recent moves by the SEC, including <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/03/20/sec-gary-gensler-ethereum-security-commodity-crypto-foundation/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">issuing</a> &#8220;subpoenas&#8221; to crypto firms about their interactions with the Ethereum Foundation, have fueled speculation about a campaign to classify Ethereum as a security.</p>
<p>This development, coupled with the regulatory body&#8217;s historical hesitance towards cryptocurrency ETFs, casts doubt on the immediate future of a spot ETH ETF.</p>

<p>Amid this regulatory uncertainty, ETH&#8217;s market performance has been noteworthy. In the past week alone, the cryptocurrency has seen a 10% increase in value, with its price trading above $3,500 at the time of writing.</p>

<title>SEC Faces Lawsuit Over Crypto Airdrops, Defendants Push For Non-Security Status</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/sec-lawsuit-over-crypto-airdrops-defendants-push/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/sec-lawsuit-over-crypto-airdrops-defendants-push/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的<br />美国证券交易委员会（SEC）面临一场新的诉讼，挑战监管机构未能清晰为加密行业提供分类，特别是关于将加密空投分类为证券的失败。起诉书由DeFi教育基金（DEF）和总部位于德克萨斯州的服装公司Beba Collection提起，旨在促使法院裁定BEBA代币不属于投资契约类别。起诉书主要关注SEC对BEBA代币的处理以及违反行政程序法的行为。DEF和Beba认为，该案的结果将对加密行业产生重大影响，为行业提供重要的清晰度。 <div>
<p>The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is facing a new lawsuit that aims to challenge the regulator&#8217;s failure to provide a clear <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sec-commissioner-crypto-regulation-enforcement/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">regulatory framework</a> for the crypto industry, specifically regarding classifying crypto airdrops as securities. </p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed by the DeFi Education Fund (DEF) and Beba Collection, an apparel company based in Texas, seeks to prompt the court to rule that the BEBA token does not fall under the category of a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/turkey-nears-completion-crypto-regulation-framework/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">securities </a>investment contract.</p>
<h2>Lawsuit Targets SEC&#8217;s Treatment Of BEBA Token</h2>
<p>In their <a href="https://x.com/fund_defi/status/1772277649227878560?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>, the DeFi Education Fund expressed concerns over the SEC&#8217;s “aggressive enforcement actions,” which they believe pose an existential threat to the crypto industry. The lawsuit focuses on two claims. </p>
<p>First, Beba Collection requests a declaratory judgment stating that BEBA tokens are not investment contracts and that the free airdrop of BEBA tokens for marketing purposes does not constitute a securities transaction. </p>

<p>Second, the DeFi Education Fund and Beba argue that the SEC violated the Administrative Procedure Act by adopting a policy that treats nearly all crypto assets as investment contracts and digital asset transactions as securities transactions.</p>
<p>Regarding crypto airdrops, Beba Collection asserts that the free distribution of BEBA tokens does not involve an &#8220;investment of money,&#8221; a key requirement under the Howey test for determining <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/peirce-slams-secs-move-to-target-crypto-auditors/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">investment contracts</a>. According to Beba, no investment contract exists since the tokens were given away without monetary investment from recipients.</p>
<h2>Crypto Industry Strikes Back</h2>
<p>The second claim focuses on the SEC&#8217;s compliance with the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), which requires agencies to adopt <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/brazil-to-introduce-tougher-crypto-regulation/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">new rules</a> openly and with public input. </p>
<p>DEF and Beba argue that the SEC implemented a radical new policy under Chairman Gensler&#8217;s leadership without providing the required opportunity for public comment. The DeFi Education Fund further alleged:</p>
<blockquote><p>Instead, the SEC ramped up its enforcement actions, hired more people to make them happen, and created a “who’s next?” fear in the industry. The natural outcome of the SEC’s actions is: “cross your fingers and hope the SEC does not come knocking on your door.” We can’t allow this state of play to continue.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ultimately, DEF suggested that the outcome of this case could have significant implications. A ruling in favor of DEF and Beba that the SEC&#8217;s approach to crypto violates the APA would be a major obstacle to the SEC&#8217;s ongoing “regulatory overreach.” </p>
<p>Additionally, if the court determines that BEBA tokens are not investment contracts and that free <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/mark-cuban-takes-jab-at-sec/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">airdrops </a>are not securities transactions, it would provide much-needed clarity to the industry.</p>

<p>As the lawsuit unfolds, the crypto community and industry stakeholders eagerly await the court&#8217;s decision, hoping for a favorable outcome that promotes innovation, fosters regulatory clarity, and curtails excessive enforcement actions by the SEC.</p>

<title>Pro-XRP Lawyer Sees 40% Settlement Odds For Ripple-SEC After Ruling</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/pro-xrp-lawyer-ripple-sec-settlement-odds-40/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/pro-xrp-lawyer-ripple-sec-settlement-odds-40/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。文章讨论了SEC对瑞波实验室提出的2亿美元罚款的请求，并解释了SEC如何指控瑞波公司在XRP销售中的不当行为。文章还分析了一位支持XRP的律师对SEC文件的评论，强调了对瑞波公司的影响以及可能的结局。律师认为SEC的动作可能导致两种结果：一种是对瑞波有利的和解，另一种是进入第二轮的上诉。 最后，XRP的实时交易价格为0.63美元。 <div>
<p>In an escalation of the ongoing legal battle between Ripple Labs and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the regulatory agency has advanced its position by <a href="https://twitter.com/FilanLaw/status/1772466842524582296" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">filing</a> a Motion for Remedies and Entry of Final Judgment, which notably includes a request for a $2 billion penalty against Ripple.</p>
<p>Fred Rispoli, a pro-XRP lawyer and founder of HODL Law, has provided a detailed <a href="https://twitter.com/freddyriz/status/1772441439823077550" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">analysis</a> of the SEC’s motion through a series of comments on X (formerly Twitter). Rispoli’s breakdown offers an insider perspective on the potential outcomes and strategies at play.</p>
<p>He noted, &#8220;#XRPcommunity The SEC&#8217;s motion for judgment has been publicly filed. TLDR: SEC is following the playbook I outlined two months ago,&#8221; reflecting on the predictability of the SEC&#8217;s actions but also underscoring the gravity of the situation for Ripple.</p>
<h2>SEC Puts Ripple In Trouble</h2>
<p>Rispoli’s analysis highlights several key points from the SEC&#8217;s filing, with particular emphasis on the claim that Ripple offered significant discounts on XRP sales to certain <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sec-victory-ripple-disclosure-financial-statements/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">institutional buyers</a>. The SEC argues that there were two groups of institutional sales investors while Ripple offered one group significant discounts in XRP price over the other group that did not receive them.</p>
<p>This practice, according to the SEC, not only skewed some institutional sales investors but also potentially disadvantaged retail investors. The lawyer credited the agency for this tactical move.</p>

<p>“It realized that it needs to show how investors were actually harmed. Ripple has already said the SEC&#8217;s motion is full of mischaracterizations. Let&#8217;s hope that is correct because the picture painted is not a good look for Ripple and lends credence to the XRP haters on why the price is so low. Namely, the deep discounts by Ripple on XRP sales,” Rispoli stated.</p>
<p>At the same time, he expressed concerns over these revelation, stating, &#8220;If discounts are wide enough, then Institutional Buyers (like GSR) scored unbelievable discounts and have bags-upon-bags of XRP that they could continually sell at astronomical profit,&#8221; pointing to a potential imbalance in the investment landscape fostered by Ripple’s actions.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Rispoli shed light on the SEC&#8217;s portrayal of Ripple’s business practices, notably the company&#8217;s continuation of XRP sales as its primary revenue source, even after legal scrutiny intensified. He elaborates, &#8220;SEC claims the financial discovery it received by court order demonstrates this is by far and away Ripple&#8217;s primary source of revenue,&#8221; suggesting a critical view of Ripple&#8217;s dependency on these sales amidst ongoing litigation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the document also reveals that Ripple is still signing contracts with institutional buyers. Since the start of the XRP lawsuit in December 2020, the company has signed 80 contracts.</p>
<h2>Pro-XRP Lawyer Predicts Two Possible Outcomes</h2>
<p>The classification of Ripple&#8217;s<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-clo-clarifies-xrp-is-not-used-liquidity-hub/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> On-Demand Liquidity (ODL)</a> transactions represents another crucial aspect of Rispoli’s analysis. The legal determination of whether these transactions constitute unlawful sales or are permissible under law is a significant factor that could influence Ripple&#8217;s operational latitude.</p>
<p>&#8220;Stakes are very high here,&#8221; Rispoli asserts, adding, “we have to hope Ripple has sufficiently changed its business practices to account for Torres&#8217; ruling.”</p>
<p>The potential consequences of the SEC’s motion are profound, with Rispoli speculating on the likelihood of a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-vs-sec-lawsuit-may-result-in-settlement/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">settlement</a>. He assessed, &#8220;This motion is of enormous consequence,” with two options on how this ends:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>One, the amount ordered by the court is low enough and rulings on newly-structured sales favorable enough (to Ripple) that there is a final settlement after the ruling. I&#8217;m now putting this at 40% odds. More likely is this will come out favorable to Ripple on the amount of money owed but that Ripple takes hits on what is allowed going forward, meaning this is going to an appeal to the 2nd.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>At press time, XRP traded at $0.63.</p>

<title>Shiba Inu On The Rise: Here Are The Latest Developments Driving Bullish Sentiment</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-latest-developments-2/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-latest-developments-2/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。Shiba Inu（SHIB）生态系统的发展趋势积极，长期持有者数量增加，市场表现乐观。SHIB的销毁计划和Shibarium的创新也为进一步增长奠定基础。此外，市场营销努力也取得成功，吸引了更多用户参与生态系统，推动了活跃用户数量的增加。当前SHIB价格为0.00002914美元。 <div>
<p>Several <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inus-shibarium-hits-new-record-amid-chaotic-market-movements/">developments and happenings</a> in the Shiba Inu (SHIB) ecosystem continue to highlight the crypto token’s growth. These fundamentals also hint at <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-surge-crypto-shib/#:~:text=Shiba%20Inu%20To%20See%20A%20300%25%20Gain%20Before%20Year%2Dend&amp;text=Looking%20at%20SHIB&#039;s%20chart%2C%20the,invest%20in%20the%20crypto%20token.">SHIB’s price</a> being primed for further <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-dogecoin-shib-excitement/">moves to the upside</a>. </p>
<h2>The SHIB Army Is Resilient</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-0-001-9-25-trillion-shib/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Shiba Inu team member Ragnar</a> drew the community’s attention to the rise in the number of SHIB’s long-term holders in less than a year despite the meme coin’s tepid price movement at some point. Data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock showed that the number of addresses holding $10 million worth of SHIB has grown from 57 to 209 since June 2023. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, there has also been an uptick in the number of addresses holding $1 million worth of SHIB, with 1319 addresses falling under this category. This information underscores the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-team-discloses-projects-true-strength/#:~:text=The%20Shiba%20Inu%20team%20unveiled,commonly%20referred%20to%20as%20ShibArmy.">SHIB community’s faith</a> in the meme coin and how they have continued to remain bullish even when there wasn’t enough reason to do so. </p>
<p>In another X (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/RagnarShiba/status/1772380489627713731?s=20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, Ragnar highlighted how Shiba Inu’s burning program and innovations to Shibarium are setting SHIB up for further growth. So far, SHIB Burns, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-shib-burns/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">a community initiative</a>, has continued to positively impact the meme coin’s price whenever it is carried out. </p>
<p>These <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-burns-bright-shib/">token burns</a> have also increased with the help of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shibarium-public/">layer-2 network Shibarium</a>, with the team committing to converting some of the network fees to SHIB and burning them. Meanwhile, with the advancements in Shibarium, network activity is expected to pick up again, which would ultimately lead to more SHIB tokens being burnt. </p>
<h2>Shiba Inu Marketing Has Also Helped</h2>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-latest-shib-magazine/">The Shiba Inu team</a> has also chosen not to rest on its laurels. They have continued to actively develop strategies to onboard new users into the ecosystem and maintain the bullish sentiment in the community. <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shib-2024/">Shiba Inu’s Marketing Lead, Lucie</a>, has led the way in this regard, actively promoting meme coin trading on Shibarium for some time now. </p>

<p>The reason for this isn’t farfetched, as the meme coin frenzy on networks like <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-network-forces-binance-to-halt-withdrawals/">Solana</a> and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/coinbase-base-opens-doors-featuring-100-dapps/">Base</a> has attracted more users and caused network activity to skyrocket. As such, the team is no doubt looking to lure some meme coin investors to the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shibarium-99-decline/">Shibarium network</a> in hopes that this will help the ecosystem gain more traction. </p>
<p>Their efforts already seem to be paying off, as their promotion of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inus-shibarium-hits-new-record-amid-chaotic-market-movements/">‘DAMN’ meme coin</a> has led to a rise in the number of daily active users on WoofSwap, a decentralized exchange (DEX) on Shibarium. </p>
<p>At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at around $0.00002914, up over 5% in the last 24 hours according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/shiba-inu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">data</a> from CoinMarketCap. </p>

<p>As pointed out by Litecoin Foundation Director of Marketing Jay Milla in a <a href="https://twitter.com/MillaLiraj/status/1772326693400887383" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, the total number of LTC addresses with a balance has grown recently.</p>

<p>Below is a chart using data from the market intelligence platform IntoTheBlock that shows how the total number of LTC addresses carrying a non-zero balance has changed since the start of the year:</p>
<p><img alt="Litecoin Addresses" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="956" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GJiRVtEaQAAdpQS?format=jpg&amp;name=large" width="1737" /></p>

<p>From the graph, it&#8217;s visible that the total number of LTC holders has been going up this year, with the metric recently managing to surpass the 8 million mark, a new milestone for the blockchain.</p>
<p>Uptrends in the indicator can arise from a few different things. The first and most obvious one is fresh <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-adoption-explodes-20x-shib-dethrone-doge/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">adoption</a>; brand new users coming into the network would naturally open up new addresses and add coins to them, thus raising the total holder count.</p>
<p>Another factor that may contribute to a rise in the metric is existing users opening up new addresses for themselves to divide their holdings, perhaps for a purpose like privacy.</p>
<p>Investors who had left the cryptocurrency earlier, making a return to the network, would also register as a rise in the indicator. In general, all of these factors may be in play at the same time, but the important fact is that a net amount of adoption is usually occurring when the metric goes up.</p>
<p>For any cryptocurrency network, adoption is a constructive sign, as it means that the coin is able to attract fresh attention to it. It, however, usually doesn&#8217;t impact the asset in the short-term.</p>
<p>According to Jay, the total number of Litecoin addresses with a balance has increased by more than 1 million within the past year alone, which would imply that the asset&#8217;s adoption has accelerated in this period.</p>
<p>Historically, the main attraction of the LTC blockchain has been the fact that it offers fast transactions at a cheap rate. It would appear that this quality is still driving interest behind the asset, but unfortunately for its investors, the growth hasn&#8217;t quite reflected in its price, as LTC has lagged behind its peers.</p>

<p>One upcoming development that may be positive for Litecoin, though, is the fact that on the first date of the coming month, the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase plans to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-coinbase-futures-listing/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">launch a futures product</a> for LTC.</p>
<h2>LTC Price</h2>
<p>Litecoin has been putting together some upward momentum recently, as its price has now crossed back above the $91 mark. The below chart shows how the asset has performed during the past few days.</p>
<p><img alt="Litecoin Price Chart" class="alignnone size-medium aligncenter" height="854" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/nDTNjrpu/" width="1534" /></p>

<p>While the LTC price is up 13% over the past week, these profits have still been weaker than its competitors, which is why the coin is currently only the 22nd largest in the sector based on <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/total-crypto-market-cap-to-hit-7-5-trillion-next-year/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">market cap</a>.</p>

<title>Shiba Inu Snags Silver: Memecoin Is Europe’s 2nd Most Beloved Crypto</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要: 这些信息是积极的。Shiba Inu (SHIB)作为领先的狗主题加密货币之一，引起了全球投资者的关注，成为欧洲搜索量第二高的加密货币。SHIB价格的快速上涨和对其前景的乐观预期吸引了投资者的关注，尤其是在欧洲。SHIB的全球社区强大且积极活跃，帮助其在竞争激烈的加密货币市场中脱颖而出。虽然与其他狗主题加密货币存在激烈竞争，但SHIB社区自信地宣称自己是加密货币世界的“头号狗”，展示了其竞争实力。 <div>
<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB), the leading canine-themed cryptocurrency, has captured the attention of investors worldwide, emerging as the second most searched cryptocurrency in Europe.</p>
<p>Surpassing established contenders like Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), and even its predecessor Dogecoin (DOGE), SHIB&#8217;s meteoric rise in popularity signals a significant shift in the cryptocurrency landscape.</p>

<p>The surge in interest comes on the heels of an impressive rally in SHIB&#8217;s price, with the token witnessing a staggering 300% increase over eight days in early March. Investors, both seasoned and new, found themselves captivated by SHIB&#8217;s impressive performance, reminiscent of its glory days in 2021.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-289685" height="59" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_093314.png?resize=933%2C59" width="933" /></p>

<p>The price of the memecoin has been rising over the last 24 hours, and it has made a failed attempt to break above the $0.3 resistance level. Even with this setback, the SHIB price&#8217;s tenacious development trajectory and durability point to the possibility of a positive breakout if the $0.00003 barrier is forcefully crossed.</p>
<h2><strong>Shiba Inu Bags No. 2 Spot As Second Most-Adored Crypto</strong></h2>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><img alt="🤯" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f92f.png" style="height: 1em;" /><img alt="🤯" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f92f.png" style="height: 1em;" /> SHIB is the 2nd most searched crypto in Europe only behind Bitcoin. The <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SHIBARMY?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">#SHIBARMY</a>&#8216;s unstoppable growth is only just beginning.

<p></p>
<p>Europe, in particular, has emerged as a hotbed of enthusiasm for SHIB, with data revealing that it ranks only behind Bitcoin (BTC) as the most searched cryptocurrency in the region. Seven European countries, including Italy, Russia, and France, witnessed a skyrocketing surge in online searches for SHIB, outpacing other major cryptocurrencies in the region.</p>
<h2><strong>Shiba Inu: Global Community Strength</strong></h2>
<p>Beyond Europe, SHIB&#8217;s appeal has transcended borders, with increased Google searches observed in countries such as Pakistan, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Canada, and Nigeria. This global interest underscores SHIB&#8217;s status as a truly international phenomenon, captivating the attention of investors across continents.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/Q2QvDzt2/" width="1835" /></p>

<p>One of the key factors driving SHIB&#8217;s popularity is its vibrant and dedicated community, as evidenced by its recent ranking as the number one meme-based cryptocurrency with the strongest community.</p>
<p>A poll conducted by WazirX revealed that SHIB garnered 48% of the total votes, outperforming rivals like Dogecoin, Floki Inu, Pepe, and Bonk. The SHIB community&#8217;s unwavering support and engagement have solidified its position as a force to be reckoned with in the cryptocurrency world.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-289691" height="399" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_338635.png?resize=1024%2C399" width="1024" /></p>


<p>However, amidst the euphoria surrounding SHIB&#8217;s ascent, it&#8217;s essential to acknowledge the competitive landscape within the cryptocurrency market. The rivalry between SHIB and other dog-themed cryptocurrencies, notably Dogecoin and Floki Inu, remains palpable.</p>
<p>The SHIB community&#8217;s confident assertion of being the &#8220;top dog&#8221; in the crypto world is a subtle nod to its competitors, highlighting the spirited competition that defines this niche market segment.</p>

<title>Dogecoin Developer Lauds New Use Case That Will Bring Added Utility For DOGE Users</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-developer-utility-doge/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-developer-utility-doge/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章首先介绍了开发人员提出的有关Dogecoin的全球用例的最新讨论，旨在提高其效用和功能性。开发人员指出，Dogecoin可以通过新的用例赋予无银行服务的人更多权力，例如使用RadioDoge建立金融自由。此外，文章强调了Dogecoin在改善全球金融安全和推动广泛采用方面的潜力，通过提供实际利益和解决方案来增强其效用。 <div>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-coinbase-futures-listing/">Dogecoin</a> has once again grabbed the attention of the broader crypto community, as a developer announces a groundbreaking new use case, aiming to boost utility and offer enhanced functionality for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-5-million-doge-holders/">DOGE users</a> globally.  </p>
<h2>Dogecoin To Empower The Unbanked</h2>
<p>In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-is-unresponsive-and-sick-developer/">Timothy Stebbing</a>, a developer for Dogecoin Foundation, <a href="https://x.com/tjstebbing/status/1772376076318335066?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">unveiled</a> an innovative new use case for Dogecoin, highlighting the impact <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-bullish-signal-doge/">DOGE transactions</a> could have in regions struggling to access traditional banking systems. </p>

<p>According to Stebbing, Dogecoin’s new use case is seen in its evolving role as an instrument for self-empowerment, emphasizing its ability to equip individuals with the necessary resources to improve their circumstances. He revealed that through this approach, “real utility is built for Dogecoin.”</p>
<p>Delving deeper into DOGE&#8217;s newly discovered use case, Stebbing highlighted a previous <a href="https://x.com/tjstebbing/status/1767840909130105342?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">discussion</a> he had in 2023 regarding RadioDoge, a decentralized communication and data transmission network. In his post, the developer described RadioDoge as a “means of bringing financial freedom to the unbanked.”</p>
<p>Recapping the discussion from last year, Stebbing unveiled multiple use cases for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-adoption-explodes-as-890000-new-addresses-are-added/">Dogecoin</a>, stressing the cryptocurrency’s potential to address the banking challenges faced by the underserved population. He revealed that by utilizing RadioDoge, individuals in small towns and villages lacking access to traditional banking systems can <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/x-dogecoin-payments-included/">use DOGE as a means of payment. </a></p>
<p>Additionally, given Dogecoin’s ability to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-usage-explodes-doge-processing-million-day/">provide more affordable and swifter transactions</a>, it could serve as a viable alternative for individuals who rely on banking systems like Western Union to transfer funds to family members abroad.  </p>
<p>In light of these advantages, Stebbing shared that he would be meeting with a member of an organization specializing in building self-managing saving plans for villages. The focal point of the meeting will revolve around exploring the potential impact of RadioDoge in regions where <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cfos-weigh-in-on-the-efficiency-costs-and-user-benefits-of-decentralized-finance-and-traditional-banking/">conventional banking infrastructure</a> remains elusive. </p>
<h2>Enhancing Utility To Create Widespread Adoption</h2>
<p>It’s well known that the utility of a cryptocurrency plays a vital role in its long-term value and adoption. And, according to Stebbing, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/wordpress-websites-can-now-accept-dogecoin-payments/">Dogecoin’s utility</a> focuses on providing support and solutions to populations without access to specific financial resources. </p>

<p>By <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/russia-approves-bitcoin-for-cross-border-payments/">facilitating cross-border transactions</a> and improving the financial security of individuals globally, Dogecoin stands as a cryptocurrency committed to enhancing the utility of its users through real-world applications. Stebbing has revealed that through added utility, Dogecoin stands to potentially <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-adoption-accelerates-fastest-doge-comeback/">gain widespread adoption</a>. </p>
<p>This is because cryptocurrencies that offer tangible benefits and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/6-cryptos-with-real-world-utility-and-growth-potential/">address real-world needs</a> often gain traction quickly among users. This rapid adoption subsequently <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-adoption-1100-price/">boosts the value</a> of the cryptocurrency. </p>

<title>Scoring A Win: Mastercard Endorses Ripple For Global Remittances – A Boost For XRP?</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/mastercard-endorses-ripple-for-global-remittances/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/mastercard-endorses-ripple-for-global-remittances/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要: 这些信息是积极的。在Mastercard最近的报告中，该公司承认了Ripple在拉丁美洲汇款领域的重要性，指出了传统汇款服务面临的挑战，并认可了Ripple的区块链技术作为潜在解决方案。报告还指出了Ripple在改变国际转账方式方面的潜力，以及预测了数字汇款市场的巨大增长。最终，Ripple在Mastercard报告中的认可导致其XRP价格出现显着上涨。 <div>
<p>Financial services giant Mastercard has given a significant nod to Ripple, a crypto-focused company, in a recent report exploring the future of remittances in Latin America. The report highlights the challenges of traditional remittance services and recognizes Ripple&#8217;s blockchain technology as a potential solution.</p>

<h2><strong>Ripple Gets Stamp Of Approval From Mastercard</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.mastercard.com/news/media/ltfpfln3/pcmi_mastercard_the_future_of_remittances_en_march2024.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">The Mastercard report</a> highlighted the critical role remittances play in Latin America. Citing UN data, it details how these cross-border payments are a lifeline for families and communities, especially in low and middle-income countries. Mexico, for instance, received a staggering $55 billion in remittances in 2022, making it the world&#8217;s largest recipient.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-289720" height="826" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_8ac19e.png?resize=811%2C826" width="811" /></p>
<h2><strong>Remittance Services Struggle With High Fees And Security Risks</strong></h2>
<p>However, the article identifies several pain points plaguing remittance services. High fees, heavy reliance on cash transactions, security concerns, and a lack of user-friendly digital experiences are major hurdles for users. These inefficiencies not only make sending and receiving money cumbersome but also eat into the already strained finances of many.</p>
<p>This is where Ripple steps in. The Mastercard report acknowledges Ripple, alongside Stellar and Circle, as pioneers in leveraging blockchain technology to revolutionize international money transfers. Blockchain&#8217;s core attributes, such as transparency and immutability, offer the potential for faster, more secure, and cost-effective remittance services.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ripple?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">#Ripple</a> cited a few times in the new MasterCard report, &#8220;The future of remittances in Latin America: Digitalization, multiple rails, &amp; the strategic role of partnerships&#8221; as an example of blockchain in remittances &amp; CBDCs. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/XRP?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">#XRP</a> not directly mentioned.
1/3<a href="https://t.co/6Wj2xOh73b" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://t.co/6Wj2xOh73b</a></p>
<p>— WrathofKahneman (@WKahneman) <a href="https://twitter.com/WKahneman/status/1772366065919558098?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">March 25, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>The report further shines a light on Ripple&#8217;s partner, SBI Remit. This Japanese money transfer service provider began using Ripple&#8217;s XRP cryptocurrency for cross-border transactions in three Asian countries last year. This development underscores the real-world application of Ripple&#8217;s technology in facilitating smoother and potentially cheaper remittances.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/CzS7AThO/" width="2475" /></p>

<p>Beyond remittances, Mastercard acknowledges Ripple&#8217;s work with island nation Palau in exploring central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). CBDCs are digital versions of a country&#8217;s fiat currency, potentially offering faster and more secure domestic and international payments.</p>
<strong>A $500 Billion Market By 2026</strong>
<p>Mastercard predicts the digital remittance market share to reach over $500 billion by 2026, reflecting an annual growth rate of nearly 10%. Interestingly, Ripple has a much bolder prediction, estimating the entire cross-border payment market to reach a staggering $250 trillion by 2027.</p>

<p>Mastercard&#8217;s recognition of Ripple is a significant development for the crypto company. It validates Ripple&#8217;s technology and its potential to address the long-standing issues plaguing remittance services, particularly in Latin America. While the two entities have different outlooks on market size, both agree on the significant growth potential in the cross-border payments sector.</p>





Following the news of Ripple&#8217;s recognition by Mastercard for XRP-based remittances, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">XRP</a> experienced a notable 3% rise in its price. This positive movement in XRP&#8217;s value reflects the market&#8217;s optimism and confidence in the potential collaboration between Ripple and Mastercard, signaling a favorable response to the integration of XRP into Mastercard&#8217;s payment network.

<title>KuCoin Charged By DOJ As ‘Money Laundering Hub’ In Alleged $9B Scheme</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/kucoin-faces-doj-prosecution/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/kucoin-faces-doj-prosecution/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。美国联邦检察官起诉加密货币交易所KuCoin及其两位创始人违反反洗钱法。指控他们故意违反反洗钱和银行保密法，并没有按照基本的反洗钱政策运营。调查声称KuCoin收到超过50亿美元，并发送了逾40亿美元的可疑和犯罪资金。检察部门称，KuCoin、Gan和Tang故意忽略反洗钱义务，直到2023年7月才开始实施了KYC计划。 Gan和Tang，两位中国籍公民如果被判有罪，每项违反银行保密法和未经注册的经营未许可的最高判刑为5年。当前，KCS代币的交易价格已经受到这一消息和DOJ提出的指控的影响，目前正在12.76美元进行交易，短短一个小时内下跌了10%。 <div>
<p>In a significant development, federal prosecutors in the United States have <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/prominent-global-cryptocurrency-exchange-kucoin-and-two-its-founders-criminally" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">charged </a>cryptocurrency exchange KuCoin and two of its founders with violating anti-money laundering (AML) laws.</p>
<h2>Founders Face DOJ Charges </h2>
<p>The US Department of Justice (DOJ) unsealed an indictment against KuCoin and its founders, Chun Gan (also known as &#8220;Michael&#8221;) and Ke Tang (also known as &#8220;Eric&#8221;), for their alleged involvement in conspiring to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business and conspiring to violate the Bank Secrecy Act. </p>
<p>The indictment accuses them of “willfully” failing to maintain an effective AML program designed to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing.</p>

<p>According to Damian Williams, the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, KuCoin deliberately concealed the fact that a significant number of its users were trading on its platform, and allegedly taking advantage of its US customer base to become one of the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. </p>
<p>However, the defendants allegedly failed to comply with US laws, including basic AML policies, allowing KuCoin to operate as a “hub for illicit money laundering.” The indictment claims that KuCoin received over $5 billion and sent over $4 billion of suspicious and criminal funds.</p>
<p>The investigation further claims that KuCoin, founded in September 2017 by Chun Gan and Ke Tang, actively solicited business from US customers through its spot and futures trading platforms.</p>
<p>Despite its growth, with over 30 million customers and significant daily trading volume, the DOJ alleges that KuCoin evaded AML obligations required for money transmitting businesses, including registration with the US Department of Treasury&#8217;s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and the US Commodity and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).</p>
<h2>KuCoin Accused Of Evading AML And KYC Requirements</h2>
<p>The indictment further alleges that KuCoin, Gan, and Tang were aware of their AML obligations but deliberately chose to disregard them. According to the DOJ’s investigations, until July 2023, KuCoin had no customer identification requirements in place, implementing a belated KYC (know-your-customer) program only after being notified of the federal investigation. </p>
<p>However, the prosecution contends that this program applied solely to new customers, leaving millions of existing customers, including a significant number in the United States, unchecked. </p>
<p>The indictment also accuses Gan, Tang, and KuCoin of “actively” concealing the existence of US customers in an attempt to evade AML and KYC requirements. In its announcement, the DOJ claimed that KuCoin prevented its US customers from identifying themselves as such during the account registration process. </p>

<p>If convicted, Gan and Tang, both Chinese citizens, could face a maximum sentence of five years in prison for each count of conspiring to violate the Bank Secrecy Act and conspiring to operate an unlicensed money transmitting business.</p>
<img alt="KuCoin" class="size-large" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/MGDQb7rh/" width="1814" />
<p>As of the current update, the native token of the exchange, KCS, has experienced a substantial impact following the disclosure of the news and the charges brought by the DOJ. At present, the KCS token is trading at $12.76, reflecting a significant decrease of 10% within a mere one-hour timeframe.</p>

<title>Shiba Inu Held On Exchanges Falls To 2-Year Low, What This Means</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-exchanges-2-year-low/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-exchanges-2-year-low/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章指出Shiba Inu加密货币正受到投资者青睐，其交易所持有的数量已大幅减少至两年来的最低水平。此外，SHIB的供应量持续下降，同时在交易所之外的供应量持续增加。交易所流入量也显着减少，表明投资者可能在等待更高的价格再次出售。预测Shiba Inu在本牛市中将表现出色，并有可能超过其历史最高价。 <div>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inus-shibarium-hits-new-record-amid-chaotic-market-movements/">The Shiba Inu (SHIB) ecosystem</a> is gaining traction, as different metrics suggest that investors are more bullish on the meme coin than ever. One of these metrics is the latest development, which shows that the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-outperform-dogecoin/">number of SHIB tokens</a> held on exchanges has drastically reduced. </p>
<h2>Shiba Inu On Exchanges Drops To 2-Year Low</h2>
<p><a href="https://studio.glassnode.com/metrics?a=SHIB&amp;category=Entities&amp;m=distribution.BalanceExchanges&amp;s=1553676596&amp;u=1711356596&amp;zoom=1825" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Data</a> from <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bull-market-glassnode/">crypto analytics firm Glassnode</a> shows that the amount of SHIB held on exchanges has dropped to its lowest level since March 2022. This underscores the bullish sentiment among SHIB investors, as the decline in the meme coin’s supply invariably means that these investors are choosing to hold for the long term rather than offloading their holdings anytime soon. </p>

<p><a href="https://app.santiment.net/charts/iXhlYy3R__sCl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Data</a> from the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/why-these-2-altcoins-could-witness-price-bumps/">on-chain analytics platform Santiment</a> also shows the steady decline in the SHIB supply on exchanges, which currently stands at just over 75 trillion (7% of the token’s circulating supply). At the same time, the supply outside of exchanges has continued to climb, currently standing at over 925 trillion SHIB. </p>
<p>Another metric that signals bullish sentiment for the meme coin is the daily exchange inflow recorded. <a href="https://app.santiment.net/charts/iXhlYy3R__sCl" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Data</a> from Santiment shows that this figure has also significantly reduced. For context, over 3 trillion SHIB was <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-transactions-spree/">moved to exchange wallets</a> on March 1, and on March 22, only about 376 million SHIB was transferred to exchanges. </p>
<p>These figures suggest a drop in the short-term sell pressure as investors might be easing off on taking profits from the meme coin. This creates room for SHIB to enjoy another parabolic price surge since there is the likelihood that the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-whale-dumps-substantial-holdings-on-the-market-heres-how-much/">short-term holders</a> have already exited their positions. </p>
<h2>Shiba Inu To Make A Statement In This Bull Run</h2>
<p>This bullish stance on SHIB isn’t surprising, as the meme coin is projected to be one of the crypto tokens that will stand out in this <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bull-market-glassnode/">bull run</a>. <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-lead-dev-prediction/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Shiba Inu’s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama</a>, also <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-lead-dev-shib-bull/">boldly claimed</a> that SHIB is well-positioned as the leading <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-based-wif-meme-coins/">meme coin</a> in this market cycle. </p>

<p>Investors’ faith in SHIB is <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/dogecoin-shiba-inu-pepe-explode/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">further strengthened</a> by the fact that meme coins look to be one of the leading narratives of this cycle. As such, some of the spotlight will shine on SHIB as the second-largest meme coin by market cap, which could positively reflect its price. </p>
<p>Crypto analysts have also weighed in on SHIB’s future trajectory and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-surge-crypto-shib/#:~:text=Shiba%20Inu%20To%20See%20A%20300%25%20Gain%20Before%20Year%2Dend&amp;text=Looking%20at%20SHIB&#039;s%20chart%2C%20the,invest%20in%20the%20crypto%20token.">predicted</a> that the crypto token will likely surpass its all-time high (ATH) of $0.00008845 in this bull market. Although ambitious, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-analyst-predicts-1300-for-cardano/">crypto analyst Ali Martinez</a> <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/122000-surge-shiba-inu-price/">predicted</a> that SHIB could rise to as high as $0.011 at some point. </p>

<title>Bitcoin Whale Profits Soar To $16.3 Billion Despite Mixed Spot BTC ETF Flows</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-whale-profits-mixed-spot-btc-etf-flows/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-whale-profits-mixed-spot-btc-etf-flows/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。CryptoQuant创始人Ki Young Ju指出，历史性的流入对短期鲸鱼交易者，包括现货比特币交易所交易基金（ETF）买家的盈利能力至关重要。比特币价格在周末快速上涨至70000美元以上。现货比特币ETF继续影响比特币价格走势，总资产管理规模已达到600亿美元。虽然过去一周出现了五个连续的资金外流日，但在Fidelity的FBTC带领下，资金流入也有所回升。未来的资金流入是否会加速，价格是否会回升仍有待观察。 <div>
<p>Ki Young Ju, the founder of CryptoQuant, a crypto analytics platform, now <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/ki_young_ju/status/1772576789430165966" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">says</a> historic inflow into Bitcoin is the key driver of profitability among short-term whales, including spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) buyers. </p>
<p>Referencing on-chain data, the founder notes that these investors have amassed roughly $16.3 billion in unrealized profit, translating to a gain of about 16%. </p>

<h2>BTC Snaps Back Bullish After Correcting Lower</h2>
<p>The revelation comes roughly a day after the world&#8217;s most valuable coin broke back above $70,000, extending gains over the weekend. After a series of lower lows threatened to wipe out gains, the coin rose sharply over the weekend, breaking above the $69,000 resistance level.</p>

<p>When writing on March 16, BTC is trading above the middle BB, a dynamic price level chartists use to mark out resistance or support, depending on the trend. The extension on March 25 might also spur more demand, lifting the coin above $73,800 and to new territory.</p>
<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/x/2IegTaI3/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Bitcoin price trending upward on the daily chart | Source: BTCUSDT on Binance, TradingView" class="size-full" height="904" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/2IegTaI3/" width="1787" /></a>
<p>Spot Bitcoin ETFs continue to shape the coin&#8217;s price action. Even before approval in mid-January 2024, rumors of its green lighting by the strict United States Securities and Exchange Commission (<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-ceo-predicts-sec-setback-in-ethereum-case/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">SEC</a>) lifted prices. </p>
<p>The coin rallied above $40,000, reaching highs of around $47,200 on January 8. After the approval, prices briefly contracted before rocketing higher, registering new all-time highs in early March 2024.</p>
<p>Interest in spot Bitcoin ETFs has seen its total assets under management (AUM) surge to $60 billion in around ten weeks. It took Gold ETFs approximately 15 years to reach the same milestone. This uptick points to the upswing in demand, possibly from other players and institutions seeking exposure to the asset.</p>
<img alt="Gold versus Bitcoin ETFs AUM | Source: Analyst on X" class="size-full wp-image-289738" height="389" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GJltl5laEAAqmab.jpg?resize=748%2C389" width="748" />
<h2>Eyes On Inflows Into Spot Bitcoin ETFs</h2>
<p>Still, while spot Bitcoin ETFs shape price action, cracks are beginning to emerge. The past week marked the second time in the coin&#8217;s history to record five consecutive days of outflows. Increased outflow coincided with Bitcoin prices edging lower, dropping to as low as $63,500. However, this trend ended on March 25, with Fidelity&#8217;s FBTC leading the rebound. </p>

<p>For now, it remains to be seen whether inflow will pick up pace in the sessions ahead. If more capital flows to spot Bitcoin ETF issuers, reversing last week&#8217;s impact, it is highly likely that prices will also recover. Even so, whether the coin will break above $74,000 ahead of Bitcoin halving is unclear.</p>

<title>UK Embraces Crypto: Bitcoin And Ethereum ETNs Coming To London Stock Exchange</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/uk-embraces-crypto-bitcoin-and-ethereum-etns-coming-to-london-stock-exchange/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/uk-embraces-crypto-bitcoin-and-ethereum-etns-coming-to-london-stock-exchange/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。伦敦证券交易所（LSE）宣布将推出比特币和以太坊交易所交易债券（ETN），以迎接加密市场的增长。该举措标志着LSE意识到机构投资者对加密货币的日益关注，并旨在成为数字资产受监管交易的关键参与者。ETN上市将允许投资者安全地获得比特币和以太坊的表现，而不必直接购买和持有这些数字资产。这一举措将在2024年5月28日推出，初期参与将仅限于专业投资者。 <div>
<p>The London Stock Exchange (LSE), facing declining listings and trading activity, is making a strategic move to embrace the booming crypto market. In a notice released today, the LSE announced the<a href="https://docs.londonstockexchange.com/sites/default/files/documents/n0324.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> launch of a brand new market</a> dedicated to Bitcoin and Ethereum exchange-traded notes (ETNs), set to debut on May 28th, 2024.</p>

<p>This initiative marks a significant shift for the LSE, traditionally known for housing established blue-chip stocks. It signifies a recognition of the growing institutional investor interest in cryptocurrencies, and the LSE&#8217;s intent to become a key player in the regulated trading of digital assets.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-289640" height="196" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_db1492.png?resize=693%2C196" width="693" /></p>
<h2><strong>Opening The Doors For Crypto Exposure</strong></h2>
<p>The new market will allow companies to list ETNs that track the performance of <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bitcoin and Ethereum</a>, two of the leading cryptocurrencies. This provides investors with a regulated and secure way to gain exposure to these digital assets without directly buying and holding them.</p>
<p>Applications for listing these ETNs will open on April 8th, giving issuers enough time to meet the LSE&#8217;s requirements and obtain approval from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) for their prospectuses.</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s important to note that participation in this initial launch will be restricted to &#8220;professional investors&#8221; only. This category encompasses authorized credit institutions and investment firms, essentially excluding retail investors from accessing these ETNs at the outset.</p>
<p>This may raise questions about inclusivity, but the LSE&#8217;s focus on establishing a robust regulatory framework for crypto trading could pave the way for broader participation in the future.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/izpHIjWo/" width="1835" /></p>

<h2><strong>A Calculated Move Amidst Challenges</strong></h2>
<p>The LSE&#8217;s foray into crypto comes at a time when the exchange is grappling with several challenges. According to a recent Bloomberg report, the number of companies listing on the LSE has witnessed a dramatic decline, with 2023 recording the lowest number of IPOs since 2009.</p>
<p>Trading activity has also shrunk significantly compared to pre-crisis levels. This decline can be attributed to factors like shifting investor preferences, competition from other exchanges, and an evolving regulatory landscape.</p>
<p>The digital asset market, with its burgeoning institutional investor base, presents a unique opportunity for the LSE to revitalize its position. By creating a secure and well-regulated environment for crypto trading, the LSE can attract investments and potentially help the UK maintain its edge in the global digital asset economy.</p>

<strong>Unveiling The Nuances: ETNs Vs ETFs</strong>
<p>While both ETNs and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) offer exposure to underlying assets, there are key differences in their structures. ETFs function like baskets of stocks or other holdings that investors partially own.</p>
<p>In contrast, ETNs are more akin to unsecured debt notes issued by a bank. The bank uses the proceeds from these notes to invest in assets that track a specific index, like Bitcoin or Ethereum in this case. The value of the ETN reflects the performance of those underlying assets.</p>
<p>Essentially, when you buy an ETF share, you&#8217;re acquiring a portion of the actual assets it holds. With an ETN, you&#8217;re essentially loaning money to the bank in exchange for a note that promises a return based on the performance of the underlying index it tracks.</p>
<strong>The Road Ahead: A Cautious Optimism</strong>
<p>The LSE&#8217;s crypto ETN launch is a positive development for the UK&#8217;s digital asset ambitions. It demonstrates the LSE&#8217;s willingness to adapt to evolving market trends and cater to growing investor interest.</p>
<p>However, the initial exclusion of retail investors and the success of the new market in attracting issuers and investors will be crucial factors to watch. With a well-defined regulatory framework and a focus on inclusivity, the LSE&#8217;s crypto initiative could be a game-changer, propelling it back to the forefront of global financial hubs.</p>

<title>Here’s How A Crypto Trader Made $1.6 Million In One Hour Trading Meme Coins</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-1-6-million-bsc-meme-coin/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章介绍了一位加密交易员在BSC网络上交易一种迷因币而赚取了160万美元的案例。该交易员投入了6000个BNB购买PUMP币，随着PUMP币价格上涨，最终卖出获利160万美元。此外，文章还提到了其他迷因币在市场上表现出色的情况，如PEPE币和BOME币等，展示了人们对迷因币的日益增长的兴趣。整体来看，迷因币在加密市场上取得了显著的增长和成功。 <div>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/top-ai-meme-coins/">Meme coin trading</a> has been heating up across a number of networks and a lot of crypto traders have become richer for it. Mainly, Solana <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-investing-meme-coins/">meme coins continue to dominate</a>, but other networks such as the BSC network is beginning to see an uptick in interest. One crypto trader in particular made $1.6 million in one hour trading a meme coin on the BSC network. Here’s how they did it.</p>
<h2>Crypto Trader Makes $1.6 Million With BSC-Based Meme Coin</h2>
<p class="p1">Large meme coin launches have been happening over the last month, with multiple memes running to tens of millions of dollars in a matter of days. This was no different in the case of the Big Pump (PUMP) token which launched on the BSC blockchain on March 25.</p>

<p class="p1">Taking advantage of the hype surrounding the token launch, a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bnb-whales-dump-millions-of-busd/">BNB whale</a> used 6,000 BNB to buy into PUMP. At the time of the buy, the 6,000 BNB was worth $3.48 million, and the crypto trader received 375.4 billion PUMP tokens in return.</p>
<p class="p1">As the price of the PUMP coin grew over the next hour, so did the whale’s holdings, eventually crossing $5 million. According to data from Lookonchain, the crypto trader proceeded to sell 360.4 billion PUMP tokens across a number of transactions for a total of $5.08 million. Taking out their initial capital, the trader realized a $1.6 million profit from this single sale.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">After <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24PUMP&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">$PUMP</a> opened trading, a whale made 2,759 <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BNB&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">$BNB</a>($1.6M) on <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24PUMP&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">$PUMP</a> in less than 1 hour!</p>

<p></p>
<p class="p1">The crypto trader had initially left a balance of 15 billion PUMP tokens, as Lookonchain data shows. However, they proceeded to offload another 5 billion tokens, leaving their current balance at the time of this writing at 10 billion. This <a href="https://bscscan.com/token/0x22b4fa9a13a0d303ad258ee6d62a6ac60364b0c9?a=0x3dca07e16b2becd3eb76a9f9ce240b525451f887" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">balance</a> is worth $122,624 at PUMP’s current trading price of $0.00001224.</p>
<h2 class="p1">Meme Coins Lead Market Gains</h2>
<p class="p1"><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-investing-meme-coins/">Meme coins have been the leaders of this bull cycle</a> so far with impressive run from a number of crypto coins that fall in this category. The PEPE coin had revived the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/top-ai-meme-coins/">meme coin movement</a>, and then it was propelled further by the likes of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-meme-coins-myro-wif/">Solana-based BONK and WIF</a> which have all crossed the billion-dollar mark in the space of a year.</p>

<p class="p1">As the market heads further into the bull cycle, there have been other meme coins that have turned heads during this time. One of these meme coins is Book of Meme (BOME), a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-based-wif-meme-coins/">meme coin</a> which got a Binance listing and crossed the $1 billion market cap mark all within a day.</p>
<p class="p1">Others have followed this trajectory as the likes of SLERF also ran to over $200 million in one day. The BSC-based PUMP token also crossed a $50 million market cap on its first day, signaling a growing interest in meme coins no matter the blockchain.</p>

<title>Do Kwon And Terra Vs. SEC: Day 1 Is Off To A Hot Start</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/do-kwon-terra-vs-sec-day-1/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/do-kwon-terra-vs-sec-day-1/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章讨论了Terraform Labs和其创始人Do Kwon与美国证券交易委员会（SEC）之间的审判。审判在曼哈顿开始，由九名陪审团成员听取双方的开场陈述。SEC指控Terraform Labs欺诈，并称TerraUSD稳定性问题是欺诈行为。辩护方则强调失败与欺诈意图之间的区别，并将展示Terra的区块链技术在Chai应用程序中的实际使用。审判仍在进行中，双方预计将提供详细证据和专家证词支持其立场。 <div>
<p>The much-anticipated civil <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/terraform-labs-in-the-hot-seat-trial-begins/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">trial</a> between Terraform Labs, its embattled founder Do Kwon, and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began on Monday in Manhattan, marking a pivotal moment in the ongoing scrutiny of the crypto space and regulatory oversight.</p>
<h2>Do Kwon / Terra Trial: Day 1</h2>
<p>Zack Guzmán, the award-winning Web3 host and founder of Coinage Media, was live on site and provided a summary from the courthouse via X, noting a stark contrast in attendance compared to the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-to-gangster-sbf-photo-in-jail-comes-to-light/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) trial.</a> Despite the lesser crowd, the significance of the trial was palpable, with both parties presenting their opening arguments before a carefully selected jury of nine – a process that included its share of courtroom levity, particularly from US District Judge Jed Rakoff.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">NEW: Do Kwon / Terra vs. SEC off to a hot start in Manhattan court today</p>
<p>We already got a jury selected along with opening statements from both the SEC and defense teams (plus’s some pretty hilarious material from Judge Rakoff) </p>
<p>Here’s everything from Day 1 <img alt="🧵" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f9f5.png" style="height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/vl74lUgFZs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/vl74lUgFZs</a></p>

<p></p>
<p>Guzmán remarked, “Eventually landed on a jury of just 3 men and 6 women &#8211; mostly minorities. Of the three men, one is divorced, [&#8230;] The divorcee is rocking a New York Giants jacket. Judge Rakoff jokes that he is also a Giants fan… “That’s why I’m wearing black, because I am in mourning.”</p>
<p>Related Reading: <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/terraform-labs-in-the-hot-seat-trial-begins/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Terraform Labs In The Hot Seat: Trial Begins As Do Kwon’s Final Extradition Decision Looms</a></p>
<p>Besides that, Judge Rakoff and the opening statements set the tone for what promises to be an intense legal confrontation. Rakoff laid out ground rules from the jump: &#8220;Trial expected to take 2 weeks. Only 4-word objections allowed. The only way you can get me mad is a speedy objection. You say 3 words: ‘Objection, lack of foundation&#8217;.”</p>
<p>The SEC&#8217;s opening salvo framed the case as a clear instance of fraud, drawing parallels to arguments used in the recent trial against Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX. Central to the SEC&#8217;s accusations are claims that Terraform Labs misrepresented the use of its blockchain in the Chai mobile payment app and misled investors about the stability of its <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/terraform-labs-files-for-bankruptcy-in-the-us/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">TerraUSD stablecoin</a>, which was designed to maintain a peg to the dollar.</p>
<p>Attorney Devon Staren presented a concise yet potent argument: &#8220;Terra was a fraud, a house of cards, and when it collapsed, investors lost nearly everything.&#8221; On the other side, Terraform&#8217;s defense, articulated by David Patton, pivoted on a critical distinction between failure and fraudulent intent.</p>

<p>Patton&#8217;s assertion, &#8220;Failure doesn’t equal fraud,&#8221; seeks to challenge the SEC&#8217;s narrative by suggesting that the collapse of TerraUSD was a consequence of market volatility rather than deceptive practices by Terraform Labs and Do Kwon.</p>
<p>The SEC&#8217;s case hinges on two main allegations: that Terraform Labs and Do Kwon misrepresented the stability and functionality of TerraUSD and that it falsely claimed its blockchain was utilized in the Chai payment app. These claims are not just about investor losses but also about trust in the blockchain ecosystem and the integrity of its architects.</p>
<p>Terraform&#8217;s defense strategy involves not only refuting these allegations but also highlighting the innovative nature of their work in the cryptocurrency space. The defense hints at forthcoming evidence that will demonstrate the actual usage of Terra&#8217;s blockchain technology in the Chai app, countering the SEC&#8217;s claims of misinformation.</p>
<p>As the trial against Do Kwon progresses, both parties are expected to present detailed evidence and expert testimonies to support their arguments. The SEC will likely delve deeper into the technical and financial mechanisms that led to TerraUSD&#8217;s instability, while Terraform&#8217;s defense will aim to contextualize the challenges and uncertainties inherent in pioneering new financial technologies.</p>
<p>At press time, Terra Luna Classic (LUNC) traded at $0.000169259.</p>
<img alt="Terra Luna Classic price" class="size-full wp-image-289665" height="472" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/LUNCUSD_2024-03-26_10-12-11.png?resize=1024%2C472" width="1024" />

<title>Ethereum Spot ETF Mirrors Bitcoin’s Trailblazing Strength: Grayscale CLO</title>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的<br />格瑞斯卡莱首席法律官克雷格·萨尔姆对以太坊现货交易所交易基金（ETF）的未来充满信心，认为与比特币现货ETF相似，以太坊现货ETF的通过案例同样强有力。他强调美国证监会与申请人互动的积极性，指出与比特币ETF类似，以太坊ETF的流程基本相同。萨尔姆还强调了现货与期货之间的强关联性，并支持以太坊ETF的批准。格瑞斯卡莱公司期待与监管机构讨论这些重要产品。虽然目前以太坊交易产品的批准几率有所下降，但仍显示出积极信心。 <div>
<p>Amid uncertainty around Ethereum Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), Grayscale Chief Legal Officer (CLO) Craig Salm has <a href="https://x.com/CraigSalm/status/1772360837094691302?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">expressed</a> his insights on the subject, addressing the similarities between Ethereum and Bitcoin spot ETFs.</p>
<h2>Ethereum Spot ETFs Is Just As Strong As Bitcoin Spot ETFs</h2>
<p>Craig Salm appears optimistic about the Ethereum spot ETFs&#8217; approval from the United States <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/a16z-crypto-lawyer-us-sec-spot-ethereum-etfs/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</a>, as he believes &#8220;the case for the products is just as strong as it was for Bitcoin ETFs.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Grayscale&#8217;s CLO underscored his unwavering confidence in the products&#8217; approval, despite ongoing negative speculations within the crypto landscape. However, his main goal is to shed light on how the SEC&#8217;s engagement with applicants in the situation is perceived.</p>

<p>Addressing the Commission&#8217;s engagement, Salm drew the community&#8217;s attention to the final months before <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-btc-etf-approved-ethereum-eth-next/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin ETFs</a> were approved, noting that during this period, the SEC engaged with Grayscale and several other issuers positively and contructively.</p>
<p>In addition, there were thoughtful discussions about the specifics of creation/redemption processes, cash vs. in-kind, APs, LPs, custody, and among others. Drawing a parallel between Ethereum and Bitcoin ETFs, Salm stated that the process is identical, suggesting a potential approval.</p>
<p>According to him, the only aspect that proves to be different is that the ETF holds <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-price-reach-14000/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">ETH</a> instead of BTC. Thus, issuers essentially have less to interact with at this time because the regulatory watchdog has already engaged in numerous ways.</p>
<p>Due to this, Salm is optimistic despite the uncertainty surrounding the final approval dates, arguing that results should not be determined by what is perceived as a lack of regulatory engagement.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the CLO highlighted his complete alignment with crypto figures such as Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal and Brian Quintenz&#8217;s opinions regarding the necessity of approving Ethereum spot ETFs.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that Paul Grawel previously contested the SEC&#8217;s stance, claiming that the regulatory agency lacked sufficient evidence to categorize Ethereum as a security or legitimate grounds for rejecting ETH exchange-traded products.</p>
<h2>Strong Correlation Between Futures And Spot</h2>
<p>While resonating with opinions from the aforementioned figures, Salm supports the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/approval-denial-ethereum-etf-sell-the-news-event/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">approval of ETH ETFs</a> because they should be considered commodity futures and consistent with ETH futures ETFs. This is due to his belief that there is a strong connection between futures and spots.</p>

<p>Finally, Salm asserts that investors want and deserve to be exposed to ETH through ETFs, while underlining Grayscale&#8217;s belief that the case for spot Ethereum ETFs reflects similar strength as spot Bitcoin ETFs, reiterating the firm&#8217;s support for approval. In the meantime, the company anticipates discussing these significant products with the agency.</p>
<p>So far, the approval odds for the ETH exchange products have witnessed a substantial decline over time. <a href="https://polymarket.com/event/ethereum-etf-approved-by-may-31?tid=1711444026959" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Data</a> from Polymarket reveals that the odds are presently down to around 27%.</p>

<title>BlackRock Bitcoin ETF Beats OKX And Kraken Holdings Combined</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-beats-okx-and-kraken-holdings/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-beats-okx-and-kraken-holdings/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章介绍了世界上最大的资产管理公司BlackRock通过其iShares比特币信托（IBIT）在比特币所有权方面的主导地位，已超过许多传统交易所和主要公司投资者。IBIT的快速增长被归因于机构投资者对比特币作为一种可行资产类别的信心增强。它还指出BlackRock的ETF可能在未来几周内超过Grayscale的比特币信托（GBTC）在比特币持有方面的地位。这标志着比特币市场的新时代，为进一步的机构投资铺平了道路。 <div>
<p>In a move signaling a major shift in the cryptocurrency landscape, BlackRock, the world&#8217;s largest asset manager, has emerged as a dominant force in Bitcoin ownership through its iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT). Launched in mid-January 2024, IBIT has rapidly accumulated Bitcoin (BTC) holdings, surpassing not only established crypto exchanges but also major corporate investors.</p>

<p>Financial analysts are attributing this rapid growth to a surge in institutional investor confidence in Bitcoin as a viable asset class. Traditionally, investing in cryptocurrency has been a complex process for institutional investors, often involving navigating unregulated exchanges and securing private wallets.</p>
<h2><strong>BlackRock Edges OKX, Kraken In Bitcoin ETF Investments</strong></h2>
<p>ETFs, like IBIT, offer a more familiar and regulated framework, similar to investing in stocks or bonds. This accessibility is seen as a key driver behind the massive inflows into IBIT, which currently boasts over 243,130 BTC, according to crypto analyst Ali.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">BlackRock’s <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">#Bitcoin</a> ETF launched in mid-January 2024 and now it holds more <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BTC&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">$BTC</a> than OKX and Kraken combined, which launched in 2017 and 2011, respectively. <a href="https://t.co/3cVtdaYa55" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/3cVtdaYa55</a></p>
<p>— Ali (@ali_charts) <a href="https://twitter.com/ali_charts/status/1772017123927207977?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">March 24, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>This figure eclipses the combined holdings of prominent crypto exchanges OKX (132,500 BTC) and Kraken (77,300 BTC), both of which have been operational for significantly longer. The shift suggests a potential power move, with traditional financial institutions like BlackRock taking the reins from crypto-native exchanges in managing Bitcoin assets.</p>
<p>BlackRock&#8217;s dominance extends beyond exchanges. IBIT&#8217;s holdings even surpass those of MicroStrategy, a well-known corporate advocate for Bitcoin, which currently holds an estimated 214,246 BTC. This unexpected development highlights the growing institutional appetite for Bitcoin and the potential for IBIT to influence the overall market.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/mtYAD08D/" width="2475" /></p>

<p>Analysts like Ali point to a possible correlation between IBIT&#8217;s growth and rising Bitcoin prices. The recent surge in Bitcoin&#8217;s value, currently hovering around $66,948, could be fueled in part by the increasing demand for IBIT. Additionally, Ali suggests that a sustained break above $66,990 could trigger a further rise towards $72,880.</p>
<h2><strong>BlackRock&#8217;s ETF Could Surpass GBTC In Bitcoin Holdings</strong></h2>
<p>IBIT&#8217;s rapid growth also poses a challenge to Grayscale&#8217;s Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the long-standing leader in Bitcoin ETFs. With average daily inflows of $274 million and an estimated 4,120 new Bitcoin entering IBIT every day, it&#8217;s projected to surpass GBTC&#8217;s holdings within the next three weeks. GBTC, conversely, has experienced outflows exceeding $277 million over the past two weeks.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-289650" height="682" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_44f8fb.png?resize=642%2C682" width="642" /></p>

<p>While the future trajectory of Bitcoin prices remains speculative, BlackRock&#8217;s involvement undoubtedly signifies a new era for the cryptocurrency.</p>

<p>The world&#8217;s largest asset manager&#8217;s commitment to Bitcoin through IBIT lends legitimacy to the asset class and paves the way for further institutional investment. With its growing influence, BlackRock is poised to become a major player in shaping the future of Bitcoin and the broader cryptocurrency market.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Bonanza: Peruvian Gold Miner Intends To Buy $1.7 Billion</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-peruvian-gold-miner-1-7-billion/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。周一，秘鲁金矿商Nilam Resources, Inc.宣布拟收购24,800比特币，为公司的多元化和创新奠定了基础。该交易将通过发行新授权的优先级C系列股票进行，以超过10亿美元的数字资产作为抵押提高资本。有关交易条款和战略细节将在后续确定性协议中澄清，这将是Nilam Resources在公共金融市场中的重要未来里程碑。此举受到比特币社区的怀疑和谨慎态度，尤其是一些知名人士提出了质疑。 <div>
<p>On Monday, Peruvian gold miner Nilam Resources, Inc. (OTC PINK: NILA) has <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2024/03/25/2851986/0/en/Nilam-Resources-Enters-Letters-of-Intent-to-Acquire-24-800-Bitcoin.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> its intention to acquire a staggering 24,800 Bitcoin (BTC). The strategic initiative comes via a Letter of Intent (LOI) with Xyberdata Ltd, setting the stage for the acquisition of 100% of the common stock of MindWave, a special purpose entity to be established in Mauritius for holding the digital assets.</p>
<h2>Following The Saylor Playbook</h2>
<p>This significant shift towards digital asset investment by Nilam Resources involves the issuance of a newly authorized Preferred Class of Series C Stock, offered in exchange for the Bitcoin at a discount relative to current market prices. With the transaction, Nilam aims to secure digital assets exceeding one billion dollars in value, underpinning a broad strategic milestone for the company in its pursuit of diversification and innovation.</p>
<p>Pranjali More, CEO of Nilam Resources, Inc., underscored the strategic importance of the transaction, stating, &#8220;The Company and team have been working diligently over the last several months to finalize all agreements and due diligence necessary to proceed to a legally binding Letter of Intent (LOI).&#8221;</p>

<p>The collaboration with Xyberdata and the establishment of MindWave in Mauritius is part of Nilam&#8217;s strategic vision to harness the potential of Bitcoin. These assets will serve not only as a significant addition to the company&#8217;s portfolio but also as collateral to raise capital for investment in high-yield generating projects.</p>
<p>This move aligns with NILA&#8217;s broader objectives of fostering a finance ecosystem that is inclusive, sustainable, and defined by transparency, innovation, and sustainability. &#8220;We prioritize clear communication, embrace cutting-edge ideas, and invest in projects with enduring social and environmental impact,&#8221; added Pranjali More.</p>
<p>The acquisition terms and further strategic details are anticipated to be laid out in subsequent definitive agreements. The completion of this acquisition will see MindWave becoming a fully owned subsidiary of Nilam Resources, with MindWave shareholders exchanging their equity interest for the newly issued Preferred Stock (Class C).</p>
<p>This class of stock will entail conversion rights upon a listing on NASDAQ or another national exchange, among other liquidity events, signaling a significant future milestone for Nilam Resources in the public financial markets.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Community Reacts With Doubts</h2>
<p>However, the announcement has been met with skepticism and caution by several notable figures within the Bitcoin community. Matthew Sigel, Head of digital assets research at <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etf-by-vaneck-benefit-btc-core-developers/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">VanEck</a>, hinted at Nilam&#8217;s strategic inspiration, <a href="https://twitter.com/hodlonaut/status/1772363033219678419" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">stating</a>, &#8220;IN SAYLOR HE TRUSTS &#8211;&gt;MOGO, $50M market cap payments company, which owns 13% stake in crypto exchange WonderFi (WNDR CN, mkt cap $180M) announces plans to add Bitcoin to company treasury.&#8221;</p>
<p>Tuur Demeester, a respected Bitcoin OG and analyst for Adamant Research, <a href="https://twitter.com/TuurDemeester/status/1772363440729800984" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">expressed</a> his reservations more bluntly: &#8220;I removed my tweet about that gold explorer buying 24k BTC, after a commenter pointed out that it&#8217;s indeed a stunt from a dying penny stock (market cap of $5M). Perhaps it&#8217;s a harbinger of what will come, but this, indeed, is _not_ huge news.&#8221;</p>

<p>This sentiment reflects a broader skepticism about the motivations behind Nilam&#8217;s <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/microstrategy-1-of-all-bitcoin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">pivot to Bitcoin</a>, questioning the solidity of the company&#8217;s financial strategy.</p>
<p>Criticism also came from @hodlonaut, who <a href="https://twitter.com/hodlonaut/status/1772363033219678419" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">voiced</a> concerns about the nature of the transaction and the methods Nilam might employ to secure the funds for such a significant purchase, stating, &#8220;Not sure what type of fiat abomination NILAM is, or what type of accounting voodoo they intend to deploy to raise the funds, but I do know they want 24,800 btc and that there will never be more than 21M. A <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-halving-and-spot-etfs-the-impending-btc-supply-shock/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">storm is brewing</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bitcoin analyst Dyan LeClair <a href="https://twitter.com/DylanLeClair_/status/1772366591495135537" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">added</a> that MOGO is a microcap OTC stock, &#8220;so this can only work if there is demand for the equity sale. A letter of intent is one thing, actually executing is another. Likely flops, and is for PR purposes. On the contrary, we live in meme world, who knows what happens.&#8221;</p>
<p>At press time, BTC traded at $70,316.</p>

<title>FTX Set To Cash In $884 Million From Majority Stake Sale In Anthropic</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-set-to-cash-in-884-million-from-sale-anthropic/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-set-to-cash-in-884-million-from-sale-anthropic/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />FTX加密交易所将以8.84亿美元的价格出售其在人工智能初创公司Anthropic中的三分之二股权，以偿还债务并增加现金储备。该交易涉及包括阿联酋穆巴达拉（Mubadala）、Jane Street、Fidelity Management and Research以及风险投资公司HOF Capital在内的买家。交易所投资5亿美元于Anthropic，并在破产面临指控后于2021年拥有8%的股权。销售此股权预计将有助于FTX偿还债务，并巩固其财务地位。 <div>
<p>Bankrupt crypto exchange FTX will sell two-thirds of its stake in artificial intelligence (AI) startup Anthropic for $884 million, according to a Bloomberg <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/ftx-to-sell-majority-of-anthropic-stake-for-884-million" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>. The move comes as FTX seeks to repay its creditors and bolster its cash reserves. </p>
<p>The sale involves various buyers, including ATIC Third International Investment Company LLC, associated with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/uaes-address-unauthorized-digital-asset-usage/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">sovereign wealth fund</a> Mubadala, Jane Street, Fidelity Management and Research, and venture capital firm HOF Capital.</p>
<h2>FTX Approved To Sell Ownership</h2>
<p>In 2021, FTX invested $500 million in Anthropic, a year before facing bankruptcy amidst allegations of fraud. Anthropic, known for its AI research work, attracted significant investments from tech giants <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/amazon-will-invest-4-billion-ftx-backed-ai-startup/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Amazon </a>and Alphabet Inc.&#8217;s Google in 2023, valuing the startup at up to $6 billion.</p>

<p>The FTX bankruptcy estate currently owns an 8% stake in Anthropic, making it one of the estate&#8217;s most valuable assets. As of last month, the estate&#8217;s cash reserves were valued at approximately $6.4 billion. </p>
<p>FTX officials have expressed confidence in repaying all of the company&#8217;s <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sam-bankman-fried-prosecutors-slams-questions-jury/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">creditors</a>, and the sale of the Anthropic stake is expected to significantly contribute to that effort.</p>
<p>As previously <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-creditors-1-billion-crypto/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">reported </a>by Bitcoinist, US bankruptcy Judge John Dorsey approved the decision to sell the Anthropic shares in February. Initially, FTX&#8217;s creditors had reservations about the sale, asserting that FTX had acquired the shares using customer funds. </p>
<p>However, FTX&#8217;s promise to use the sale proceeds to repay its creditors convinced them to approve the proposal. The condition for approval was that the sale proceeds be used to repay the creditors.</p>
<h2>Anthropic Undergoes Ownership Change</h2>
<p>According to Bloomberg, the sale of the majority stake in Anthropic will allow FTX to generate substantial funds, which will be crucial in addressing its financial obligations. </p>
<p>For Anthropic, the sale represents a change in ownership but does not diminish its position as a key artificial intelligence startup. The company&#8217;s previous investments from Amazon and Alphabet Inc.&#8217;s Google have bolstered its position in the rapidly growing field.</p>
<p>Following the sale of the majority of the exchange’s <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/former-ftx-executives-platform-secures-60-million/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">shares </a>in the startup, which company will have the majority of ownership in Antrophic remains to be seen. </p>

<p>FTX&#8217;s decision to sell its majority stake in Anthropic for $884 million is an important step in the bankruptcy reorganization process. By selling its stake, FTX aims to fully repay its creditors and strengthen its financial position. The sale also demonstrates the increased interest in <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/worldcoin-up-46-in-wake-of-altman-board-reunion/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">AI-related startups</a> that has significantly increased the exchange&#8217;s initial $500 million investment. </p>
<img alt="FTX" class="size-large" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/kAtuBUuU/" width="1815" />
<p>As of the current update, the native token of the exchange, FTT, is trading at $2.22, showing a 9% rebound in the last 24 hours. This follows its notable year-to-date surge of 74%. </p>

<title>Crypto Houdini? Binance Exec Escapes From Nigerian Custody Amid Tax Evasion Charges – Report</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。Binance交易所的两名高管之一在尼日利亚当局提出刑事指控后逃离，并于3月22日逃离了尼日利亚。尼日利亚政府控告Binance逃税，并对逃跑的高管提出国际逮捕令。同时，Binance还面临未缴纳增值税、公司所得税等多项指控，政府对其也提起诉讼。 <div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">One of the two senior executives from crypto exchange Binance has escaped from the Nigerian authorities as criminal charges were pressed against him. The executive was <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/nigeria-detains-binances-crypto-crime-investigator/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">first detained</a> on February 26 as part of Nigeria’s actions against the exchange.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">According to local reports, Nigeria’s Federal Government filed Tax evasion charges against Binance amid the escapist turmoil.</p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">From Binance Executive To Crypto Escapist</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A Nigerian newspaper <a href="https://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/680511-exclusive-detained-binance-executive-escapes-from-custody-in-nigeria.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">revealed</a> that Nadeem Anjarwalla, one of the two detained Binance executives, escaped from the government’s custody almost a month after his detention. According to the report, the executive fled the country on March 22.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">After the detention, Anjarwalla remained in custody at an Abuja guest house with Tigran Gambaryan, who was also detained. On Friday, guards on duty took the now-fugitive to a nearby mosque “for prayer in the spirit of the ongoing Ramadan fast.” However, Anjarwalla escaped and allegedly flew out of Abuja on a Middle East Airline.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The logistics for the escape have raised plenty of questions for authorities. The executive, who holds dual British and Kenyan citizenship, had his passport confiscated during the detention.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The investigation has unveiled that the fugitive fled the country with his Kenyan passport. Nonetheless, how he got access to this passport remains a mystery to authorities as he only carried his British travel document when detained in February.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Sources told the local news publication that the guest house where the Binance executives were held was “comfortable” and “allowed many rights.” The phone privileges are now believed to have been exploited by Anjarwalla to plot his escape.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Authorities are working on discovering the fugitive&#8217;s intended destination to get him back into custody. Moreover, the country’s authorities are allegedly in talks with Interpol to issue an international arrest warrant.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">A Binance representative <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/25/binance-executive-escapes-nigerian-custody-as-authorities-file-new-tax-charges.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">confirmed</a> to CNBC that the exchange is aware of the situation and affirmed that they are collaborating with Nigerian authorities on the matter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We were made aware that Nadeem is no longer in Nigerian custody. Our primary focus remains on the safety of our employees and we are working collaboratively with Nigerian authorities to quickly resolve this issue.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Binance Faces Tax Evasion Charges In Nigeria</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As reported by Bitcoinist, Nigeria’s <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/nigeria-fines-binance-10-billion/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">crackdown</a> on Binance saw the crypto exchange fined $10 billion earlier this month, alleging that the platform was responsible for the devaluation of the Nigerian naira.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Subsequently, the government sent a request to the exchange’s CEO, Richard Teng. The ultimatum demanded Teng to address the allegations of “terrorist financing, money laundering, and tax evasion” in the country.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The most recent reports <a href="https://punchng.com/fg-files-tax-evasion-charges-against-binance/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">show</a> that the Nigerian government filed tax evasion charges against the crypto exchange as the shocking news of Anjarwalla&#8217;s escape hit the world.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The four charges were filed at the Federal High Court in Abuja by the Federal Inland Revenue Service. Besides Binance, Anjarwalla and Gambaryan appear as the second and third defendants against the accusations.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Per the local report, the charges levied against the exchange include “non-payment of Value-Added Tax, Company Income Tax, failure to file tax returns, and complicity in aiding customers to evade taxes through its platform.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The Nigerian federal government also accused the crypto exchange of failing to register with the Federal Inland Revenue Service (FIRS) for tax purposes and “contravening existing tax regulations within the country.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In November 2023, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binances-4-3b-settlement-marks-crucial-shift/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Binance</a> pleaded guilty to charges relating to anti-money laundering in the US. This resulted in a $4.3 billion settlement with authorities, including Changpeng Zhao, stepping down as the crypto exchange’s CEO.</p>

<title>SEC Declares Binance A ‘Threat’, Imposes Access Restrictions On Philippine Users</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/binance-users-philippines-face-access-restriction/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。菲律宾证券交易委员会（SEC）阻止当地访问币安，世界上交易量最大的加密货币交易所。SEC指出，币安未获得所需许可证，并未获得批准作为投资和交易平台运营。SEC已要求国家电信委员会（NTC）协助封锁币安的网站和相关页面。此外，币安收购的交易所CommEX已宣布关闭。交易所将逐步停止注册新用户以及其他服务，最终于2024年5月10日关闭官方网站。 <div>
<p>The Philippines Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has taken a significant regulatory step by blocking local access to Binance, the world&#8217;s largest <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-surging-beyond-80000-driven-by-etf-inflows/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">cryptocurrency exchange</a> by trading volume. </p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.sec.gov.ph/pr-2024/sec-proceeds-with-blocking-of-binance/#gsc.tab=0" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">release </a>issued by the regulator on Monday, the SEC&#8217;s decision was based on Binance&#8217;s failure to obtain the necessary license from the commission to operate as an investment and trading platform. </p>
<h2>Binance&#8217;s Website And Services Blocked </h2>
<p>In its March 12 meeting, the SEC approved filing a formal request with the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) to assist in blocking Binance&#8217;s website and related web pages. </p>

<p>The SEC said Binance was offering investment and trading services without the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-implements-stricter-token-listing-procedure/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">required license</a> and allegedly posed a &#8220;threat&#8221; to the safety of Filipino investors&#8217; funds. SEC Chairman Emilio Aquino emphasized the importance of protecting the interests of investors in the request sent to the NTC. Aquino states:</p>
<blockquote><p>The SEC has identified the aforementioned platform and concluded that the public’s continued access to these websites/apps poses a threat to the security of the funds of investing  Filipinos.</p></blockquote>
<p>With an average <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-investigates-300m-bome-token-pre-listing/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">daily trading volume</a> of $65 billion and support for over 402 cryptocurrencies, Binance has gained a substantial user base of more than 183 million members in the Asian country, according to the regulator.</p>
<p>However, the SEC emphasized that Binance has not obtained the necessary license to solicit investments from the public or operate a securities exchange. Consequently, the SEC issued a public warning against investing in or using Binance&#8217;s services. </p>
<p>The commission has been actively exploring the possibility of blocking Binance&#8217;s website and online presence in the Philippines since November 2023. However, due to the “sizable operations” of Binance, the SEC has allowed sufficient time for investors to transition their portfolios toward authorized investment products and platforms.</p>
<h2>CommEX To Close Operations Following Binance Acquisition</h2>
<p>CommEX, the exchange that acquired Binance&#8217;s Russia business in September, has announced its decision to shut down. As per the company&#8217;s <a href="https://commex.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/9278429425807-CommEX-Notice-of-Operation-Suspension" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">statement </a>on its website, the delisting process will commence on May 10, rendering users unable to access any content associated with the exchange. However, a series of steps will be implemented, leading to the closure.</p>
<p>Effective March 25, 2024, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-russian-exodus-did-key-players-shift-commex/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">CommEX </a>will stop new user registrations, asset transfers from Binance, and fiat and cryptocurrency deposit services. Then, on March 28, the exchange will stop opening positions for simple futures and futures trading and only allow users to close existing positions.</p>

<p>More changes will follow: Starting April 2, 2024, P2P services will prohibit merchants from creating new advertisements and prevent users from creating new orders; the system will automatically close existing P2P orders and advertising services.</p>
<p>Trading pairs for Simple Futures and Futures Trading will be delisted on April 18, prompting users to close all open positions to avoid automatic settlements. In addition, the<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/nigeria-detains-binances-crypto-crime-investigator/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> spot market</a> will be closed on April 23rd, automatically canceling all spot orders and disabling the Convert feature.</p>
<p>Finally, on May 10, 2024, the official website of CommEX will be delisted, resulting in the unavailability of any content related to the exchange.</p>

<title>Dogecoin Price Action: Why A 10% Drop Would Cost Traders $66 Million</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-10-drop-66-million/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-10-drop-66-million/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。Dogecoin价格下跌到0.15美元将导致6,600万美元的损失。目前价格维持在0.17美元以上，但如果下跌10%，将有许多交易者亏损。同时，如果价格上涨10%，将有大量做空交易者被清算。一些加密分析师预测Dogecoin价格将继续上涨，交易员对这一加密货币的未来持乐观态度。<br /> <div>
<h2 class="p2">Dogecoin Price Drop To $0.15 Would Wipe Out $66 Million</h2>
<p class="p2">The Dogecoin price is still holding steady above $0.17, but long traders face a threat if the price were to break down and retreat from here. According to <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/pro/futures/LiquidationMap" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">data</a> from Coinglass, there are a lot of traders who would lose money if the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-outperform-dogecoin/">DOGE price</a> were to fall 10% from its current level.</p>

<p class="p2">The liquidation heat map on the website shows that right above the $0.153 level, there is a lot of leveraged longs. A total of 2.43 million <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-outperform-dogecoin/">DOGE</a> in leveraged longs have their liquidation price at this point, and a drop below this price mark would lead to massive liquidations. In total, there are $66.89 million worth of longs at this level, and a 10% drop would trigger this liquidation trend.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Dogecoin liquidation map" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-289440 aligncenter" height="264" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-25-at-13.40.09.png?w=640&#038;resize=640%2C264" width="640" />Source: Coinglass</p>
<p class="p2">On the other end of the spectrum, there are a large number of leveraged shorts that will be liquidated if the price were to rise another 10% from here. Coinglass data shows that the liquidation volumes, if Dogecoin moves above $0.1908, would cross more than $55 million.</p>
<p class="p2">In the shorter term, short traders stand to suffer $20 million in liquidations if the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/big-money-eyes-dogecoin-whale-activity-explodes-600/">DOGE price</a> reaches $0.18. Whole long traders risk a similar amount if the price of the meme coin breaks down below $0.17.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Can DOGE Price Reclaim $0.2?</h2>
<p class="p2">The Dogecoin price continues to get a lot of support, and one of the most recent instances of this is the price surging when the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) announced that it had gotten a number of licenses for its money transmitter business.</p>

<p class="p2">Crypto analysts have also shown bullishness toward the meme coin, expecting the Dogecoin price to continue to rise. One such case is from crypto analyst DonAlt who <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-pundit-predicts-price-surge-for-dogecoin/">believes that the DOGE price could reach a new all-time high with a target at $1</a>.</p>
<p class="p2">DonAlt explains that the meme coin has being trading quite well alongside Bitcoin, so the possibility that it rallies towards $1 is high. The crypto analyst believes that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-surges-x-payments-secures-3-new-licenses/">DOGE</a> is a great investment and it would be a great buy if it does dip to $1 again.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Shatters Profit-Taking Streak From 2021 Bull Run</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-shatters-profit-taking-streak-2021-bull-run/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-shatters-profit-taking-streak-2021-bull-run/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章指出，在最近的比特币牛市中，连续卖出利润的日子已经超过了2021年疯狂涨势中的历史记录。BTC已经连续157天出现净利润带动。通过Net Realized Profit/Loss指标显示，投资者在连续157天内持续取得净利润。此外，BTC价格上涨并突破了69000美元水平。 <div>
<p>On-chain data shows the recent Bitcoin consecutive profit-taking day streak has now surpassed the longest run from the 2021 bull rally.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Has Now Seen 157 Straight Days Of Net Profit-Taking</h2>
<p>As analyst James Van Straten explained as a new <a href="https://twitter.com/jvs_btc/status/1772226408451875076" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, BTC has already surpassed the longest profit-taking spree from the previous bull run during this rally so far.</p>
<p>The relevant indicator here is the &#8220;<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-going-through-one-profit-taking-events-data/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Net Realized Profit/Loss</a>,&#8221; which tracks the net amount of profit or loss (in USD) that Bitcoin investors as a whole are realizing with their selling.</p>

<p>This metric works by going through the on-chain history of each sold coin to see what price it was moved at before this. Assuming that the last transaction of the coin was the last point at which it changed hands, the price at its time would have been its cost basis leading up to its latest sale.</p>
<p>The indicator then subtracts this price from the current spot price at which it&#8217;s being sold/transferred to calculate the realized profit or loss. Naturally, if this difference is positive, the coin&#8217;s sale is contributing to the profit-taking volume, while it being negative implies loss realization.</p>
<p>The Net Realized Profit/Loss sums up all these profits and losses for all the coins being sold at a given moment to output the overall situation in the market.</p>
<p>Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 7-day moving average (MA) of this Bitcoin indicator over the past few years:</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Net Realized Profit/Loss" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="1013" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GJg1wsVWQAEEwoU?format=jpg&amp;name=large" width="1800" /></p>

<p>As displayed in the above graph, the 7-day MA of the Bitcoin Net Realized Profit/Loss has been positive for the past few months. To be more particular, the indicator has held these values for 157 consecutive days now.</p>
<p>When this metric has green values, it means that the market as a whole is participating in a net amount of profit-taking. Similarly, red values imply the dominance of loss-taking.</p>
<p>It would appear that the investors have been taking net profit for 157 straight days now, which is longer than the longest profit-taking streak during the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-volume-79-lower-2021-bull-run-glassnode/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">2021 bull run</a> (155 days).</p>
<p>From the chart, it&#8217;s visible that Bitcoin Net Realized Profit/Loss shot especially high as the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price explored <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-breaks-through-69000-setting-new-record/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">new all-time highs</a> earlier. The price top so far coincided with the peak of this spike in the indicator, where its 7-day MA value hit $3.6 billion.</p>
<p>This profit-taking level was similar to the largest event observed during the last bull run. According to Straten, this is one of the reasons the asset has seen such a massive selloff.</p>

<p>Despite hitting record levels already, the profit-taking may not be ending anytime soon; however, as the analyst says, &#8220;this trend will continue as we are in a bull run and is still relatively mild compared to the 2021 bull run.&#8221;</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>Bullish momentum appears to have returned for Bitcoin as the cryptocurrency has surpassed the $69,000 level after a surge of more than 5% over the past day.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Stalls As Evening Star Forms: Can BTC Bulls Still Shine?</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-evening-star-btc-bulls-still-shine/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-evening-star-btc-bulls-still-shine/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。文章讨论了Bitcoin CME期货月度图表上的“Evening Star”蜡烛图形式可能预示着比特币上升趋势的结束。虽然分析师指出这可能意味着比特币将在接下来的两个季度内达到峰值，但也提出了一些技术分析带来的挑战。此外，尽管比特币最近有所反弹，但目前仍处于熊市突破形态，需要突破70,000美元才能继续上涨。文章还提到了从spot比特币ETF中的流出现象，这可能对市场施加卖压。 <div>
<p>Tony &#8220;The Bull&#8221; Severino, the Head of Research at NewsBTC and a certified CME, has <a href="https://twitter.com/tonythebullBTC/status/1772234677207625779" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">identified</a><a href="https://twitter.com/tonythebullBTC/status/1772234677207625779" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> </a>an &#8220;Evening Star&#8221; candlestick pattern on the monthly chart of the Bitcoin CME futures. This formation, which traditionally indicates a potential trend reversal, is forming at a critical point for Bitcoin. </p>
<p>According to Severino, there could be tell-tale signs suggesting that the Bitcoin upswing could end as the momentum fades.</p>
<h2>The Evening Star Formation: BTC Bull Run Over?</h2>
<p>Though there are concerns that the pattern is forming on the Bitcoin CME futures chart, it is absent from the spot BTCUSD chart on ordinary charts from Binance or Coinbase, for example. Accordingly, the lack of uniformity on charts has also left Severino questioning the reliability of the signal. </p>

<p>While the Evening Star pattern suggests a possible reversal, Severino cautions that Bitcoin could still reach higher highs in the coming months before peaking and reversing. However, the analyst stresses that predicting the exact timing of these events is a challenge. </p>
<p>Based on candlestick analysis, Severino predicts that Bitcoin could peak within the next two quarters, possibly in mid- or late Q3 2024. </p>
<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/x/EU4owKnQ/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Bitcoin price trending upward on the daily chart | Source: BTCUSDT on Binance, TradingView" class="size-full" height="904" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/EU4owKnQ/" width="1787" /></a>
<p>When writing, Bitcoin is trading at around all-time highs. Following the cool-off of last week, the coin bounced back strongly over the weekend, wiping out some losses. The coin is technically within a bearish breakout formation, trading below the 20-day moving average, clear in the daily chart.</p>
<p>For the uptrend to continue and extend from the formation in the daily chart, BTC must push above $70,000. The validity of this uptrend will be solid if the leg up is with expanding trading volume. </p>

<p>Severino also notes that the leg up will be valid and the Evening Star formation invalid if there is a strong close above $74,000 by the end of the month. Bitcoin prices peaked at around $73,800 in early March, buoyed by expanding demand, especially from spot Bitcoin ETFs.</p>
<h2>Spot Bitcoin ETFs Post More Outflows</h2>
<p>Despite the potential for a continued rally, some fundamental factors pose challenges. Notably, outflows from spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), particularly from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), are rising. Rumors suggest that bankrupt crypto lender <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/genesis-face-21-million-penalty-sec-charges-settled/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Genesis</a> could be liquidating its GBTC holdings, adding further selling pressure to the market.</p>
<img alt="Outflows from spot BTC ETF issuers | Source: Lookonchain data" class="size-full wp-image-289501" height="768" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GJSkwmTacAAmJM3.png?resize=1024%2C768" width="1024" />
<p> By March 22, spot Bitcoin ETF issuers had experienced <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1771221747318075748" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">outflows</a> for five straight days, according to Lookonchain data. Nonetheless, as GBTC posts outflows, BlackRock&#8217;s IBIT continues attracting more clients seeking BTC exposure.</p>

<title>Large Shiba Inu Transactions Spark Fears Of A Massive Dumping Spree</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-transactions-spree/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-transactions-spree/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。Shiba Inu的鲸鱼已经在过去24小时内进行了大笔交易，引发了市场担忧。这些交易包括将数十亿SHIB代币转移到不同钱包，并将一些代币转移到Coinbase和Robinhood等交易平台。这可能表明鲸鱼可能计划在市场上抛售他们的持仓，对SHIB价格造成巨大影响。然而，一些投资者可能只是利用最近价格下跌的机会进行积累，因为预计SHIB还有更多上行趋势。当前SHIB价格为$0.00002771，在过去24小时内下跌近1%。 <div>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-pepe-whales-sold/">Shiba Inu (SHIB) whales</a> look to be at it again following large transactions involving the meme token in the last 24 hours. As expected, these transactions have raised concerns that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-23-5-million-shiba-inu/">crypto investors</a> might be looking to offload their tokens on the market. </p>
<h2>Shiba Inu Whales Move Billions Of SHIB</h2>
<p><a href="https://etherscan.io/advanced-filter?tkn=0x95aD61b0a150d79219dCF64E1E6Cc01f0B64C4cE&amp;txntype=2&amp;__cf_chl_rt_tk=.f2yRaOf1TUS7udrjffik62iaeQ_18gwUWkSmNcTtu4-1711353862-0.0.1.1-1471" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">On-chain data</a> shows that Shiba Inu whales moved billions of SHIB in different transactions. In one transaction, 77.2 billion SHIB tokens were moved to a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/coinbase-support-bitcoin-developer-with-3-6-million/">Coinbase wallet</a>. Meanwhile, over 205 billion SHIB tokens were moved across different wallets, some of which were transferred to a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-gets-boost-robinhood-wallet/">Robinhood wallet</a>. </p>

<p>The transfer of some of these tokens to crypto trading platforms, Coinbase and Robinhood, has raised suspicions that these Shiba Inu whales might be planning to sell off their holdings to make some profits. If so, it could massively impact the meme coin’s price due to the magnitude of such transactions. </p>
<p>The SHIB community has seen several smart traders, including MakerDAO founder Rune Christensen, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-whale-dumps-substantial-holdings-on-the-market-heres-how-much/">take profits</a> over the past few weeks. This also contributed to the concern that these recent transactions might involve more whales who want to secure their profits. </p>
<p>However, while the possibility of a sell-off exists, this could be just investors using the recent price dip as an opportunity to <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-whales-shib/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">accumulate more</a> of the meme coin. SHIB experienced a significant price surge, which saw it climb to become the tenth-largest crypto token by market cap. However, it has dropped out of the top 10 after its recent price decline.</p>
<p>The theory of SHIB accumulation looks plausible considering that more upward trend is expected for the crypto token. Therefore, investors will still be looking to position themselves ahead of this bull run, which could see the meme coin <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-dogecoin-shib-excitement/">break its all-time high (ATH)</a>. </p>
<h2>Shiba Inu Still Has Bullish Momentum</h2>
<p>SHIB may be ready for another upward movement if the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-whale-dumps-substantial-holdings-on-the-market-heres-how-much/">wave of profit-taking</a> by investors is now over. Crypto analyst Xanrox <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-whale-dumps-substantial-holdings-on-the-market-heres-how-much/">suggested</a> that the meme coin could hit a new ATH by July, which means more parabolic price moves are to be expected if this price prediction is to be realized by then. </p>

<p>SHIB’s fundamentals also suggest that it is only a matter of time before the upward trend continues. The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-latest-shib-magazine/">Shiba Inu team</a> continues to develop innovations that can help propel SHIB’s price. Meanwhile, although Shibarium’s daily transactions continue to decline, they are likely to pick up at some point, with a massive increase in <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-burns-bright-shib/">SHIB burns</a> expected once that happens. </p>
<p>At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.00002771, down almost 1% in the last 24 hours, according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/shiba-inu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">data</a> from CoinMarketCap. </p>

<title>Crypto Shockwave: Nearly $1 Billion Vanishes From Global Funds In Historic Outflow</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-shock-nearly-billion-vanishes-global-funds/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-shock-nearly-billion-vanishes-global-funds/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。全球加密货币基金经历了近10亿美元的净流出，打破了7周的资金流入纪录。这次规模达到约9.42亿美元的流出是相当显着的，几乎是1月底观察到的5亿美元的先前记录的两倍。主要资产管理公司遭受了撤资风暴，影响了加密货币投资产品领域的交易量和资产估值。此外，不同国家的加密货币基金也出现了资金流动情况，表明全球投资者情绪复杂。此外，大规模撤资还引发了行业领导者之间对比特币ETF在加强市场整合方面的作用和可访问性的讨论。 <div>
<p>Last week, the crypto investment landscape <a href="https://blog.coinshares.com/volume-175-digital-asset-fund-flows-weekly-report-6af2a10c0b30" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">witnessed</a> a significant exodus of capital from global crypto funds. A recent report from CoinShares highlighted nearly $1 billion net outflow from these funds, marking a historic departure from a 7-week inflow streak that had cumulatively amassed $12.3 billion.</p>
<h2>A Closer Look At The Outflows</h2>
<p>The magnitude of these outflows at roughly $942 million is particularly notable, almost doubling the previous record of $500 million witnessed towards the end of January.</p>

<p>Major players in the asset management space, including BlackRock, Bitwise, Fidelity, Grayscale, ProShares, and 21Shares, felt the brunt of this wave of withdrawals, according to CoinShares.</p>
<p>The timing of these outflows coincided with a notable correction in the prices of underlying <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/iceland-prioritizes-food-over-crypto-mining/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">cryptocurrencies</a>, which erased $10 billion from the fund&#8217;s assets under management (AUM). However, the combined AUM of $88 billion still hovers above prior cycle highs.</p>
<p>Notably, these outflows have pronounced impacted trading volumes and asset valuations within the crypto investment product sector. Last week&#8217;s trading volume plummeted by a third to $28 billion amidst a price correction that significantly diminished the AUM of these funds.</p>
<p>The US market, particularly new <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/spot-bitcoin-etf-noobs-panic-selling/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">spot Bitcoin ETFs</a>, witnessed over $1 billion in inflows, which were insufficient to offset the nearly $2 billion <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/back-to-back-negative-bitcoin-etf-flows/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">outflows from Grayscale&#8217;s GBTC fund</a> conversion.</p>
<p>According to CoinShares Head of Research James Butterfill, the &#8220;recent price correction&#8221; resulted in &#8220;hesitancy from investors, leading to much lower inflows into new ETF issuers in the US, which saw US$1.1bn inflows, partially offsetting incumbent Grayscale’s significant US$2bn outflows last week.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Global Crypto Sentiment And Market Responses</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, last week&#8217;s sentiment was not solely concentrated on US-based funds or Bitcoin. Investment products in Sweden, Hong Kong, Switzerland, and Germany also experienced outflows, though Brazil and Canada-based funds recorded inflows, showcasing a mixed global investor sentiment.</p>
<img alt="Crypto asset flows by country." class="wp-image-289492 size-large" height="582" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-25-at-14.57.15.png?resize=980%2C582" width="980" />
<p>Additionally, Ethereum, Solana, and Cardano-based products faced outflows, underscoring the broad impact of the market&#8217;s downturn. In contrast, other altcoin funds like Polkadot, Avalanche, and Litecoin saw net inflows, indicating selective investor interest in the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/doge-ada-cardano-altcoin-season/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">altcoin sector</a>.</p>
<img alt="Crypto asset flows." class="wp-image-289495 size-large" height="644" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-25-at-15.02.47.png?resize=980%2C644" width="980" />
<p>This period of market recalibration has also sparked a dialogue among industry leaders about the role and accessibility of Bitcoin ETFs in fostering broader market integration.</p>
<p>Bivu Das of Kraken UK and Daniel Seifert of Coinbase UK have both <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etf-buzz-in-uk-kraken-executive-pushes-for-market-access/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">advocated for the UK market&#8217;s access to Bitcoin ETFs</a>, citing the importance of such investment products in establishing a comprehensive crypto ecosystem.</p>

<p>As reported, by offering indirect exposure to Bitcoin&#8217;s price movements, these instruments propose a regulated and possibly more accessible avenue for investors, contributing to the diversification and maturity of the investment landscape in the digital currency market.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">ICYMI: Kraken UK Managing Director Bivu Das says he&#8217;d &#8220;absolutely&#8221; like to see a <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">#Bitcoin</a> ETF in the UK, providing regulated access to crypto exposure currently lacking and boost UK&#8217;s crypto hub ambitions, and legitimize bitcoin for institutions.</p>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。Terraform Labs面临高额赔偿金额的审判，涉及其TerraUSD在2022年崩溃所导致的欺诈指控。共同创始人Do Kwon因面临美国和韩国的刑事指控而在黑山等待引渡决定。美国证券交易委员会（SEC）提出的欺诈指控包括虚假声称Terraform的区块链技术被韩国支付应用Chai使用，以及关于TerraUSD稳定性的误导性宣称。庭审将听取关键证人和爆料者的证词，包括涉及芝加哥交易公司Jump Trading的指控。 <div>
<p>Terraform Labs is set to face a high-stakes trial on Monday, grappling with civil fraud allegations linked to the collapse of its <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/terraform-labs-accuses-sec-of-government-overreach/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">TerraUSD stablecoin</a> in 2022. Meanwhile, Terra co-founder Do Kwon remains in Montenegro awaiting the decision on whether he will be extradited to the United States or South Korea to face criminal charges. </p>
<h2>Terraform Labs Faces Trial Over $40 Billion TerraUSD Collapse</h2>
<p>The civil case against Terraform Labs centers on fraud allegations brought forth by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), stemming from the collapse of TerraUSD, which resulted in the loss of approximately $40 billion in investor assets. </p>
<p>According to a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-25/terraform-goes-on-trial-as-kwon-awaits-extradition-in-montenegro" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, the trial will see a Manhattan jury deliberating the fraud claims, examining the SEC&#8217;s allegations regarding Terraform Labs&#8217; “deceitful practices.” </p>

<p>While the trial unfolds, Do Kwon finds himself caught in the Montenegro justice system, awaiting the crucial decision on his <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/do-kwon-released-from-prison-remanded-to-montenegro/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">extradition</a>. Having faced criminal charges in both the US and South Korea, Kwon&#8217;s release from a Montenegro prison on Saturday was accompanied by the country&#8217;s Supreme Court reviewing earlier court rulings regarding his potential extradition to South Korea. </p>
<p>The circumstances surrounding Kwon&#8217;s extradition challenge SEC enforcers, as civil suits typically take a back seat to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/terraform-labs-166m-payment-under-sec-investigation/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">criminal proceedings</a>. Until Kwon is in the US, a criminal trial cannot occur.</p>
<p>In light of these developments, the SEC is seeking a court order to enjoin Terraform Labs and Do Kwon from future violations of US securities laws. In addition, the SEC is seeking <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/montenegro-orders-do-kwon-extradition-to-s-korea/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">civil penalties</a> and disgorgement of ill-gotten gains. </p>
<p>The regulatory authority claims that Terraform Labs defrauded investors by falsely asserting that the popular Korean payment app, Chai, utilized Terraform&#8217;s blockchain technology for processing and settling cryptocurrency transactions. </p>
<p>The SEC further alleges that investors were misled about the stability of TerraUSD, which was purportedly algorithmically &#8220;pegged&#8221; to the US dollar. Terraform Labs strongly denies these allegations, criticizing the SEC&#8217;s characterization of cryptocurrency companies as “lawless.”</p>
<h2>Whistleblowers And Key Witnesses Take The Stand</h2>
<p>Having filed for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/terraform-labs-files-for-bankruptcy-in-the-us/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection</a> in January, Terraform Labs argued it could not pay the penalties sought by federal regulators. Do Kwon, who owns approximately 92% of the company&#8217;s equity, faces the daunting task of navigating these legal battles while Terraform Labs&#8217; fate hangs in the balance. </p>
<p>US District Judge Jed Rakoff, who is presiding over the civil case, ruled in December that Terraform is liable for selling &#8220;unregistered securities.&#8221; This is in line with the SEC&#8217;s hinting that cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin (BTC) are “securities” under the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/terraform-labs-sec-wins-trial-date-january-2024/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Howey test</a>, which many pro-crypto advocates and companies believe is an &#8220;outdated set of rules and laws.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, Terraform maintains that its cryptocurrencies do not fall under the definition of securities, disputes the SEC&#8217;s jurisdiction, and intends to appeal the ruling.</p>

<p>During the trial, the jury is expected to hear evidence regarding the involvement of Jump Trading, a Chicago-based trading firm alleged to have entered into a “secretive arrangement” with Terraform Labs to support TerraUSD before its collapse. </p>
<p>According to Bloomberg, the SEC will allegedly present text messages between Terraform executives discussing the &#8220;depeg,&#8221; where TerraUSD lost its peg to the US dollar in May 2021. </p>
<p>Key witnesses include alleged whistleblowers, a Jump Trading executive, and the chief product officer at the Chai payment app, who aim to demonstrate Terraform and Kwon&#8217;s intentional deception. It is anticipated that Bill DiSomma, co-founder of Jump Trading, will also testify.</p>

<title>Here’s Why The Dogecoin Price Surged Over The Weekend</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-price-surged-weekend/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-price-surged-weekend/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的<br />加密货币 Dogecoin 最近经历了价格价值的指数增长，其价格上涨了35%。据报道，这一增长与 Elon Musk 的支付子公司 X Payment LLC 的最新发展有关，后者成功扩展了在墨西哥、俄勒冈和伊利诺伊州的运营能力。此外，有报道称 DOGE 已经被整合到一家商店，并且 X Payments 可能会将其作为首选支付方式。 DOGE 鲸鱼正在行动，一名投资者近期以 3.75 百万美元购买了 2500 万 DOGE 代币，这也与 X Payments 的扩张努力相吻合，暗示市场情绪可能出现转变。如果 Dogecoin 在 X Payments 中作为支付货币整合，该加密货币可能会吸引更多鲸鱼和新投资者。 <div>
<p>Popular doggy-themed cryptocurrency, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-when-dogecoin-does-this/">Dogecoin,</a> has recently experienced an exponential surge in its price value. Despite its previously <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-growth-holder-activity/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">sluggish price momentum</a>, Dogecoin witnessed a massive $800 million increase in open interest over the weekend. Interestingly, a recent development indicates that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/elon-musk-makes-another-cryptic-tweet/">Elon Musk</a>’s X Payment LLC has greatly contributed to this price pump. </p>
<h2>Why Dogecoin Price Rose 35%</h2>
<p>Over the past 72 hours, the price of Dogecoin witnessed a 35% increase in its value, recording an impressive weekly high of $0.17 on Saturday.  According to <a href="https://app.santiment.net/projects/dogecoin" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">data</a> from Santiment, a crypto analytics platform, the cryptocurrency has also witnessed a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-open-interest-record-2/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">significant rise in open interest</a>, skyrocketing by a remarkable $800 million in value. </p>

<p>This <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-surges-x-payments-secures-3-new-licenses/">massive price surge</a> has been attributed to a recent development in Elon Musk’s payment subsidiary, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/x-payment-integration-dogecoin-included/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">X Payments LLC</a>. According to reports, X Payments has successfully expanded its operational capabilities to three new states. The platform has secured money transmitter licenses in Mexico, Oregon and Illinois.</p>
<p>Following the disclosure of this news, the sentiment surrounding Dogecoin had transformed, as <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/x-payments-dogecoin-integration/">speculations</a> about the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-outperform-dogecoin/">meme coin</a> potentially becoming a preferred payment method for the X Payments began to spread like wildfire. At the time of writing the cryptocurrency is trading at $0.172, reflecting a 14.27% price increase over the past seven days, according to CoinMarketCap. </p>
<p>Interestingly, Dogecoin has already been integrated as a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-gains-momentum-as-musk-hints-at-future-tesla-payments-is-doge-going-to-the-moon/">payment method within Musk’s Tesla</a> merchandise store. In 2023, the SpaceX CEO also teased about the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-x-peer-to-peer-payments/">possibility of DOGE payments on X</a> (formerly Twitter), pushing the broader crypto community on edge as they anticipated the potential inclusion of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/elon-musk-tesla-dogecoin/">DOGE in the payments ecosystem.</a> </p>
<p>Presently, as X Payments expands its services and possibly prepares for a launch, speculations are growing stronger, driving up <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/doge/dogecoin-price-support-0-1220/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dogecoin’s price</a> amidst the rising interest in the cryptocurrency’s potential integration with X Payments.</p>
<h2>DOGE Whales On The Move</h2>
<p>A recent <a href="https://x.com/ali_charts/status/1770798858718560581?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a> has revealed that an <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/big-money-eyes-dogecoin-whale-activity-explodes-600/">anonymous Whale</a> made a substantial purchase of 25 million DOGE tokens, valued at $3.75 million, within the last 72 hours. The timing of this acquisition is particularly noteworthy as it aligns with the recent rise in Dogecoin’s price and open interest over the weekend. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-whales-buying-spree/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Whale’s purchase</a> also coincides with X Payments expansion efforts into new regions, suggesting a potential shift in market sentiment as investors are now showing an <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-open-interest-record/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">elevated interest in DOGE</a>. If Dogecoin becomes integrated as a payment currency within X Payments, the cryptocurrency could witness a significant boost in adoption, potentially attracting more whales and new investors and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-pundit-predicts-price-surge-for-dogecoin/">triggering a substantial price surge.</a></p>

<title>Elon Musk Queries Why Ethereum Founder Buterin Left X</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/elon-musk-queries-ethereum-founder-buterin/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/elon-musk-queries-ethereum-founder-buterin/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章讨论了Ethereum创始人Buterin避开X平台的问题，引起了社区的广泛讨论。Elon Musk和Autism Capital都对此表示关注，指出Buterin较少参与X可能与该平台上的灌水问题有关。但尽管如此，Buterin仍致力于推动Ethereum的技术发展，并支持Farcaster这样与他的去中心化愿景相符的平台。<br />ETH价格目前为3490美元，处于潜在上涨的状态。 <div>
<p>Elon Musk, the tech magnate behind SpaceX and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/elon-musk-tesla-dogecoin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Tesla</a>, has raised questions about Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin&#8217;s apparent retreat from X, the platform Musk acquired in 2022 for $44 billion. The conversation was sparked by a post from &#8220;Autism Capital,&#8221; a crypto influencer with significant clout in the crypto dialogue, who lamented Buterin&#8217;s reduced engagement on X, advocating for its potential to significantly uplift Ethereum&#8217;s presence.</p>
<h2>Why Is The Ethereum Founder Avoiding X?</h2>
<p>“Vitalik needs to get back on X. Farcaster isn’t going to win the culture war. If he wants Ethereum to shine he should engage more on this platform, not sequester himself with his chosen peers on an island. He will have far more impact if he engages the bigger community here,” Autism Capital <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1772172698195526057" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">stated</a>.</p>

<p>Musk&#8217;s straightforward inquiry, &#8220;Why did he leave?&#8221; posed on the platform, has since unleashed a broad spectrum of conjectures and insights from the cryptocurrency community. In the heart of the ensuing conversation, the issue of rampant <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/elon-musk-x-bots-dogecoin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">bot activity</a> on X was flagged as a potential deterrent for Buterin.</p>
<p>A poignant observation was made by a user referencing Tyler John&#8217;s analysis, who <a href="https://twitter.com/tyler_m_john/status/1749025877063606684?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">detailed</a> the spamming issue for the ETH co-founder: “Vitalik Buterin has to append every reply with &#8220;srry 4 ratio-ing&#8221; because immediately afterwards a deluge of sycophants, crypto bots, and followers rains down on the post with tickers, memes, and expressions of praise and all the OP can see is #ETH and $SOL for three days.”</p>
<p>Buterin responded to this in January, stating, “This is (part of) why I do most of my tweeting on farcaster these days srry 4 ratio-ing.”</p>

<p>In the midst of these discussions, Buterin&#8217;s recent <a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">activity on X,</a> albeit limited, remains focused on promoting Ethereum&#8217;s technological strides. Prior to the conversation initiated by Musk and Autism Capital, Buterin highlighted the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), emphasizing its potential to eliminate vulnerabilities like multi-sig backdoors, reflecting his ongoing commitment to the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-buterin-plans-major-changes/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ethereum project</a> despite his sparse presence on X.</p>
<p>However, Buterin&#8217;s advocacy for Farcaster over X is notable. He has praised Farcaster for its decentralized nature and innovative features, such as the channel feature, which he believes offers a superior social media experience. &#8220;Farcaster’s channel feature makes it a better social media platform than X,&#8221; Buterin has stated, illustrating his support for platforms that align with his vision for a decentralized, user-empowered digital ecosystem.</p>
<p>At press time, Ethereum (ETH) price stood at $3,490. In the weekly chart, ETH held above the 0.618 Fib ($3.398), confirming the potential for further upside.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Diamond Hands Weaken As HODLers Sell 669,000 BTC</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-diamond-hands-broken-hodlers-669000-btc/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-diamond-hands-broken-hodlers-669000-btc/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。根据文章的内容，最近一个月比特币的长期持有者已经转移了669,000 BTC。这些持币者通常不轻易出售，但最近的数据显示他们在过去的一个月里大笔出售。这可能与最近的大型事件和价格波动有关。然而，与过去的牛市相比，他们的分发量还不算很大。当前比特币价格已向$67,000水平反弹。 <div>
<p>On-chain data shows the Bitcoin long-term holders, or so-called &#8220;diamond hands,&#8221; have transferred a total of 669,000 BTC over the past month.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Have Sold Big In Past 30 Days</h2>
<p>As explained by CryptoQuant Netherlands community manager Maartunn in a <a href="https://twitter.com/JA_Maartun/status/1772160996901048420" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, the Bitcoin network has observed multiple transactions involving a large amount of dormant coins.</p>
<p>Transfers involving old coins are attributed to the &#8220;<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/hodling-steady-bitcoin-long-term-holder-supply-ath/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">long-term holder</a>&#8221; (LTH) cohort. The LTHs refer to the BTC investors who have been holding onto their coins since more than 155 days ago.</p>

<p>Statistically, the longer an investor holds onto their coins, the less likely they become to sell or transfer the tokens at any point. As such, the LTHs are considered the more resolute part of the market.</p>
<p>These HODLers don&#8217;t easily sell due to this strong conviction and swiftly ride past both periods of downtrends and uptrends. The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-short-term-holders-4-5-profits-nov-2021/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">short-term holders</a> (STHs), who make up for the rest of the sector, are the ones who make panic moves during such periods.</p>
<p>As the LTHs don&#8217;t often sell, the times that they do participate in distribution can be all the more note-worthy. One way to track whether these holders are selling or not is through their 30-day &#8220;net position change,&#8221; which is a metric that keeps track of the net amount exiting or entering the cohort.</p>
<p>Below is the chart shared by Maartunn that reveals the trend in this Bitcoin indicator over the history of the cryptocurrency:</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Long-Term Holder Netflow" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="2580" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GJf7BpAX0AA7d2H?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096" width="4096" /></p>

<p>As displayed in the above graph, the 30-day net position change of the Bitcoin LTHs has assumed a deep red value recently. In the past month, these HODLers have removed 669,000 BTC from their wallets.</p>
<p>Something to keep in mind is that when it comes to accumulation, the net position change has a delay attached to it. This is because the LTH supply only increases 155 days after the purchase has been made, since the newly bought coins have to first mature enough to be a part of this age group.</p>
<p>In the case of distribution, though, the same is obviously not true, since any coins that get transferred on the blockchain have their age reset back to zero instantly.</p>
<p>The recent negative net position spike for the LTHs is quite big. To put things into perspective, the BTC amount that these diamond hands have transacted with this spike is equal to around $44.7 billion in the US Dollar, a staggering value.</p>
<p>It would seem that the latest events of the cryptocurrency, which have included a brand <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-breaks-through-69000-setting-new-record/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">new all-time high (ATH)</a> and a crash, have forced even these diamond hands to break their streak.</p>
<p>From the chart, it&#8217;s visible that the LTHs have sold big when new Bitcoin ATHs have been set in the past bull rallies as well. Interestingly, though, the peak of these spikes has only coincided with a price top partway through each run, and not the actual cycle peak.</p>

<p>In BTC-scale, the negative 30-day net position spike from the LTHs has been smaller this time than both that observed during the 2017 and 2021 bull runs. This is only the case so far, however, as it&#8217;s unclear whether the peak LTH net distribution has ended or not.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>Bitcoin has been making another attempt at recovery during the past few days as its price has now surged back towards the $67,000 level.</p>

<title>XRP Ledger’s Shiny New AMM Runs Into Problems – Here’s What We Know</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-ledger-amm-problems/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-ledger-amm-problems/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章介绍了XRP Ledger（XRPL）新的AMM在推出后遭遇到的一个意外bug。XRPL开发人员发现了系统中的各种不一致之处，导致了问题的出现。开发人员呼吁修复bug，并强调了需要加强测试程序，以及引入Canary Network来增强AMM的稳定性。WietseWind开发人员呼吁建立Canary Network来改善AMM，并提出了这一解决方案的优势。 <div>
<p>Following the <a href="https://x.com/ripplexdev/status/1771271093468193241?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official launch</a> of XRP Ledger’s (XRPL) <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/ripple-amms-to-xrpl-xrp-price/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Automated Market Maker (AMM)</a>, XLS-30, on March 22, developers unearthed various discrepancies linked to a system bug. As a result, an XRPL developer has called for a fix, highlighting the need for enhanced testing procedures and the incorporation of a Canary Network to bolster the AMM’s stability. </p>
<h2>XRPL’s New AMM Encounters Unexpected Bug</h2>
<p>On March 24, the RippleX development team <a href="https://x.com/ripplexdev/status/1771680918895558913?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">unveiled</a> a technical glitch in its newly launched AMM. The revelation comes as a <a href="https://x.com/maria06801698/status/1771969474310127774?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">surprise</a> to the general XRPL community, as they had been eagerly waiting for the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/xrp-news/xrp-not-bank-stablecoin-post-amm/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">protocol to roll out</a>. </p>

<p>According to the official statement released by the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-releases-amm-devnet-unlocks-defi-potential/">RippleX team</a>, the technical glitch surfaced as a result of multiple discrepancies identified in several <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/ripple-cto-amm-xrp-income/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">AMM pools</a>. Upon investigation, the team revealed that the inconsistencies had “affected how the DEX payment engine routes liquidity through the AMM pools and order books.”</p>
<p>Addressing the issue, the development team has assured users that the engineering team were working diligently to resolve the bug issue and restore normal operation in the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-cto-breaks-down-the-amm-feature/">AMM</a>. Additionally, they have advised users to remain cautious and avoid depositing new funds into the AMM pools until the dilemma has been rectified.</p>
<p>Despite the temporary setback, optimism remains in the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/primary-threat-to-xrp-ledger-uncovered/">XRPL</a> community, with many <a href="https://x.com/gootecks/status/1771974042817528258?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">expressing</a> confidence in the development team’s ability to swiftly address the issue. The RippleX team has also <a href="https://x.com/ripplexdev/status/1771961354297241930?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">stated</a> that it has begun reviewing several proposed fixes for the AMM glitch, highlighting that the proposals will have to go through an amendment voting process before any solution is implemented.  </p>
<h2>XRPL Dev Calls For Canary Network</h2>
<p>In response to the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-xrp-ledger-amm-launch-not-affected/">technical challenges </a>faced by XRPL’s new AMM, WietseWind, one of the developers of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-ledger-foundation-ripplex-governance-overhaul/">XRP Ledger</a> has <a href="https://x.com/wietsewind/status/1771998717832278162?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">proposed</a> a long-term solution that could potentially ensure a more stable protocol. According to the developer, the discovery of a bug in the newly <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/coreum-founder-teases-gains-for-xrp-users-with-amm/">launched AMM</a> is evidence of the fragility of the protocol, emphasizing a lack of proper testing before launch.</p>

<p>WietseWind has stated the need for the development of a Canary Network to enhance and improve the AMM. He revealed that the Canary Network will have to be separate from the AMM, while also offering a native asset of some value so individuals can use it for real-life scenarios.</p>
<p>The developer has disclosed that the Canary Network would enable better testing with real value on a network that is not the mainnet. Additionally, it would be an inclusive network for the developers, projects, and everyone within the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrps-underperformance-ruffles-feathers-as-community-asks-ripple-to-do-something-about-price/">XRPL community.</a></p>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的<br />比特币ETF的流出以及美国通胀数据都将影响市场动态。比特币ETF的资金流入对市场情绪至关重要。美国即将发布的个人消费支出指数（PCE指数）可能影响美联储的货币政策。同时，狗狗币将推出期货交易，而Aptos和Fantom网络也有重大发展。Ondo Finance在RWA领域获得成功。BTC目前的交易价格为66,967美元。 <div>
<p>The crypto space is bracing for another eventful week, marked by several key developments and coins that are poised to influence market dynamics. So, here’s what investors and enthusiasts should be on the lookout for.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin: A Watchful Eye On Spot ETF Outflows</h2>
<p>Bitcoin remains at the forefront of investor attention, with the spotlight intensifying on the movements within spot Bitcoin ETFs. After experiencing an unprecedented <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-price-reclaims-66000-despite-4-day-etf-outflow-streak/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">streak</a> of five consecutive days of net negative flows—a first since their inception on January 11—the market is keenly awaiting a potential turnaround.</p>

<h2>US Inflation Data: The PCE Index</h2>
<p>The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Index, set for release this Friday, could have a significant impact on the market. The PCE Index, particularly its core component that excludes food and energy, is the Federal Reserve&#8217;s preferred inflation measure. It offers a broad view of the inflationary pressures within the economy, influencing monetary policy decisions.</p>

<p>The upcoming release, expected to show year-over-year core PCE at 2.8%(last 2.8%) and month-over-month at 0.3% (last 0.4%), holds weight in the Fed&#8217;s interest rate trajectory. Given the Fed&#8217;s pause on rate cuts, the market is keenly observing this data for signals on future monetary policy, especially with Fed Chair Jerome Powell&#8217;s insights anticipated at the end of the week (Friday).</p>
<p>This <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-btc-leading-indicator-cpi-inflation/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">inflation data</a> not only affects traditional finance but could also sway crypto markets, as Bitcoin and other digital assets have increasingly reacted to macroeconomic indicators in recent weeks.</p>
Dogecoin: Futures Trading And &#8216;Doge Day&#8217;
<p>Dogecoin is taking a significant leap forward with Coinbase International&#8217;s announcement of launching DOGE futures trading starting April 1. Coinbase officially <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-surges-x-payments-secures-3-new-licenses/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">announced</a> on Thursday last week, “Coinbase Derivatives will launch the first leveraged and CFTC-regulated futures contracts for Bitcoin Cash, Dogecoin, and Litecoin in April!”</p>
<p>Futures trading for cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin allows investors to speculate on the future price of DOGE without holding the actual cryptocurrency. This can increase liquidity and volatility but also introduce a mechanism for price discovery and hedging against price movements. Coinbase Derivatives&#8217; decision to offer these contracts could attract a new class of investors and traders to Dogecoin, potentially increasing its volatility.</p>
Aptos: Anticipation Of Major Announcements
<p>The Aptos network is on the cusp of potentially game-changing announcements, with speculation about partnerships with major asset managers like <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-private-bitcoin-event/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">BlackRock</a> or Franklin Templeton. The forthcoming &#8216;Aptos DeFi DAYS&#8217; event in Hong Kong from April 2 to 5 could serve as the stage for these revelations, with significant implications for the network&#8217;s valuation and strategic positioning in the DeFi space.</p>
<p>“Aptos is poised for a significant RWA announcement in April. Potential partnership rumors with a major asset manager. (BlackRock/Franklin Templeton) I anticipate that details will be revealed at the &#8216;Aptos DeFi DAYS&#8217; event on April 2”,” research firm Layergg <a href="https://twitter.com/layerggofficial/status/1771797316279980134" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">remarked</a> via X.</p>
Fantom: The Sonic Mainnet Launch
<p>The Fantom Foundation is on the verge of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/fantom-ftm-jumps-180-4-weeks-just-the-beginning/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">launching</a> the Sonic mainnet, a major technological advancement that promises to significantly enhance the blockchain&#8217;s performance and scalability. This upgrade is not just an incremental update but a comprehensive overhaul of Fantom&#8217;s infrastructure, aiming to address some of the most pressing challenges in the blockchain and decentralized application (dApp) ecosystem.</p>

<p>At the heart of the Sonic upgrade is the Fantom Virtual Machine (FVM), a newly developed engine designed to dramatically increase transaction speed and efficiency. This is complemented by the Carmen Database, a breakthrough in data storage that promises to reduce storage requirements by up to 90%. Moreover, the upgrade includes an optimized version of the Lachesis Consensus mechanism, further enhancing the blockchain&#8217;s performance.</p>
<p>These innovations collectively aim to propel Fantom&#8217;s transaction capacity to over 2,000 transactions per second, marking a significant leap towards solving scalability issues that have long plagued blockchain platforms. Scheduled for launch in spring 2024, the Sonic Mainnet could further bolster the Fantom (FTM) price prior to the official release.</p>
Ondo Finance: Riding The Crypto Wave Of RWA
<p>Ondo Finance is the best-performing crypto asset in the top 100 by market cap in the last seven days, with a staggering 93.5% increase in price, following BlackRock&#8217;s announcement of a $100M tokenized asset to fund. As RWA becomes a focal point in the crypto narrative, Ondo Finance&#8217;s association with BlackRock places it at the heart of this burgeoning trend, highlighting the growing intersection between traditional finance and blockchain technology.</p>
<p>“Ondo Finance is the RWA project most associated with BlackRock at this point and Real World Assets (RWA) could be the next major trend in crypto. They are also mentioned as a key project in Bitwise&#8217;s ‘Crypto Use Case 2024’ report,” research firm Layergg stated via X.</p>
<p>At press time, BTC traded at $66,967.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Buying Spree: Robert Kiyosaki Set To Buy 10 More BTC Before April”</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/kiyosaki-set-to-buy-10-more-bitcoin-before-april/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/kiyosaki-set-to-buy-10-more-bitcoin-before-april/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />著名作家罗伯特·清崎再次表达了对比特币的信心，计划在4月之前增加持有量，并预测最大加密货币资产会有显著增长。他提到了即将到来的比特币减半事件，认为这是他购买更多比特币的主要动机。他还建议投资者可以考虑通过Satoshi's或新的ETF购买1/10个比特币。此外，他强调了银币的投资价值，认为银币是目前最具吸引力的资产之一。罗伯特·清崎建议投资者不要投资法定货币，而应该选择银币、黄金或比特币，因为法定货币被认为是危险的。 <div>
<p>Acclaimed Author and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cathie-wood-says-bitcoin-headed-to-1-5-m/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin</a> bull Robert Kiyosaki has once again displayed his confidence in BTC, revealing his intentions of increasing his holdings as he predicts significant gains for the largest cryptocurrency asset.</p>
<h2>Robert Kiyosaki Targets Bitcoin At $100,000</h2>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/robert-kiyosaki-avocates-bitcoin-investment/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Robert Kiyosaki</a> reiterated his positive view on Bitcoin in a recent X <a href="https://x.com/theRealKiyosaki/status/1772115533502259692?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> where he spelled out his thoughts on the digital asset and disclosed his ambitions to purchase an additional 10 BTC before the month of April. The author cites the upcoming Bitcoin Halving event as the true motivation behind his plans to acquire 10 more BTC.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that the highly anticipated <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/why-bitcoin-halving-could-bring-uncertainty-to-mining-industry/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin halving</a> is anticipated to take place in less than 30 days from now. The event is believed to have the potential to be the next big trigger for the entire crypto market.</p>

<p>He further provided an accumulation strategy for investors who are concerned about affordability, suggesting, &#8220;If a buyer is unable to afford a whole BTC, they could want to think about purchasing 1/10 of the coin through Satoshi&#8217;s or the new ETFs.&#8221;</p>
<p>The post stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am buying 10 more Bitcoin before April. Why?  The “Having.” If you can not afford a whole Bitcoin, you may want to consider buying 1/10 of a coin, via the new ETFs or Satoshi’s.</p></blockquote>
<p>According to Robert Kiyosaki, if the aforementioned strategy plays out very well, an investor could own an entire BTC by the end of the year. Kiyosaki is very bullish about the leading crypto asset as he expects BTC to hit the $100,000 threshold by September this year.</p>
<p>He also advocates acquiring Silver coins, especially the United States silver eagles, if an investor is not interested in BTC. His friend Andy Schectman claims that the silver supply, which was formerly plentiful, is almost depleted. The reasons behind this is that China&#8217;s real estate market is toast, and smart money is aware that the US is the world&#8217;s biggest debtor nation. </p>
<p>Additionally, since 1990, Japan has been undergoing a depression; Germany is also experiencing one; mom-and-pop consumers are surviving solely on credit cards; banks are having troubles; and global conflict looms. </p>
<p>As a result, Kiyosaki is urging investors to consider investing in silver in order not to be poor given the current <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/robert-kiyosaki-safeguard-your-wealth-with-bitcoin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">economic uncertainty</a> around the world today.</p>
<h2>Investing In Fiat Currencies Is Not A Smart Idea</h2>
<p>Fiat currencies, sometimes considered fake money, are dangerous to save with, according to Kiyosaki and his associates Andy Schectman and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/good-things-on-the-way-for-bitcoin-investors/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Michael Saylor</a>. This simply suggested that investing in fiat currencies is not a smart move, and those engaging in the act are bound to end up poor in the future.</p>

<p>Thus, they advise everyone to invest in either silver, gold, or Bitcoin, citing that silver is the most affordable among these assets, and nearly everyone in the world can afford one silver coin or BTC Satoshi. &#8220;Coin prices for Bitcoin, Gold, and Silver are approximately $70,000, $2,500, and $35.00, respectively,&#8221; Kiyosaki added.</p>

<title>Battle Of Titans: Bitcoin Leads S&amp;P 500, Michael Saylor Asserts Amid Disagreement</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-leads-sp-500-michael-saylor-asserts/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。加密货币比特币的吸引力持续引发争论，支持者赞扬其不断增长的价值，批评者则警告可能存在泡沫。CEO Michael Saylor展示了比特币对传统资产的惊人增长，强调其作为主要投资力量的地位。然而，经济学家彼得·希夫对数字货币持怀疑态度，特别担忧MicroStrategy的激进投资策略。Saylor认为波动性是市场的自然现象，MicroStrategy增加比特币持有表明他们对数字货币的长期信心。然而，希夫等怀疑者强调了比特币的风险性，尤其是在监管环境不明朗的情况下。 <div>
<p>The allure of Bitcoin continues to spark debate, with proponents touting its skyrocketing value and critics warning of a potential bubble. This weekend, a prominent crypto advocate and CEO, Michael Saylor, reignited the discussion by showcasing Bitcoin&#8217;s impressive gains compared to traditional assets.</p>

<h2><strong>Bitcoin Debate: Saylor Vs. Schiff</strong></h2>
<p>Saylor, the chairman of MicroStrategy, a business intelligence firm, shared a chart highlighting the leading crypto&#8217;s over 430% growth against a backdrop of more modest gains from established investment options like the S&amp;P 500 (56%) and gold (7%). This, according to Saylor, underscores Bitcoin&#8217;s position as a dominant investment force.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">#Bitcoin</a> is Winning. <a href="https://t.co/3ESQRHKEDa" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/3ESQRHKEDa</a></p>
<p>— Michael Saylor<img alt="⚡" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/26a1.png" style="height: 1em;" /> (@saylor) <a href="https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1771638958906110426?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">March 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>However, not everyone is convinced. Renowned economist Peter Schiff, a vocal critic of cryptocurrencies, remains unconvinced. He expressed concern over Saylor&#8217;s aggressive investment strategy, particularly MicroStrategy&#8217;s recent acquisition of over 9,000 BTCs. Schiff emphasizes the inherent volatility of digital currencies, highlighting the potential for significant losses, especially considering MicroStrategy&#8217;s leveraged purchases.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">MicroStrategy has acquired an additional 9,245 BTC for ~$623.0M using proceeds from convertible notes &amp; excess cash for ~$67,382 per <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">#bitcoin</a>.

<p>— Michael Saylor<img alt="⚡" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/26a1.png" style="height: 1em;" /> (@saylor) <a href="https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1770061111146033385?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">March 19, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-289357" height="224" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_8a90a8.png?resize=403%2C224" width="403" /></p>
<p>Saylor, however, remains <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/michael-saylor-to-buy-bitcoin-forever-details/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">unfazed by the recent price dip</a> (nearly 12%) following Bitcoin&#8217;s record high. He views volatility as a natural market phenomenon, even coining the phrase &#8220;volatility is vitality&#8221; to emphasize its role in a healthy market. This confidence extends to MicroStrategy&#8217;s investment strategy. The company has significantly increased its holdings, now totaling over 214,000 BTC, showcasing their long-term faith in the digital currency.</p>
<p>The contrasting views of Saylor and Schiff represent the ongoing debate surrounding Bitcoin. Proponents like Saylor point to its historical growth trajectory and its potential to disrupt traditional financial systems. They believe the digital asset&#8217;s limited supply (21 million coins will ever be mined) makes it a valuable hedge against inflation, similar to gold.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/vWYGx9uW/" width="1835" /></p>

<h2><strong>Risks And Regulations</strong></h2>
<p>However, skeptics like Schiff highlight the risks associated with <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">BTC price fluctuations.</a> Unlike established assets with underlying fundamentals like company performance or resource scarcity, Bitcoin&#8217;s value relies heavily on speculation and market sentiment. A sudden shift in investor confidence could trigger a dramatic price drop, leading to significant losses for investors like MicroStrategy.</p>
<p>Further complicating the picture is the evolving regulatory landscape surrounding cryptocurrencies. Governments worldwide are still grappling with how to regulate this new asset class. Stringent regulations could stifle innovation and adoption, potentially hindering Bitcoin&#8217;s future growth.</p>

<title>Why Tomorrow (March 26) Will Be Pivotal For Ripple And XRP</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/march-26-pivotal-for-ripple-xrp/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/march-26-pivotal-for-ripple-xrp/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章涉及XRP诉讼中的关键阶段，SEC已提交了开放性有关救济的文件，并计划在2024年3月26日公开。文章强调了SEC要求的救济金额的重要性，并提到了Ripple对其财务状况的保密性抗议。还提供了有关未来时间表的详细信息，包括法院文件的封存和编辑程序。文章指出了潜在的延迟可能性和不确定性。 XRP目前交易价格为$0.63218。 <div>
<p>In the XRP lawsuit, the next crucial phase is set to commence for Ripple Labs against the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) tomorrow. Defense lawyer James K. Filan has recently casted the spotlight on March 26.</p>
<p>The SEC has already submitted its opening remedies-related brief along with supporting documentation, albeit under seal, to the court. This step is a significant progression in the protracted legal dispute that has spanned several years. Filan&#8217;s <a href="https://twitter.com/FilanLaw/status/1771316749641687403" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">statement</a> via X emphasizes the forthcoming public disclosure of these documents, slated for no later than March 26, 2024.</p>

<p>&#8220;The SEC has filed, under seal, its opening remedies-related brief and supporting documents. These documents are not public yet. Public, redacted versions will be filed no later than Tuesday, March 26, 2024,&#8221; Filan communicated, highlighting the importance of this date in the context of the Ripple vs. SEC case.</p>
<h2>Ripple Vs. SEC: What To Expect</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s crucial to understand the nature and significance of an &#8220;opening remedies-related brief.&#8221; This document represents a foundational element in the litigation process. Essentially, the opening remedies-related brief is the initial submission by a party—in this instance, the SEC—outlining the specific legal and financial remedies it seeks from the court against the opposing party, Ripple Labs.</p>
<p>The amount of remedies that the SEC is demanding is eagerly awaited. In particular, it will be interesting to see how much the SEC demands for the institutional XRP sales after the start of the legal dispute.</p>
<p>As Bitcoinist <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sec-victory-ripple-disclosure-financial-statements/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">reported</a>, US District Judge Analisa Torres has ordered Ripple to provide its financial statements from 2022-2023 and contracts about <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-lawsuit-ripple-sec-settlement-rumors/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">“Institutional Sales” of XRP</a> in February, which the SEC argues are essential for determining an appropriate remedy.</p>

<p>Despite Ripple&#8217;s assertion that details regarding its financial health are both irrelevant to the case and highly confidential, the court has found such information potentially significant to the remedy stage of the proceedings. In its motion, the SEC contended that access to the company&#8217;s financial data is crucial for establishing the scale and nature of penalties and remedies that should be applied.</p>
<p>Just a few days ago, Ripple Labs and the SEC <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-lawsuit-ripple-sec-agreement-schedule/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">presented</a> a detailed schedule for the remedies phase to the Southern District Court of New York. This agenda outlines the procedures for sealing and redacting court documents pertinent to the remedies phase of the lawsuit—a critical aspect of the proceedings that will determine the legal and financial repercussions for Ripple Labs</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>March 22, 2024:</strong> The SEC filed its remedies brief under seal.</li>
<li><strong>March 25, 2024:</strong> A meeting between the SEC and Ripple to discuss and finalize the necessary redactions is happening today.</li>
<li><strong>March 26, 2024:</strong> The SEC&#8217;s deadline to file a public, redacted version of its opening brief.</li>
<li><strong>April 22, 2024:</strong> Ripple&#8217;s deadline to file its opposition brief.</li>
<li><strong>April 23-24, 2024:</strong> A planned meeting to finalize redactions for Ripple&#8217;s documents. If necessary Ripple will file a public, redacted version of its opposition brief.</li>
<li><strong>May 8, 2024:</strong> The SEC&#8217;s deadline for the public submission of its reply brief.</li>
</ul>
<p>The provided timeline offers clarity on the immediate procedural steps. Despite this clarity, there remains a level of uncertainty regarding the ultimate resolution of the case. Speculation about potential delays persists, particularly concerning whether the SEC may request an extension.</p>
<p>At press time, XRP traded at $0.63218.</p>

<title>Shiba Inu’s Shibarium Hits New Record Amid Chaotic Market Movements</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inus-shibarium-hits-new-record-amid-chaotic-market-movements/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inus-shibarium-hits-new-record-amid-chaotic-market-movements/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的<br />Shibarium, Shiba Inu's layer-2 solution,达到了超过367万美元的锁定总价值（TVL）的历史最高水平。此外，DAMN代币的推出和WoofSwap上的液态质押解决方案推动了Shibarium的TVL激增。这一里程碑显示了网络效应的潜力，带来了更多的用户，可能会推动SHIB价格进一步上涨。随着SHIB价格在短短24小时内上涨8.8%，投资者和链上指标显示未来会继续价格上涨的迹象。Lucie表示，SHIB价格可能在4月份的半减产前进一步上涨。 <div>
<p>Shibarium, Shiba Inu’s layer-2 solution, recently reached an all-time high total value locked (TVL) of over $3.67 million. As if the current bullish sentiment around the Shiba Inu&#8217;s ecosystem isn&#8217;t enough, its layer-2 solution has now reached a milestone that could lead to a further price surge. </p>

<p>According to data from <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Shibarium" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">DeFiLlama</a>, the total value locked on Shibarium jumped from $1.43 million on March 22 to $3.38 million on March 23, sparking optimism about SHIB’s price.</p>
<h2><b>Shibarium TVL Surges To New Milestone</b></h2>
<p>Shibarium’s total value locked hitting a new high shows the network effect in action. Interestingly, data shows Shibarium&#8217;s TVL has spent most of the year below $1 million before crossing over in late February. However, the TVL stands at $3.67 at the time of writing, revealing a positive change in the ecosystem. </p>
<p>The recent surge in TVL can be particularly attributed to the launch of the DAMN token on WoofSwap, which is a decentralized exchange built on the Shibarium. DAMN quickly gained attention as one of the hottest cryptocurrencies after its launch on March 18. </p>
<p>According to data from <a href="https://www.shibariumscan.io/stats" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Shibariumscan</a>, this frenzy led to a surge in the number of daily active users to 2,482 on the day of its launch. Similarly, WoofSwap&#8217;s TVL has grown by 8,988% in the past seven days. </p>
<p>Another catalyst for the surge in TVL was the launch of KNINE tokens, a liquid staking solution on the Shibarium blockchain.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/IdmMEKDj/" width="2475" /></p>

<h2><b>What’s Next For Shiba Inu?</b></h2>
<p>Naturally, Shibarium’s recent milestones have sparked <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-price-soars-10-in-reaction-to-explosive-2367-shib-burn-surge/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">optimism about SHIB’s price</a> as the cryptocurrency is well known to react to updates about the layer-2 network. This growth shows that Shibarium is attracting more users, which could boost SHIB’s price. </p>
<p>Shibarium&#8217;s new milestone saw SHIB rallying 8.8% to $0.00002828 in less than 24 hours. This price rally highlights the close correlation between the growth of Shibarium and the SHIB price.</p>
<p>SHIB is trading at $0.00002806 at the time of writing. The cryptocurrency is in fact, still riding on the back of a 193% gain in the past 30 days <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-short-term-holders/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">despite being 37% down</a> from its $0.00004456 earlier in the month. </p>

<p>On-chain metrics and investor sentiment point to a continued price surge in the near future. On-chain analytics platform Santiment recently pointed out that Bitcoin, along with SHIB and other meme coins, remained the focus of traders throughout the weekend. SHIB, which naturally has a <a href="https://app.intotheblock.com/coin/SHIB" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">strong price correlation</a> with Bitcoin, could <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-market-cap-price-surgeretesting-2021-highs/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reignite a surge in tandem</a>.</p>
<p>According to Lucie, Shiba Inu&#8217;s marketing lead, the price of SHIB could <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-rise-250-pre-bitcoin-halving/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">surge by 250%</a> before the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/why-bitcoin-halving-could-bring-uncertainty-to-mining-industry/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">next Bitcoin halving</a> which is slated to occur in April.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章提到Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood重申了对比特币的看法，预测其价格可能达到380万美元。Wood认为比特币是一个“金融高速公路”，强调了其在新兴市场中的重要性，并指出其价格可能在未来继续上涨。她还提到了比特币在发展中国家中的采用情况，以及机构对比特币的兴趣增加以及SEC对机构投资比特币的批准，将是比特币价格上涨的重要推动力。此外，文章还提到了比特币最近的价格走势以及Spot Bitcoin ETFs的推出。 <div>
<p>Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood has reiterated her <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/cathie-wood-bitcoin-gold/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">bullish stance</a> on Bitcoin. The investment mogul, who recently disclosed she <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cathie-wood-placed-25-wealth-bitcoin-bold-unveiled/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">allocated 25% of her wealth</a> into Bitcoin, has now predicted the cryptocurrency is on a highway to new highs. </p>

<p>Particularly, Wood called Bitcoin a “financial super highway,” amidst discussions of its importance in emerging markets. As a result, she reiterated that the price of Bitcoin could end up as high as $3.8 million.</p>
<h2><b>Cathie Wood Reiterates Bullish Stance On Bitcoin</b></h2>
<p>Wood made her <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cathie-wood-bitcoin-is-king-of-security/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">very bullish prediction</a> at a Friday Bitcoin Investor Day conference in New York. Interestingly, this recent prediction surpasses another one made in January where she predicted that the digital asset <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cathie-wood-sees-bitcoin-at-1-5m-by-2030/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">could potentially hit $1.5 million</a> by 2030. This means Bitcoin could increase by another $2.3 million after reaching her existing target. </p>
<p>Wood credits this price growth to a major shift in the global market dynamics as Bitcoin continues to receive adoption, especially in developing countries. She made a case of Nigeria, whose struggle with unprecedented inflation in recent times has pushed its citizens to run to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to hedge against inflation. </p>
<p>“There are signals that not all is well in the world,” she said.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Wood revealed that Ark Invest, her investment company, has now <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/ark-invest-pivots-to-bitcoin/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">diverted most of its attention</a> into emerging markets such as this. She also noted that Bitcoin could continue on a price surge as institution interest continues to rise and institutions start to allocate a little more than 5% of their portfolio to the cryptocurrencies. </p>
<p>At the same time, Wood believes the US Securities and Exchange Commission’s recent greenlight for institutional investment in Bitcoin is a huge driving force for its growth to $3.8 million.</p>
<p>“We think Bitcoin has miles to go,” Wood said.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/Ju7s87Iy/" width="1835" /></p>

<h2><b>What’s Next For Bitcoin?</b></h2>
<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at $64,256, up by 25% in the past 30 days. Most of Bitcoin&#8217;s price growth in the past few months has been centered around the launch of Spot Bitcoin ETFs in the US. Wood&#8217;s Ark Invest was one of the Bitcoin ETF issuers approved by the SEC and has done relatively well since then. These ETFs have now received a total net flow of $11.269 billion since their launch.</p>

<p>Bitcoin, however, is <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-long-term-holders-price-top-glassnode/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">currently struggling</a> with its price surge. The crypto is now down 12% from an all-time high of $73,780 which it <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/breaking-news-ticker/breaking-bitcoin-hits-new-all-time-high-surging-past-70000-for-the-first-time-in-history/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">attained earlier in the month</a>. At the same time, Spot Bitcoin ETFs witnessed <a href="https://x.com/BitMEXResearch/status/1771465855680823612?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">consecutive days of outflows</a> last week amidst the price struggle. On the other hand, Bitcoin continues to <a href="https://x.com/santimentfeed/status/1771358045098086909?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">attract bullish sentiment</a> from investors and the cryptocurrency could resume its price surge very soon. </p>

<title>From Bytes To Bites: Iceland Prioritizes Food Over Crypto Mining</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章介绍了冰岛政府从支持加密货币挖矿产业向增强国内食品生产的转变。由冰岛总理领导的这一战略决定旨在增加食品安全和实现更平衡的能源网络，为冰岛带来更绿色和更自给自足的未来。这一举措将增加农业产出，增强食品安全，创造就业机会，刺激本地经济，并通过将清洁能源供应给更广泛的农业运营来扩大冰岛强大的可再生能源网络。对于现有的加密货币挖矿运营在冰岛的影响尚待观察，但冰岛的战略转变标志着全球对资源负责任使用和长期可持续性重要性的讨论。 <div>
<p>Iceland, the volcanic island nation famed for its stunning landscapes and clean energy production, is embarking on a new chapter. In a move that highlights a growing global trend, The country is<a href="https://bitperfect.pe/en/iceland-pm-sways-energy-use-away-from-crypto-mining-to-agriculture/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> shifting its focus</a> from supporting the cryptocurrency mining industry towards bolstering domestic food production.</p>
<h2><strong>Iceland Pivots: From Crypto To Crops</strong></h2>
<p>This strategic decision, driven by a desire for increased food security and a more balanced energy grid, positions Iceland for a greener and more self-sufficient future.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Katrín Jakobsdóttir spearheaded this shift, citing the need to prioritize sectors with a more direct impact on national well-being. While crypto mining has played a role in our renewable energy sector, stated Jakobsdóttir, they recognize the importance of a balanced and sustainable approach. By prioritizing food production, the government ensures its constituents have access to a secure and reliable food supply.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-289266" height="290" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_335c72.png?resize=523%2C290" width="523" /></p>


<p>Iceland&#8217;s abundance of geothermal and hydroelectric power plants has made it a global leader in renewable energy production per capita. This same clean energy has also fueled the rise of <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6432a24b-b7c4-4c2f-85a8-79108dbe0644" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">crypto mining operations</a> within the country. However, concerns surrounding the environmental impact of crypto mining, coupled with a desire for greater food independence, have prompted this strategic pivot.</p>
<p>The move towards domestic food production presents a multitude of benefits for the country. Increased agricultural output will not only bolster food security but also create new jobs and stimulate the local economy.</p>












<h2><strong>Renewable Energy And Agriculture</strong></h2>
<p>Furthermore, this shift creates an opportunity to expand the reach of Iceland&#8217;s robust renewable energy grid. By supplying clean energy to a wider range of agricultural operations, the country can ensure a more sustainable and efficient food production system.</p>












<p>According to Jakobsdóttir, the energy demands of the country&#8217;s 375,000 citizens should take precedence over data centres and instead use precious renewable electricity for homes and other sectors.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/3XxLQse5/" width="1835" /></p>

























<p>“Bitcoin is an issue worldwide . . . but data centers in Iceland use a significant share of our green energy,” the prime minister said. A new proposal to boost wind power would put more premium on clean industries to achieve carbon neutrality, she added.</p>

<p>The transition to a larger-scale food production industry, however, is not without its challenges. Iceland&#8217;s harsh climate and limited arable land necessitate innovative solutions.</p>
<p>Experts believe that advancements in controlled-environment agriculture (CEA) technologies, such as hydroponics and vertical farming, will play a crucial role in overcoming these limitations.</p>
<p>The impact of this decision on existing crypto mining operations in Iceland remains to be seen. While some operations may choose to relocate, others might adapt by utilizing more energy-efficient mining practices. Regardless, Iceland&#8217;s strategic shift signifies a growing global conversation about the responsible use of resources and the importance of long-term sustainability.</p>
<p>By prioritizing food security and a robust domestic agricultural sector, Iceland is charting a course for a greener and more self-sufficient future. This decision serves as a model for other nations grappling with similar challenges, demonstrating the potential of clean energy to not only power a digital future but also cultivate a more sustainable food system.</p>

<title>Bitcoin ETF Buzz In UK: Kraken Executive Pushes For Market Access</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etf-buzz-in-uk-kraken-executive-pushes-for-market-access/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章讨论了在英国重新燃起的关于比特币交易所交易基金（ETFs）的辩论，行业领袖呼吁为投资者提供更广泛的访问权限。Kraken UK的Bivu Das认为，比特币ETFs为建立英国作为真正的加密中心提供了基本基础。尽管FCA仍保持谨慎态度，但最近批准了加密ETNs的推出，这表明他们可能会对更广泛的加密投资机会持开放态度。Coinbase UK CEO Daniel Seifert也支持扩大投资选择，认为更多的投资产品如ETFs会为消费者提供更多选择。文章指出，尽管FCA需顾及保护零售投资者免受潜在危害，但随着全球对比特币ETF的接受程度不断增加和投资者需求增加，FCA可能不可避免地将采取更开放的监管态度。 <div>
<p>The simmering debate over Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in the UK has reignited, with industry leaders calling for wider access for investors. This comes on the heels of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving Bitcoin ETFs in January, sparking a surge in investment and renewed calls for a similar move by the UK&#8217;s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).</p>

<h2><strong>UK&#8217;s Bitcoin ETF Advocacy</strong></h2>
<p>Bivu Das, Managing Director of Kraken UK, believes Bitcoin ETFs offer a &#8220;basic fundamental&#8221; for establishing the UK as a true crypto hub. These instruments allow investors to gain exposure to Bitcoin&#8217;s price movements without directly owning the cryptocurrency itself, potentially offering a more regulated and accessible entry point.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">ICYMI: Kraken UK Managing Director Bivu Das says he&#8217;d &#8220;absolutely&#8221; like to see a <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">#Bitcoin</a> ETF in the UK, providing regulated access to crypto exposure currently lacking and boost UK&#8217;s crypto hub ambitions, and legitimize bitcoin for institutions.</p>
<p>— AP Crypto (@AP_Crypto_) <a href="https://twitter.com/AP_Crypto_/status/1771514821940547931?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">March 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>However, the FCA remains cautious. In 2021, they banned the retail sale of crypto-derivative products, including exchange-traded products (ETPs) backed by cryptocurrencies. This stance, some argue, puts the UK at a disadvantage compared to the US, where retail investors can readily invest in <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etf-alert-analyst-issues-major-warning/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin ETFs.</a></p>
<p>Das contends that the regulatory landscape has evolved since the 2021 ban. He believes ETFs could even alleviate some regulatory concerns, as investors wouldn&#8217;t directly hold the underlying Bitcoin. This could potentially pave the way for a more open approach from the FCA.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/WjE9FkAe/" width="1835" /></p>

<p>There are signs the FCA might be inching towards a more accommodating stance. They recently approved the launch of crypto ETNs, but only for institutional investors. This move, while limited, could be seen as a cautious step towards wider crypto investment opportunities.</p>
<p>While the regulatory body remains cautious, warning of potential risks for retail investors in the volatile crypto market, the FCA&#8217;s recent actions suggest a willingness to explore the space further.</p>

<h2><strong>Expanding UK&#8217;s Investment Options</strong></h2>
<p>Coinbase UK CEO, Daniel Seifert, echoes Das&#8217; sentiment. He believes &#8220;consumers have more options&#8221; with a wider range of investment products like ETFs. This push for increased investor choice aligns with a broader trend towards democratizing access to financial markets.</p>
<p>However, the FCA faces a delicate balancing act. While fostering innovation in the crypto sector is crucial for maintaining the UK&#8217;s financial competitiveness, protecting retail investors from potential harm remains a top priority. The high volatility of the crypto market raises concerns about the suitability of such complex instruments for inexperienced investors.</p>
<p>The recent influx of billions into US<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> Bitcoin</a> ETFs highlights the growing investor appetite for these products. This surge in demand could put further pressure on the FCA to revisit its stance. The potential benefits of increased investment and a more robust crypto ecosystem could outweigh the perceived risks, eventually leading to a more open regulatory environment.</p>
<p>The future of Bitcoin ETFs in the UK remains uncertain. The FCA is likely to take a measured approach, carefully evaluating the potential benefits and risks before making any significant changes. However, the growing global acceptance of Bitcoin ETFs, coupled with increasing investor demand, suggests that a more open approach from the FCA might be inevitable.</p>

<title>US Bitcoin Miners Move Old Equipment Overseas – Here’s Why</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章首先介绍了比特币减半事件即将到来，导致挖矿收入减半。随后提到美国挖矿者正准备应对后果，其中600,000台旧型号矿机计划转移到非洲和南美等成本更低的地区。特别关注埃塞俄比亚作为比特币挖矿中心的发展，因为当地廉价电力吸引了大量旧型矿机的转移。Ethiopia的电价仅为每千瓦时3美分，这是吸引挖矿者的主要因素之一。 <div>
<p>The Bitcoin halving, one of the most anticipated crypto events in 2024, is less than a month away, and miners seem to be in full preparation for its aftermath. The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/why-bitcoin-halving-could-bring-uncertainty-to-mining-industry/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">April event is expected to slash mining rewards on the Bitcoin network in half</a>, making the validation of transactions less lucrative.</p>
<p>As of now, miners receive 6.25 BTC for each validated block added to the network. However, the halving will split their revenue to 3.125 BTC for each block. Interestingly, many miners in the United States seem to be making adjustments, including upgrading to more efficient mining computers, to ensure they remain profitable.</p>
<h2>Why Bitcoin Mining Machines Are Being Moved Out Of The US</h2>
<p>According to crypto-mining services and logistics provider Luxor Technology, about 600,000 S19 series mining rigs, which account for a large proportion of machines currently in use in the United States, are being moved out of the country. The mining computers are being transferred (or sold) primarily to countries in Africa and South America, a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-23/bitcoin-halving-spurs-exodus-of-old-us-mining-computers-abroad" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bloomberg report</a> revealed.</p>

<p>The S19 series are older models of Bitcoin mining machines, and they might not be cost-efficient to run in countries like the US, where energy costs are relatively high. <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-halving-havoc-only-a-few-miners-may-survive/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">This explains why the miners in the country</a> are ditching the older computers for more efficient ones.</p>
<p>The report quoted another major player in the Bitcoin mining industry, saying that while the S19 series and similar models might not be cost-effective to operate in the United States, they “can still generate decent profits and get an extended life if hosted” in certain regions in Africa.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some miners opt to sell their hardware, with buyers of the old machines operating in parts of the world with cheap power. Many of these buyers are from Paraguay, Uruguay, Tanzania, and, most notably, Ethiopia.</p>
<p>According to Luxor, the upcoming halving event has been influencing the behavior of buyers towards the purchase of old mining machines. “Some buyers are waiting until after the event to purchase older computers, assuming their prices will drop even more,” the company revealed.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">With the Bitcoin halving approaching, Luxor estimates that around 600,000 S19 bitcoin rigs, the majority of machines currently in use, are moving primarily out of the U.S. to places like Africa and South America, where energy is cheaper. The S19 can cost up to $11,500 per unit to…</p>

<p></p>
<h2>Ethiopia: The Next Crypto Mining Hub?</h2>
<p>Ethiopia, a country located in the Horn of Africa, is forging a strong reputation for itself in the crypto and Bitcoin mining niche. As inferred earlier, a significant proportion of the old US machines are being transferred to the East African nation.</p>

<p>Ethiopia’s cheap electricity has been pinpointed as the major factor driving this development. The Bloomberg report revealed that electricity is about 3 cents per kWh in Ethiopia, while it ranges between <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ex-white-house-official-says-bitcoin-could-reach-170000-post-halving/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">3 to 6 cents in the US</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier in February, Bloomberg disclosed that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-migration-chinese-miners-flock-to-ethiopia/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Chinese crypto mining companies are increasing their investment in Ethiopia</a>. While China’s strict stance against cryptocurrency is believed to have played a role, Ethiopia’s cheap power seems to have played a bigger part in the firms’ move.</p>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。<br />文章提到了Ava Labs联合创始人Emin Gün Sirer对一些Layer-2解决方案的警示，指出这些项目可能对投资者构成风险。他列举了几个常见的红旗，包括项目的故事与技术之间的不一致，中心化的序列器，通过代币销售筹集资金等。此外，他还提出了一个简单的测试，帮助投资者筛选真正有价值的项目，建议评估项目是否为当前加密生态系统的关键问题提供了真正的解决方案。 <div>
<p>Co-founder of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/citibank-trials-tokenization-equity-funds-avalanche/">Avalanche blockchain</a>, Emin Gün Sirer, has raised an alert on the infiltration of certain layer-2 solutions, which poses risks to investors. In an <a href="https://twitter.com/el33th4xor/status/1771658050228617428" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">X post on March 23</a>, the Ava Labs boss expressed concerns over these “trash” projects while educating users on several of their common characteristics.</p>

<h2>Red Flags To Watch For In L2 Projects &#8211; Avalanche Co-founder </h2>
<p>According to Gün Sirer, the rise in substandard L2 projects represents the next big hazard in the crypto ecosystem following the crypto exchange heist pulled off by former<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-50-years/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> FTX founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF)</a>. The prominent crypto figure argued the procedures involved in launching an L2 solution were rather loose, allowing the influx of bad actors who created projects with no actual value. </p>
<p>In the interest of promoting investor security, Emin Gün Sirer then proceeded to list several red flags that accompany these risky L2 solutions. Firstly, he stated that there is usually a discrepancy between the project’s narrative and technology, i.e., its marketing pitch does not align with its technical implementation. </p>
<p>Examples of such projects are those with centralized sequencers without fraud-proof, which is against the cryptocurrency principles of decentralization and security. Emin Gün Sirer also highlighted L2 solutions that conduct token sales to raise funds rather than for a specific, practical purpose on the network, indicating it was likely to be a dubious investment. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the Avalanche co-founder also spoke about L2 projects in which founders sold their personal native tokens before the launch. Regardless of the motive, Gün Sirer characterized a large volume of native token sales pre-launch as a massive red flag. </p>
<p>Another point the crypto figure highlighted was projects with low-float tokens which allow for artificial inflation of the token’s value through manipulation tactics as commonly done by SBF. Finally, Gün Sirer advised investors to pay attention to project founders&#8217; morals and habits and screening for any form of personal misconduct.

<h2>The Simple Authenticity Test By Emin Gün Sirer</h2>
<p>In addition to the red flags mentioned above, Emin Gün Sirer also proposed a simple test that could help investors in screening through the masses of L2 projects being launched daily for authentic, profitable ventures. </p>
<p>Firstly, the Ava Labs founder suggested identifying the main issues &#8211; known as “blockers” &#8211; in the crypto space at any time. He stated that, for example, issues such as scalability and performance were quite significant until blockchains such as Avalanche and<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-meme-coin-mania-breaks-records/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> Solana</a> emerged with solutions. </p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Emin Gün Sirer believes that supporting multiple use cases on the same platform as well as integration with traditional finance (TradFi) are currently critical issues facing the crypto ecosystem. Before investing in an L2 solution, the Avalanche co-founder advises users to assess where the project offers a genuine solution to these challenges. </p>

<p>According to the filing, the sale of the two private aircraft has been sought to prevent their devaluation, as these <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ftx-ceos-asset-recovery-escalates-as-sam-bankman-fried-trial-looms/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">assets</a> were previously slated for forfeiture in October 2023 due to their connection to <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/ftx/sam-bankman-fried-allegedly-used-customer-funds/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Bankman-Fried’s criminal case</a>.  </p>
<p>Currently, the government has not disclosed the precise selling price for the private aircrafts. However, they have appraised the jets at $15.9 million and $12.5 million, respectively. </p>
<p>Furthermore, Williams has revealed that the court order was made in agreement with multiple parties including FTX’s former executive, Ryan Salame, the defendant, the founder of Trans-Island Airways, Paul Aranha, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-revised-settlement-proposal-amid-objection/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">FTX debtors</a>, the government, Capital Peak Aviation and Island Air Capital (IAC). </p>
<p>The attorney disclosed that the Embraer Legacy aircraft will be transported to a Florida airport by the IAC, with the delivery expected within 30 days of the court order. </p>
<p>As for the Global 5000 aircraft, the filing has revealed that it remains under secure custody, controlled by the United States Marshals Service (USMS). The USMS will manage the jet’s sale proceedings, which will be held in escrow within the enforcement agency’s Seized Asset Deposit Fund (SADF) until further order of the court. </p>

<title>SEC Chair Gary Gensler Says Crypto Industry Needs ‘Disinfectant’ – Here’s Why</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/gary-gensler-says-crypto-needs-disinfectant/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/gary-gensler-says-crypto-needs-disinfectant/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。SEC主席Gensler强调了加密货币市场的透明度和强制披露的重要性。他警告了那些试图避开注册要求的参与者，并呼吁更严格的监管。他还强调了创新与透明度和投资者保护之间的平衡，并指出比特币的波动性。通过促进更加公开透明的市场, Gensler的讲话可能导致加密货币生态系统更加稳健可信，吸引更多的机构和零售投资者。 <div>
<p>In a passionate address to Columbia Law School, Gary Gensler, the Chair of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), delivered <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/speech/gensler-remarks-columbia-law-school-032224" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">a scathing critique of crypto industry participants</a> who evade registration requirements.</p>
<h2><strong>Promoting Transparency in Cryptocurrency</strong></h2>
<p>Gensler&#8217;s speech focused on the need for transparency and mandatory disclosure in the cryptocurrency markets, drawing on the famous quote by Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis that &#8220;Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.&#8221;</p>

<p>Gensler expressed his concern about certain participants in the crypto securities markets who seek to avoid registration requirements, thereby evading mandatory disclosure. He stressed the importance of transparency in the industry and highlighted the potential benefits of applying stricter regulatory oversight.</p>
<p>By shining a light on the practices and operations of market participants, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/trader-warns-sec-chair-gensler-shouldnt-be-trusted/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Gensler</a> aimed to promote a more accountable and trustworthy crypto ecosystem.</p>
<blockquote>
&#8220;There are participants in crypto securities markets that seek to avoid these registration requirements. No registration means no mandatory disclosure. Many would agree that the crypto markets could use a little disinfectant,&#8221; he said.
</blockquote>
<p>The SEC Chair&#8217;s remarks come at a time when the commission is actively pursuing<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sec-crypto-lawyers-leave-as-genslers-grip-tightens/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> enforcement actions against major crypto firms,</a> including Kraken, Binance, Ripple, and Coinbase. These actions underscore the SEC&#8217;s commitment to ensuring compliance within the industry.</p>
<p>However, Gensler&#8217;s focus on transparency goes beyond enforcement, as he believes that the entire crypto market can benefit from increased disclosure and regulatory compliance.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/alD4Mo1l/" width="1835" /></p>

<h2><strong>Gensler&#8217;s Regulatory Vision</strong></h2>
<p>Advocacy groups and crypto companies have long called for clear regulatory guidelines to foster innovation within the United States. While Gensler acknowledged the importance of innovation, he emphasized that it should not come at the expense of transparency and investor protection.</p>
<p>By advocating for mandatory disclosure and registration requirements, Gensler seeks to strike a balance between fostering innovation and maintaining market integrity.</p>
<p>Gensler&#8217;s call for transparency aligns with his previous warnings that cryptocurrency exchanges must register with the SEC and adhere to the same rules as traditional financial companies. He has consistently emphasized the need for accountability and regulation in the crypto space, aiming to ensure that investors are adequately informed and protected.</p>

<p>In addition to his focus on transparency, Gensler also addressed the risks associated with investing in cryptocurrencies. He likened Bitcoin to a roller coaster ride, cautioning investors about the volatility of the asset. While acknowledging the market&#8217;s enthusiasm, he stressed the importance of evaluating the fundamentals of cryptocurrencies to make informed investment decisions.</p>
<p>As Gensler&#8217;s &#8220;disinfectant&#8221; tirade reverberates throughout the cryptocurrency industry, stakeholders are left contemplating the future of regulation and transparency.</p>
<p>The SEC&#8217;s ongoing enforcement actions and his steadfast commitment to mandatory disclosure signal a shift toward greater scrutiny and accountability in the market.</p>
<p>The impact of Gensler&#8217;s speech and the SEC&#8217;s actions will likely be felt across the industry. Market participants may face increased pressure to comply with registration requirements and provide transparent disclosures. This could potentially lead to a more robust and trustworthy crypto ecosystem, attracting both institutional and retail investors.</p>

<title>SEC Delays Decision On Grayscale’s Ethereum ETF – Here’s The New Deadline</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/sec-delays-decision-on-grayscales-ethereum-etf-here/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/sec-delays-decision-on-grayscales-ethereum-etf-here/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。美国证券交易委员会（SEC）再次延长了 Grayscale 的以太坊期货信托交易所交易基金（ETF）的决定期限。该决定被延迟至5月30日，以便“有足够的时间考虑提出的规则变更”。有分析师认为 Grayscale 的以太坊期货 ETF 申请可能是为了通过获批其现货 ETH 交易所交易产品。此外，由于SEC对加密公司发出传票并未积极与ETF发行人沟通，使得以太坊现货ETF的批准可能性很小。 <div>
<p>The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-ceo-predicts-sec-setback-in-ethereum-case/">United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)</a> has announced an extension &#8211; yet again &#8211; of the deadline for asset management firm Grayscale’s Ethereum Futures Trust exchange-traded fund (ETF). Initially published for comment in the Federal Register on October 3, 2023, the SEC claims to be extending the deadline to have “sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change.”</p>
<h2>Final Deadline For Grayscale’s Futures Ethereum ETF</h2>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/sro/nysearca/2024/34-99842.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">March 22 filing</a>, the SEC disclosed that it will prolong the decision-making process for Grayscale’s Ethereum Futures ETF. The commission has now moved the deadline from March 31 to May 30 to decide whether or not to approve the investment product.</p>
<p>A part of the SEC’s filing read: </p>
<blockquote><p>The Commission finds that it is appropriate to designate a longer period within which to issue an order approving or disapproving the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider the proposed rule change and the issues raised therein. Accordingly, the Commission, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,10 designates May 30, 2024, as the date by which the Commission shall either approve or disapprove the proposed rule change.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sec-delays-fidelity-spot-ethereum-etf/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">James Seyffart</a>, a Bloomberg ETF analyst, did not express surprise at this deadline extension. “There&#8217;s the delay order for Grayscale&#8217;s Ethereum Futures ETF Filing &#8212; as expected,” the analyst said in his <a href="https://x.com/JSeyff/status/1771296290149683490?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post on the X</a> platform.</p>
<p>In November, Seyffart said he believes that Grayscale’s application for an Ether Futures ETF is “nothing but a trojan horse” to get approval for its spot ETH exchange-traded product. Hence, it would be interesting to see how this latest delay influences the clearance of the spot ETH ETF, especially considering the slim odds of approval.</p>
<p>The<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sec-initiates-grayscales-spot-ethereum-etf-decision/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> SEC delayed its decision on whether to approve Grayscale’s spot Ethereum ETF</a> earlier in January while also opening the application to public comments. In the most recent development, the asset management revised its 19b-4 form in a bid to force the regulator’s hand.</p>
<h2>Approval Of ETH Spot ETF Seems Very Unlikely: Alex Thorn</h2>
<p>Alex Thorn, Galaxy Digital’s head of research, has <a href="https://www.galaxy.com/insights/research/top-stories-of-the-week-3-22-24/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">said</a> the approval of the Ethereum spot ETFs is looking very unlikely at the moment. This reasoning is based on the SEC’s subpoena of crypto firms and lack of engagement with potential ETF issuers.</p>
<p>According to a recent report, the SEC sent subpoenas to various crypto companies regarding their relationships with the Ethereum Foundation. </p>

<p>Thorn posits that the SEC could be investigating whether the original Ethereum ICO (Initial Coin Offering) was an unregistered securities offering rather than <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-in-the-hot-seat-sec-security-label-looms/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">classifying the secondary trading of Ether today as securities trading</a>.</p>
<p>The analyst mentioned that it is unclear how this probe alone hurts the chance of ETH ETF approval. However, he believes that when this is combined with the fact that the SEC is not actively communicating with applicants, the authorization of the ETFs in May seems very unlikely.</p>

<title>Crypto Pundit Predicts Massive Price Surge For Dogecoin – Here’s The Target</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-pundit-predicts-price-surge-for-dogecoin/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-pundit-predicts-price-surge-for-dogecoin/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。加密分析师DonAlt提出了对主要的狗狗币的看涨观点，表示DOGE有可能达到1美元。他认为DOGE是他关注的资产之一，并建议0.1美元是一个良好的入场点。此外，他认为DOGE比比特币更有投资价值。另一位分析师预测狗狗币的主要竞争对手狗狗币和Shiba Inu也有望实现显著涨幅，可能创下新的历史最高纪录。这些预测再次突显了这些加密货币之间的竞争。Shiba Inu在今年初已经取得了超过160%的涨幅，比狗狗币的80%更高。 <div>
<p>Crypto analyst DonAlt has provided a bullish narrative for the foremost meme coin, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/big-money-eyes-dogecoin-whale-activity-explodes-600/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Dogecoin (DOGE)</a>. This follows his recent statement suggesting that DOGE could still <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-too-much-firepower/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">move over 500%</a> from its current price levels. </p>
<h2><b>Dogecoin Could Rise To $1</b></h2>
<p>DonAlt mentioned in a video on his YouTube channel that DOGE “it isn’t too unlikely for Dogecoin to go to $1.” This raises the possibility of the meme coin breaking its all-time high (ATH) of $0.7376 on its road to $1, which no doubt presents <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-10-largest-meme-coin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">mouth-watering gains for investors</a>. </p>

<p>The crypto analyst made this statement while revealing that Dogecoin was <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/altcoin/dogecoin-shiba-inu-pepe-explode/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">one of the altcoins</a> he had his eyes on. He added that he found the meme coin “interesting” because it dipped back into support on the PTC chart. Meanwhile, DonAlt suggested that $0.1 is a good entry point for those looking to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-when-dogecoin-does-this/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">invest in DOGE</a> and stated that he will probably buy if it drops to that level. </p>
<p>The crypto analyst remarked that he would also look to Bitcoin’s price movement to determine whether or not to buy Dogecoin now. If Bitcoin confirms a bullish sentiment, he will buy the meme coin at whatever price level he finds it at since it is still a long way from hitting $1. </p>
<p>Interestingly, the crypto analyst suggested that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-coinbase-futures-listing/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">DOGE</a> was a better investment than Bitcoin. He stated that DOGE could trade as high as $2 if Bitcoin never drops back to the $60,000 range. That is why he finds investing in the meme coin more attractive than buying the flagship crypto at $60,000 and seeing it <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/bitcoin-new-ath-by-year-end/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">rise to $90,000</a>. </p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/pMXavQzo/" width="1835" /></p>

<h2><b>Shiba Inu Could Also See Significant Gains</b></h2>
<p>Crypto analyst and trader Xanrox also <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-surge-crypto-shib/#:~:text=In%20a%20recent%20analysis%2C%20Xanrox,next%20wave%20to%20the%20upside.%E2%80%9D" rel="noopener " target="_blank">recently predicted</a> that DOGE’s top contender, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-23-5-million-shiba-inu/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Shiba Inu (SHIB)</a>, could witness a price surge of over 300%. This also means that SHIB, like DOGE, could hit a new ATH in this <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/crypto-analyst-shiba-inu-target/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">market cycle</a>. Meanwhile, analysts like Javon Marks have also <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/crypto-analyst-shiba-inu-target/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">raised</a> the possibility of SHIB deleting another zero and rising to as high as $0.0001553. </p>
<p>These massive price predictions for DOGE and SHIB again underscore the battle between these crypto tokens to assert themselves as the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/crypto-analyst-shiba-inu-target/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">most valuable meme coin</a>. So far, they have made significant moves in the market since the beginning of the year. However, there is a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/crypto-analyst-shiba-inu-target/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">growing feeling</a> that SHIB could overtake DOGE at some point. </p>

<p>SHIB has already seen more gains since the beginning of the year, boasting a year-to-date (YTD) gain of over 160% compared to DOGE’s 80%.</p>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。文章谈到了Shiba Inu Metaverse项目顾问Marcie Jastrow被指与骗局有关。Trophias称她为“专业骗子”，而Jastrow否认了这些指控，表示她与公司之间存在知识产权纠纷。投资者对项目仍持乐观态度，但一些人对Jastrow把资源用于其他项目而不是Metaverse项目表示批评。文章指出了项目的透明度和未来发展路径的不确定性。 <div>
<p>In a recent turn of events, Marcie Jastrow, the advisor for the Shiba Inu Metaverse project, has found herself at the center of controversy surrounding allegations of scam affiliation.</p>
<p>The accusations surfaced after Jastrow dissociated herself from a company and removed any trace of her association with it on her LinkedIn account. Trophias, a former member of the SHIB Defense Breed, went as far as labeling Jastrow a &#8220;professional scammer.&#8221;</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p></p>
<h2><strong>Jastrow&#8217;s Response</strong></h2>
<p>Jastrow swiftly responded to these allegations, vehemently denying any involvement in scams. She clarified that her decision to dissociate from the company was driven by disputes over intellectual property rights, rather than any fraudulent activities.</p>
<p>Jastrow emphasized that the situation had become a distraction, leading her to sever all ties with the company. While she did not address Trophias directly, her statement aimed to set the record straight.</p>

<p></p>
<p>However, Jastrow&#8217;s call for assistance for the Welly Friends project, which focuses on blockchain adoption in the agricultural scene, drew criticism from some quarters.</p>
<p>Detractors argued that she should prioritize the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Shiba Inu</a> Metaverse project instead. The conflicting opinions regarding Jastrow&#8217;s priorities and resource allocation have further fueled the ongoing debate.</p>

<h2><strong>Shiba Inu Metaverse Scrutiny</strong></h2>

Trophias&#8217; accusations have raised questions about the project&#8217;s integrity, but without concrete evidence, it is difficult to ascertain the veracity of the claims.</p>
<p>The ongoing dispute over intellectual property rights adds another layer of complexity to the situation. While Jastrow has clarified her stance, the lack of transparency surrounding the specifics of the dispute leaves room for speculation.

<title>Do Kwon To Be Released From Prison But Remanded To Montenegro – Details</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/do-kwon-released-from-prison-remanded-to-montenegro/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/do-kwon-released-from-prison-remanded-to-montenegro/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。Terraform Labs联合创始人Do Kwon被发现在黑山持有伪造文件并被捕。他因涉嫌在2022年Terra生态系统崩溃中欺诈用户50亿美元而被韩国通缉。尽管他在黑山服刑，但最高法院暂停了他被引渡到韩国的决定，以评估下级法院审查程序是否存在违规。这可能会延迟引渡程序。 <div>
<p>Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon is now set to be released from prison in Montenegro; however, the South Korean will remain restricted to the borders of the European nation pending a fixed date for his extradition to his home country. </p>

<h2>Do Kwon Serves Time In Montenegro, Awaits Extradition Decision</h2>
<p>In March 2023, Do Kwon, alongside former Terraform CFO Han Chang-joon, was apprehended by local authorities in Montenegro for traveling with falsified documents. This development came as the crypto mogul was wanted by legal authorities <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sec-sue-terraform-labs/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">in the US</a> and South Korea for crimes of fraud following the crash of the prominent Terra ecosystem in 2022, which wiped out over $50 billion of users&#8217; funds. </p>
<p>Do Kwon was given a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/court-denies-do-kwon-appeal-upholds-jail-sentence/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">four-month sentence</a> in Montenegro for using a fake passport which eventually commenced in November 2023. According to<a href="https://www.vijesti.me/vijesti/crna-hronika/699353/do-kvona-pustaju-iz-zatvora-ali-ne-smije-da-napusti-crnu-goru" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> local media Vijesti,</a> this prison time has been served with the South Korean citizen set to be released on March 23, 2024. </p>
<p>However, an order from the High Court of Podgorica directing the seizure of Do Kwon’s valid travel documents will prevent the wanted crypto figure from leaving Montenegrin borders for the time being. This is quite unsurprising as Do Kwon is expected to be extradited to South Korea to face fraud allegations for his involvement in the Terra blockchain project.</p>
<p>The Asian nation had initially contested with the US for the custody of the former Terraform boss, with both parties filing extradition requests following Do Kwon’s arrest in Montenegro. After a series of court proceedings over the last few months, South Korea <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/montenegro-orders-do-kwon-extradition-to-s-korea/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">finally secured</a> the custody of the Terra Luna founder on the basis of filing an extradition request earlier than the US. However, recent developments reveal the extradition process may be stalled for the time being.</p>

<h2>Montenegro&#8217;s Apex Court Postpones Do Kwon’s Extradition Indefinitely </h2>
<p>In an unexpected turnout, the Supreme Court of Montenegro <a href="https://sudovi.me/vrhs/sadrzaj/ONBM" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">has ordered</a> a halt to the extradition of Do Kwon to South Korea pending its decision on a petition from the national prosecutors&#8217; office. </p>
<p>On March 20, the Supreme State Prosecutor’s Office of Montenegro filed a request for protection of legality regarding the decision on the extradition request process by a lower court. The prosecutors argued there were procedural errors in the handling of the case by the appellate court. </p>
<p>Specifically, the prosecutors believe that the appellate court acted beyond its authority by rejecting an appeal from Kwon&#8217;s legal team, asserting that only Montenegro&#8217;s Supreme Court has the jurisdiction to make such legal decisions. Therefore, the Council of the Supreme Court will evaluate whether there were indeed procedural violations and whether the lower court&#8217;s decision regarding Kwon&#8217;s extradition was legally sound, which will determine if the approved transfer will follow through.</p>

<title>Solana Meme Coin Mania Breaks Records: DEX Volume Surges, Yet Failed Transactions Hit 72%</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/solana-meme-coin-mania-breaks-records/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/solana-meme-coin-mania-breaks-records/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。Solana（SOL）和其基于的meme币经历了惊人的增长，其中SOL的YTD增长率达到652%。然而，meme币的激增也给网络带来了挑战，包括交易失败、交易费用上涨以及机器人活动的盛行。此外，文章还介绍了Solana与以太坊（ETH）的竞争以及投资者对Solana的持续兴趣。当前SOL的价格为171.80美元，并且在过去7天中持续下跌。 <div>
<p>Solana (SOL) has experienced an exceptional uptrend, with a staggering year-to-date (YTD) surge of 652%. However, the recent surge in meme coins has further amplified the blockchain&#8217;s growth narrative. </p>
<p>Solana-based tokens such as dogfight (WIF), Bonk Inu (BONK), and Boof of Meme (BOME) have witnessed remarkable growth rates of 574%, 3200%, and 49%, respectively, according to CoinGecko <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/solana-meme-coins" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">data</a>. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, this unprecedented meme coin mania has its fair share of ramifications, including increased transaction failures, rising transaction fees, and the dominance of bot-driven activities.</p>
<h2>Meme Coin Ecosystem Faces Challenges</h2>
<p>The surge in meme coin popularity is evident through the rise in decentralized exchange (DEX) and meme coin volume on Solana. On March 16th, major meme coins like BONK, WIF, TREMP, BODEN, and BOME recorded a cumulative volume of $1.33 billion. </p>
<p>This surge in <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-defi-tvl-rockets-80-impact-on-sol-price/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">trading activity</a> highlights investors&#8217; significant interest and participation in the Solana meme coin ecosystem.</p>
<p>However, the influx of bots seeking to exploit potential opportunities has resulted in a notable increase in failed transactions within the Solana network. </p>

<p>On-chain researcher and analyst Tom Wan <a href="https://x.com/tomwanhh/status/1770513464659735019?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reveals </a>that 72% of the failed transactions can be attributed to bot activities. Although this high failure rate has impacted the network&#8217;s efficiency, the effect on organic users has been relatively less severe than bots.</p>
<img alt="Solana" class="size-large wp-image-288987" height="366" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GJIcI1lWoAA5imc.jpeg?w=980&#038;resize=980%2C366" width="980" />
<p>However, as the meme coin frenzy continues to grip Solana, the network has witnessed a substantial increase in average transaction fees. </p>
<p>While average users can still execute transactions without paying priority fees, Tom Wan highlights that the median <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-meme-coin-trader/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">transaction fee</a> has tripled from 0.000005 SOL to 0.000016 SOL. As a result, the average transaction fee has risen to $0.065, reflecting increased demand and congestion on the network.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the surge in meme coin trading activity on Solana has brought benefits and challenges. While the DEX and meme coin volume growth signifies the increasing adoption and interest in these tokens, it has also exposed vulnerabilities within the network. </p>
<h2>Solana Surpasses All Other Blockchain Ecosystems</h2>
<p>The competition between <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-ceo-predicts-sec-setback-in-ethereum-case/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ethereum </a>(ETH) and Solana continues to intensify, as the so-called &#8220;Ethereum Killer&#8221; appears to be the latest to dominate global investor interest, outpacing other blockchain ecosystems. </p>
<p>According to recent <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/research/publications/most-popular-blockchain-ecosystems" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">research </a>by CoinGecko, Solana&#8217;s growing popularity can be attributed to its recent rally, which has propelled it to reclaim its 2021 highs. </p>
<p>This resurgence has captured the attention of investors worldwide, who are drawn to blockchain&#8217;s potential for innovation and growth. In addition, the success of notable projects within the Solana ecosystem, such as Pyth, has further boosted investor confidence and interest in the platform.</p>
<img alt="Solana" class="size-large wp-image-288986" height="318" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot_86.jpg?w=665&#038;resize=665%2C318" width="665" />
<p>While Solana has emerged as the most popular blockchain ecosystem, Ethereum holds a significant position in the industry. CoinGecko&#8217;s data reveals that Ethereum captures 12.7% of investor interest, ranking it as the second most popular ecosystem 2024. </p>
<p>According to the research, Ethereum&#8217;s continued relevance can be attributed to its well-established presence and familiarity among investors. However, attention within the Ethereum ecosystem is increasingly dispersed to layer 2 solutions built on top of the Ethereum network.</p>

<p>With a 5.4% share of investor interest year-to-date (YTD), the third most popular blockchain ecosystem is crypto exchange <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binances-4-3b-settlement-marks-crucial-shift/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Binance&#8217;s </a>BNB Smart Chain ecosystem. </p>
<img alt="Solana" class="size-large" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/b6VnbASq/" width="1815" />
<p>Currently, the price of SOL stands at $171.80, reflecting a continuation of its price correction over the past seven days, which amounts to a 5% decline. This correction has also persisted over the past 24 hours, with a further decrease of 6.6% in price.</p>

<title>Is Your Crypto Safe? Trezor Addresses Concerns Over Hack, Claims “Sophisticated Phishing Scam”</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/is-your-crypto-safe-trezor-addresses-concerns-over-hack-claims-sophisticated-phishing-scam/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/is-your-crypto-safe-trezor-addresses-concerns-over-hack-claims-sophisticated-phishing-scam/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。<br />3月19日，Trezor的社交媒体账户遭受了黑客攻击，暴露了20万关注者，引发了一场虚假加密货币预售骗局。黑客利用精心设计的网络钓鱼攻击窃取了8000美元价值的加密资产。Trezor公司表示他们的安全措施仍然牢固，而事件的发生是由于一场精心策划的网络钓鱼攻击。虽然攻击者企图进行大规模盗窃，但由于加密社区的监控和误操作的特点，被成功阻止。 <div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">On March 19, Trezor’s X suffered a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/trezor-alerts-66000-users-to-risk-of-phishing/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">security breach</a> that exposed the account’s 200,000 followers to a fake crypto presale. After the alarms were raised, most crypto users stayed vigilant while the hardware wallet company regained control.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Trezor’s team recently published a preliminary report addressing the concerns. The post also explained the elaborate phishing scam that bypassed the company’s security measures.</p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Is Trezor’s “Unwavering Security” Still Protecting Your Crypto?</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">After gaining control of the account, the hacker <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1770225097552363795?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1770225097552363795%7Ctwgr%5Ed4397b1156b69bcb1b5b5db472759fc1be8caf10%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newsbtc.com%2Fnews%2Ftrezor-x-account-hacked-how-much-was-taken-in-the-fake-crypto-presale%2F" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">posted</a> a fake presale address for a $TRZR token. Disguised as an “initiative” to help the Slerf community, the post offered a “separate bonus airdrop” from a website linked in the post that redirected to a wallet drainer.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">After Trezor regained control of the account, X users expressed their worries about the incident and suggested that the hack was a “bad look” on the security-focused company. However, the company guaranteed that they had “robust security measures.”</p>
<blockquote><p>We want to clarify that we do not make use of SMS for 2FA, and instead employ more secure methods of authentication.</p></blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The company finally <a href="https://blog.trezor.io/update-addressing-concerns-around-our-recent-x-twitter-account-breach-a888bc349007" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">addressed</a> users’ concerns in a preliminary report. The hack is possible due to a “sophisticated phishing scam” instead of a lack of basic security measures.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The company is based on “unwavering security,” the post states; as such, all products and internal systems remain unaffected despite the breach.</p>
<p><img alt="Trezor, crypto hack" class="size-large wp-image-288963 aligncenter" height="225" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Captura-de-Pantalla-2024-03-22-a-las-11.55.14-a.-m.png?w=980&#038;resize=980%2C225" width="980" /></p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Sophisticated Phishing Scam Steals Pocket Change</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">According to Trezor, the ongoing investigation has revealed that “the breach appears to have arisen from a sophisticated and calculated phishing attack that was in the works for weeks.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/over-2-6m-stolen-in-phishing-scam-involving-top-crypto-trader/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">calculated scheme</a> began on February 29 after the attacker posed for a “credible entity” from the crypto industry. At the time of writing, the identity of the impersonated figure was not revealed.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The attacker contacted Trezor’s PR team through X using a “well-crafted social media presence.” The seemingly genuine contact aimed to schedule an interview with the company’s CEO.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">According to the report, the attacker and the team had a back-and-forth conversation over several days, which made the efforts to stage a call seem more credible. However, the call agreement led to the click of the link that granted access to Trezor’s X account.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The malicious link was disguised as a Calendly invite that, upon clicking, redirected a Trezor’s team member to a page requesting the X login credentials. The team rescheduled the call as the incident raised red flags.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">During the rescheduled call, the attacker pretended to have technical issues and urged Trezor’s team member “to ‘authorize’ joining the call.” This authorization connected the hacker’s Calendly app with the company’s <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/microstrategy-x-account-hacked/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">X account</a>. As a result, the attacker gained access to the account and published the now-deleted posts.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">he got a whopping 0.96 Solana as well <a href="https://t.co/zqHjxM8EOI" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/zqHjxM8EOI</a></p>
<p>&mdash; xc (@Theft) <a href="https://twitter.com/Theft/status/1770237549547802922?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">March 19, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The hacker only stole $8,100 from the malicious link redirecting to the wallet drainer.  Impressively, just 0.96 SOL (around $162,4 at writing time’s pricing) were sent to the fake presale address.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Undoubtedly, the attack was a calculated and elaborate scheme that aimed to become a big heist. However, the hacker’s attempt was halted by the crypto community surveillance and the suspicious nature of the unauthorized posts.</p>

<title>Spot Bitcoin ETF Issuer WisdomTree Receives Approval For Crypto App Launch In New York</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/wisdomtree-receives-approval-for-crypto-app-launch/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/wisdomtree-receives-approval-for-crypto-app-launch/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。WisdomTree获得了纽约州金融服务部（NYDFS）的信托公司特许经营权，允许其提供数字资产的托管服务，并发行和交易DFS批准的稳定币。该公司计划在纽约推出数字资产应用程序，并提供金币和美元币等产品。该特许经营权使WisdomTree能够提供符合最高合规标准的数字化产品和服务。他们也计划在未来在传统金融和区块链技术领域发挥重要作用。 <div>
<p>In a significant development, spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) manager WisdomTree, <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240322928015/en/WisdomTree-Granted-Trust-Company-Charter-by-New-York-State-Department-of-Financial-Services-DFS-WisdomTree-Prime" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">has been granted</a> a trust company charter by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), marking another regulatory victory for the company following its <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/breaking-spot-bitcoin-etfs-approved-by-us-sec/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">ETF approval</a> by the US Securities and Exchange Commission on January 10. </p>
<p>This regulatory win allows the company to operate as a limited-purpose trust company under the New York Banking Law, clearing the path for the asset manager to launch its highly anticipated crypto app in New York.</p>
<h2>WisdomTree Receives NYDFS Trust Company Charter</h2>
<p>The NYDFS trust company charter authorizes WisdomTree to provide fiduciary custody services for digital assets, including digital wallet services. The firm is also authorized to issue and exchange DFS-approved stablecoins and manage <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/wisdomtree-files-for-an-ethereum-etf-with-the-sec/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">stablecoin reserves</a>. </p>

<p>Jonathan Steinberg, the Founder and CEO of WisdomTree, expressed the significance of the NYDFS approval, stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>The New York State Department of Financial Services is the premier regulator for businesses that engage in digital asset activity. This well-established trust company charter program – which long predates digital assets – is based on bank-grade regulation, allowing us to offer products that capitalize on innovation without sacrificing customer protection. </p></blockquote>
<p>Steinberg further emphasized that this approval not only positions the company to participate in New York&#8217;s “rapidly growing” <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/these-new-spot-bitcoin-etfs-now-hold-nearly-of-btc/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">digital asset marketplace</a> but also equips the asset manager to lead the industry&#8217;s evolution in the future.</p>
<h2>Tokenized Gold And Dollar Assets</h2>
<p>According to the announcement, under the umbrella of WisdomTree Prime, the firm&#8217;s digital trust will initially offer products to customers. These include the Gold Token and the WisdomTree Dollar Token, which will be available within the Prime ecosystem. </p>
<p>The company will also maintain reserves for these assets under the framework approved by the NYDFS. Furthermore, the trust company charter enables WisdomTree to provide New York retail <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/evaluating-performance-bitcoin-etfs-since-launch/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">customers </a>with access to WisdomTree Prime, which is expected to be available in the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Will Peck, Head of Digital Assets at WisdomTree and CEO of WisdomTree Digital Trust Company, LLC, highlighted the compliance standards upheld by the company, stating: </p>
<blockquote><p>Held to the highest compliance standards in the industry, a New York limited-purpose trust company provides the leading platform to offer regulated tokenized products and services to WisdomTree&#8217;s retail and institutional customers. </p></blockquote>
<p>WisdomTree&#8217;s grant of the trust company charter by the NYDFS signifies a significant step forward in its mission to provide new and regulated financial services in the digital asset space. </p>
<p>With the imminent launch of its <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etf-these-9-new-participants-accumulated/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">crypto app</a>, the digital asset manager aims to play a pivotal role at the intersection of traditional finance and blockchain technology, improving access to digital assets for retail and institutional clients.</p>

<title>Will Shiba Inu Outperform Dogecoin In 2024 As The Top Meme Coin?</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-outperform-dogecoin/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-outperform-dogecoin/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章比较了2024年狗狗币和SHIB狗狗币的价格表现，指出SHIB在年初表现更出色。虽然SHIB价格波动更大，但仍在竞争中处于领先地位。SHIB利用狗狗币的影响力，也通过市场推广成功吸引关注。两者之间的竞争仍在继续，SHIB试图取代狗狗币。目前，狗狗币的市值为228亿美元，领先于SHIB的160亿美元。 <div>
<p class="p2">As the crypto bull market rolls around once more, top meme coins Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have started vying for the position of best performer once again. The year 2024, despite only being three months in, has already been incredibly interesting in this regard as both <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-23-5-million-shiba-inu/">meme coins</a> rally to new yearly highs.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Dogecoin Vs. Shiba Inu Price Performance</h2>
<p class="p2">Taking the year 2024 into account, it seems that Shiba Inu is finally winning the top <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-coinbase-futures-listing/">meme coin</a> battle against Dogecoin. A comparison of prices at the start of the year and now shows that Dogecoin has performed poorly compared to Shiba Inu.</p>

<p class="p2">To put this in perspective, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-23-5-million-shiba-inu/">Shiba Inu price</a> started out the year around $0.000009 and then surged more than 400% in March to $0.000044. The price has since retraced since this and returned to the $0.000027 level where it is currently trading now, still a more than 150% increase from where it started the year.</p>
<p class="p2">In comparison, the Dogecoin price started 2024 at around $0.08 and then rallied to $0.2 in March. This is less than a 300% increase in the same time period in comparison to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-latest-shib-magazine/">SHIB</a>. Then, just like SHIB, the DOGE price has retraced some of its gains and is now trading at $0.15, which is around a 100% increase from where it began the year.</p>
<p class="p2">However, when it comes to holding up during a downtrend, DOGE has proven to be the better performer. This is because while Shiba Inu has seen its price fall around 50% from its March highs, the DOGE price has only seen a 25% decline. This suggests that Shiba Inu is the much more volatile option, thus making it more likely to move up faster than Dogecoin. But it also means that the price of SHIB is more likely to crash rapidly compared to the more stable DOGE.</p>
<h2 class="p2">The Rivalry Between SHIB And DOGE</h2>
<p class="p2">The rivalry between Shiba Inu and Dogecoin goes right back to the launch of SHIB in 2020. SHIB adopted the Shiba Inu dog which is the face of Dogecoin, and after the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-shiba-inu-updates/">DOGE price</a> rallied in 2021 due to billionaire Elon Musk’s influencer, SHIB’s position as the “Dogecoin killer” became more prominent.</p>
<p class="p2">This piggybacking of the already popular Shiba Inu dog breed made popular by <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-when-dogecoin-does-this/">DOGE</a>, as well as a very clever marketing campaign of sending half the total supply to Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, who proceeded to burn the majority of it, propelled the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-23-5-million-shiba-inu/">SHIB</a> price and brought it into the limelight.</p>

<p class="p2">Even now, this rivalry continues to wax stronger, with the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-latest-shib-magazine/">Shiba Inu team</a> threatening to dethrone Dogecoin as the leading meme coin. In an X post, the Shiba Inu team <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-shiba-inu-updates/">boasted</a> that the end was close for Dogecoin. The post hinted at major updates coming for the SHIB ecosystem that will help to solidify its position as the leading meme coin.</p>
<p class="p2">Nevertheless, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-coinbase-futures-listing/">Dogecoin remains the leading meme coin</a> for now with a market cap of $22.8 billion. This puts it ahead of Shiba Inu which is the second-largest meme coin with a market cap of $16 billion.</p>

<title>Big Money Eyes Dogecoin: Whale Activity Explodes 600%</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/big-money-eyes-dogecoin-whale-activity-explodes-600/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/big-money-eyes-dogecoin-whale-activity-explodes-600/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。最近一个月，Dogecoin区块链上的鲸鱼相关活动出现了急剧增长，鲸鱼交易数量增加了600%。这表明大额交易者对这种狗狗币的兴趣很高。这种活动可能导致价格波动，但方向无法确定。当前Dogecoin价格在0.15美元左右，过去一周下跌超过6%。 <div>
<p>On-chain data shows whale-related activity on the Dogecoin blockchain has registered a sharp 600% increase over the past month.</p>
<h2>Dogecoin Whale Transactions Have Exploded In The Last Month</h2>
<p>According to data from the market intelligence platform <a href="https://twitter.com/intotheblock/status/1770791562793914393" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">IntoTheBlock</a>, DOGE whales have become quite active recently. The on-chain indicator of interest here is the Transaction Count of transfers on the Dogecoin blockchain with a value of at least $1 million.</p>
<p>Generally, only the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/1-5-billion-bitcoin-leaves-coinbase-bullish-signal/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">whale</a> entities are capable of moving such large amounts with single transactions, so these transactions are attributed to involving these humongous investors.</p>

<p>As such, the total number of transactions taking place on the network every day that are of a size falling in this range can provide us with hints about the behavior of the whales.</p>
<p>When the value of the Transaction Count of moves of this size is high, the whales actively participate in the network. Such a trend implies that interest around the memecoin may be high among these large traders.</p>
<p>On the other hand, low values of the indicator suggest not many large transactions are happening on the blockchain, a potential indication that the whales aren&#8217;t paying attention to the cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Dogecoin Transaction Count for the whales over the past month:</p>
<p><img alt="Dogecoin Whale Transaction Count" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="432" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GJMb0xXW4AAcExa?format=jpg&amp;name=large" width="1690" /></p>

<p>As the above graph shows, this Dogecoin indicator has recently registered a sharp uptrend. &#8220;The number of DOGE transactions larger than $1 million increased by more than 600% in the last 30 days!&#8221; notes IntoTheBlock.</p>
<p>The analytics firm has also shared a zoomed-out view of the chart for the same metric, which puts into perspective the scale of the recent DOGE whale activity.</p>
<p><img alt="Dogecoin Activity" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="283" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GJMdXqCWoAE8hV2?format=jpg&amp;name=large" width="1685" /></p>

<p>It would appear that the recent levels of the Transaction Count of the Dogecoin whales have been the highest that the network has witnessed since May 2021, when DOGE hit its <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-supply-in-profit-nears-95-top-signal/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">top</a>.</p>
<p>What does the high whale activity mean for the memecoin&#8217;s price? Generally, it&#8217;s hard to say anything about a price outcome based on the Transaction Count of these humongous entities alone, given that both selling and buying transfers count equally in the metric.</p>
<p>What the indicator&#8217;s trend can say, though, is whether the asset is likely to see more <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-exchange-outflows-inflows-highs-volatility/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">volatility</a> in the near future. A large number of whale transactions means a significant shift of volume in the market, which can naturally produce some noticeable fluctuations in the price.</p>

<p>As Dogecoin has been going through high whale activity recently, it may see more volatile price action soon, should whales continue to remain active. However, the direction of this volatility can theoretically take the memecoin in either direction.</p>
<h2>DOGE Price</h2>
<p>When writing, Dogecoin is floating around the $0.15 mark, down more than 6% over the past week.</p>

<title>Shiba Inu To The Moon: Crypto Analyst Predicts 300% Surge For SHIB</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-surge-crypto-shib/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-surge-crypto-shib/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。Pseudonymous预测今年将发生显著价格飙升，提供了投资者在交易中获利的机会。他认为Shiba Inu可能在年底前涨幅达到300%，建议在0.00002249的水平作为入场点。分析人员预测SHIB可能在7月达到新的历史最高水平，并可能继续上涨。当前SHIB的价格为$0.00002794。 <div>
<p>Pseudonymous <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/crypto-expert-bitcoin-500000/#:~:text=Bullish%20Sentiment%20Shows%20Bitcoin%20Can%20Reach%20%24500%2C000&amp;text=On%20the%20road%20to%20%24500%2C000,BTC%20corrects%2020%25%20or%20more." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">crypto analyst and trader Xanrox</a> has predicted a significant price surge that could happen for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-23-5-million-shiba-inu/">Shiba Inu (SHIB)</a> this year. The crypto trader also provided an opportunity for investors to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-investing-meme-coins/">profit from this move</a>, as he stated an entry point for those interested in getting on the trade. </p>
<h2>Shiba Inu To See A 300% Gain Before Year-end</h2>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/chart/SHIBUSDT/BzRa6PlA-SHIBA-Buy-here-do-not-miss-next-pump-HUGE/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">recent analysis</a>, Xanrox expressed his bullishness on SHIB and stated that the “next profit target is 300% away.” He further asserted that the meme coin would “definitely go higher later this year” and that what was important was to catch the “bounce and ride the next wave to the upside.”</p>

<p>Looking at SHIB’s chart, the crypto analyst noted that the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-161800-target-fibonacci-elliott-wave-theory/">0.618 Fibonacci retracement</a> at 0.00002249 looks like a great level to invest in the crypto token. He added that an <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/can-elliott-waves-really-predict-price-bitcoin/">Elliot Wave technical analysis</a> is also important for such big moves to get an idea of the full picture. That way, one can see the “full market structure and map of the uptrend.” </p>
<p>Therefore, Xanrox suggested that investors wait for a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/xrp/xrp-bull-run-bull-flag-formed/#:~:text=XRP%20Bull%20Run%20Confirmed%3A%20Largest%20Bull%20Flag%20In%20Crypto%20History%20Just%20Formed,-by%20Scott%20Matherson&amp;text=XRP%20could%20well%20be%20on,this%20is%20on%20the%20horizon." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">bullish flag</a> or pattern or simply set their limit order to buy SHIB lower. This bullish pattern seemed to form not long after as the crypto trader provided further updates in his analysis, noting that SHIB only had one resistance on the way, and that level was at its current all-time high (ATH) of $0.00008845. </p>
<p>As part of his update, Xanrox also mentioned an entry point for those looking to benefit from this move to the upside. He directed <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-top-5-private-holders/">investors</a> to load up their coins at 0.0000212995, suggesting that the 300% move would start from there.</p>
<h2>Shiba Inu Could Hit New ATH By July</h2>
<p>From the accompanying chart Xanrox shared, he hinted at SHIB rising to as high as $0.00008854 by July. That would see the meme coin <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-dogecoin-shib-excitement/">set a new ATH</a> with its current ATH at $0.00008845. SHIB&#8217;s rise to that price level might just be the beginning of its run in this market cycle, as other analysts have predicted that the meme coin could delete another zero.</p>

<p>One of these analysts is Javon Marks, who <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/crypto-analyst-shiba-inu-target/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">predicts</a> that SHIB hitting the $0.000081 price range could set the stage for a further rise to $0.0001553. In the meantime, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-active-addresses-soar-over-170/">SHIB investors</a> will have their eyes on <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-price-surge-0-000052/">crypto analyst Ali Martinez’s prediction</a> that the meme coin could rise to $0.000052. </p>
<p>At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.00002794, up over 3% in the last 24 hours according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/shiba-inu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">data</a> from CoinMarketCap.</p>

<title>Chainlink Flips Cardano To Become #1 Crypto In This Metric</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/chainlink-flips-cardano-to-become-1-crypto-metric/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/chainlink-flips-cardano-to-become-1-crypto-metric/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。据数据显示，Chainlink（LINK）已超过Cardano（ADA），成为加密货币项目中的王者。根据开发活动指标，Chainlink目前是开发活动最多的加密货币项目。开发活动指标跟踪开发人员在项目的GitHub存储库上的工作量。Chainlink在过去30天内观察到超过451个事件，超过了ADA的445个事件。开发活动增加通常表明项目的开发人员对项目有承诺。虽然Chainlink的开发活动排名提升，但与价格并无直接关联。当前Chainlink的价格约为18美元，过去一周下跌了7%。 <div>
<p>Data shows that Chainlink (LINK) has surpassed Cardano (ADA) in becoming the king of cryptocurrency projects in this metric.</p>
<h2>Chainlink Is Now Top Of The Sector In Development Activity</h2>
<p>In a new post on X, the analytics firm <a href="https://twitter.com/santimentfeed/status/1770889841578012944" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Santiment</a> has shared the latest ranking for various cryptocurrency projects based on the criterion of &#8220;<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/internet-computer-icp-breaks-dev-activity-top-mean/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">development activity</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>This metric keeps track of the total work the developers of any given coin have been doing on the project&#8217;s public GitHub repository.</p>

<p>To measure this work, Santiment&#8217;s indicator uses the concept of &#8220;events.&#8221; An event refers to the developer&#8217;s action on the cryptocurrency&#8217;s repository.</p>
<p>These events aren&#8217;t the same as &#8220;commits,&#8221; which are records of changes made to the repo&#8217;s code. The analytics firm has chosen this methodology rather than simply measuring the number of GitHub commits themselves because the latter can sometimes prove to be inaccurate.</p>
<p>This is because when a project is forked (that is, a clone of it is created up to a certain point), the commits of the original project are inherited by the newer one. These commits, though, are not proof of the work done by the fork&#8217;s developers.</p>
<p>Events circumvent this issue by counting the forking as a whole as just a single event, with the events of the past project not carrying over, thus providing a truer picture of the developer&#8217;s work.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our platform pulls notable GitHub activity from project repositories via a back-tested process to ensure only the team&#8217;s significant efforts to innovate and improve are included,&#8221; notes Santiment.</p>
<p>Now, here is a table that shows how the top 10 projects are looking like right now based on their respective development activities over the past 30 days:</p>
<p><img alt="Chainlink Vs Cardano Development Activity" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="1600" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GJN0fyjbsAAALzp?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096" width="2368" /></p>

<p>As is visible above, Chainlink has improved its standing and has surpassed <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-1800-price-explosion-12/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Cardano</a> to become the top asset in this metric. The gap between the two, though, isn&#8217;t that much currently, as LINK has seen over 451 events in the past 30 days, while ADA has observed almost 445.</p>
<p>Polkadot (DOT) and Kusama (KSM), who used to be at the top fighting with ADA for the first position, appear to have fallen off, as they are now sixth and seventh, respectively.</p>
<p>Ethereum (ETH), the second-largest cryptocurrency based on market cap, has also improved its development activity rank this month, though it&#8217;s still just the ninth-placed asset in this metric.</p>
<p>As for what Chainlink&#8217;s surge to the top of the development activity list might mean, the answer is that it usually doesn&#8217;t directly correlate to the price.</p>

<p>What it shows, however, is that the developers of the project are committed to it, which can be one of the signs to look for when estimating whether a project will be around in the long term or not.</p>
<h2>LINK Price</h2>
<p>When writing, Chainlink is trading around $18, down 7% over the past week.</p>

<title>Renowned Finance Author Reveals Why You Should Buy As Much Bitcoin As You Can</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/buy-much-bitcoin-as-you-can/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/buy-much-bitcoin-as-you-can/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章从作者基于Real Asset的建议开始，强调了投资者应该集中精力积累比特币。作者批评了中国政府为了稳定经济而购买股票的做法，并建议投资者在当前经济不适宜传统投资的情况下，将重点转向黄金、白银和比特币。另外，文章指出了比特币稀缺性的优势，作者称赞比特币为一种独特的投资机会。 <div>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/author-says-you-should-buy-bitcoin/">Robert Kiyosaki</a>, the author renowned for his best-selling book “Rich Dad Poor Dad” has identified <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/robert-kiyosaki-avocates-bitcoin-investment/">Bitcoin</a> as a real-world asset, urging investors and the broader crypto community to shift their focus from stock investments and prioritize accumulating Bitcoin. </p>
<h2>Buy More Bitcoin Before It’s Too Late</h2>
<p>In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, Kiyosaki <a href="https://x.com/therealkiyosaki/status/1770591463895691390?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">advised</a> investors to focus on stacking up more Bitcoin now more than ever. Citing the dilemma <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/china-bitcoin-ban-backfires-86b-crypto-volume-soars/">China’s stock market</a> currently faces, the finance expert has suggested that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/robert-kiyosaki-safeguard-your-wealth-with-bitcoin/">investors seize the opportunity to buy as much Bitcoin</a> as they can afford before “the biggest bubble in history goes bust.”</p>

<p>Kiyosaki has claimed that China is in “trouble” because the government had borrowed funds to buy more stocks to potentially <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-expert-forecasts-us-stock-market-bitcoin/">inflate the stock market</a> artificially and stabilize the country’s economic challenges. The finance author criticized China’s decision, labeling it as a “Foolish” and “Desperate” attempt. </p>
<p>According to the author, the problem’s root lies in a global decline in consumer spending. He advised against investing in stocks and bonds at this pivotal time, <a href="https://x.com/therealkiyosaki/status/1767054547942580480?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">arguing</a> that the stock market was <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/r-kiyosaki-reiterates-bitcoin-potential-amid-greatest-crash-warning/">set to crash</a> and the current economic situation was not conducive for traditional investments.</p>
<p>Instead, he recommends investing in real assets such as gold, silver and Bitcoin, which are historically <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-will-bloom-in-higher-inflation-environment/">considered safe havens</a> in times of economic uncertainty. </p>
<p>Supporting the declaration to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-this-is-the-best-time-to-buy-btc/">buy more BTC</a>, popular crypto analyst and BTC enthusiast, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-pundit-issues-bold-declaration/">Michael van de Poppe</a> agreed to Kiyosaki’s advice, albeit with a time limit of two years. Poppe <a href="https://x.com/cryptomichnl/status/1770592410277441603?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">revealed</a> that following the anticipated crypto bubble, typically debt collapses and liquidity flows back into the dollar and other fiat currencies.</p>
<p>This scenario often leads to a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/why-the-philippines-is-embracing-cryptocurrency/">currency devaluation</a> and a subsequent rise in the stock market. He suggests that investors capitalize on <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/founder-btc-bitcoin-bull-run-just-getting-started/">Bitcoin’s current bullish momentum</a> by acquiring more of the cryptocurrency. However, he also underscored the value of diversifying investments into the stock market as Bitcoin’s bullish trends fade. </p>
<h2>Finance Guru Praises BTC&#8217;s Fixed Supply</h2>
<p>In another X post, Kiyosaki <a href="https://x.com/therealkiyosaki/status/1768389895649927266?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">lauded praises</a> for Bitcoin, describing the cryptocurrency as a unique investment opportunity due to its <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-supply-in-profit-nears-95-top-signal/">fixed supply</a>. As a popular Bitcoin advocate, Kiyosaki is renowned for his preference for investing in tangible assets such as gold, silver and BTC. </p>

<p>According to the finance guru, there were certain drawbacks involved in <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/gold-out-bitcoin-in-etf-investors-flock-to-btc/">investing in gold</a> and silver, noting that as the prices of these assets grow, their supply also increases. However, the reverse was the case for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-reaches-trillion-dollar-valuation-how-it-stacks-up-to-stocks-gold-more/">Bitcoin</a>, as the cryptocurrency has a predetermined maximum supply of 21 million coins. </p>
<p>This scarcity is a key factor driving Kiyosaki’s appreciation for the world’s largest cryptocurrency, as it implies that no matter how <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/crypto-fever-bitcoin-smashes-records-approaching-73000-milestone/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">high the price of Bitcoin goes</a>, the total supply will remain limited.</p>

<title>Are Spot Bitcoin ETF Buyers “Noobs” And Panic Selling?</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/spot-bitcoin-etf-noobs-panic-selling/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/spot-bitcoin-etf-noobs-panic-selling/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。文章指出，一些投资者在_spot Bitcoin ETF_市场表现得像菜鸟，当价格下跌时，他们选择赎回股份并自行保管加密货币，而不是让发行人通过其合作伙伴控制私钥。此外，Grayscale和其他发行人从他们的持仓中减少了超过7亿美元。总体而言，BTC仍然低于7万美元，面临压力。 <div>
<p>Billions have been channeled to spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) after the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gave the green light in mid-January. However, on-chain analysis indicates that some of these spot ETF investors might, after all, be less experienced than initially assumed.</p>
<h2>Spot Bitcoin ETF Investors Acting Like &#8220;Noobs&#8221;?</h2>
<p>Taking to X, Willy Woo, an on-chain analyst, <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1771016255866290577" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">shared</a> the Bitcoin Network Flows data and picked out crucial leads to suggest that some spot Bitcoin ETFs are shaken out too quickly by the market. </p>
<img alt="Bitcoin Network Flows | Source: Willy Woo on X" class="size-full wp-image-288933" height="753" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GJPoHxcbwAATgdX.jpg?resize=1024%2C753" width="1024" />
<p>In a post, Woo pointed to a $1.6 billion outflow from spot Bitcoin ETFs when prices crashed on March 5. During this dip, the network had inflows worth $1.1 billion. This outflow from spot Bitcoin ETFs and a marked influx of cash to the mainnet could mean that some investors choose to redeem and get hold of the underlying coin, explaining the capital injection. </p>

<p>Spot Bitcoin ETFs offer a simple and accessible route to Bitcoin investment. Unlike futures-based ETFs, which speculate on future prices, spot Bitcoin ETFs track the price of Bitcoin directly. This means investors can gain exposure to Bitcoin without the complexities of buying and holding the coins themselves. </p>
<p>All they need to do is purchase shares of spot Bitcoin ETFs from issuers like <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/north-koreas-eth-transfer-to-blackrock-via-tornado/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">BlackRock</a>. A specific amount of Bitcoin backs each purchase.</p>
<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/x/ixE5IevA/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Bitcoin price trending upward on the weekly chart | Source: BTCUSDT on Binance, TradingView" class="size-full" height="904" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/ixE5IevA/" width="1787" /></a>
<p>However, as on-chain data shows, by redeeming their shares when prices fell, investors choose to self-custody their coins instead of allowing the issuer, through its partners, to control their coin&#8217;s private keys. United States SEC filings show that most ETF issuers rely on Coinbase Custody as their primary custodian.</p>
<p> This regulated third party safeguards billions worth of Bitcoin backing each share of spot Bitcoin ETF in circulation.</p>
<h2>Grayscale Outflows Increasing, BTC Facing Headwinds</h2>
<p>The apparent shakeout and inflow directly into the mainnet as Woo shares appear to confirm previous studies. In a report, CoinDesk noted that a big chunk of early spot Bitcoin ETF demand was likely driven by retailers. </p>

<p>Their investigation found that the average trade size for one ETF hovered around $13,000. This finding reinforces the &#8220;retail investor&#8221; narrative. Even so, the actual purchasers of spot Bitcoin ETFs will be confirmed when made public.</p>
<img alt="Cash flowing to spot BTC ETFs slowing down | Source: Lookonchain on X" class="size-full wp-image-288935" height="768" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GJM8KfHXEAAXBLz.png?resize=1024%2C768" width="1024" />
<p>For now, there is no fresh capital going into spot Bitcoin ETFs. According to Lookonchain <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1770825301594869810" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">data</a> on March 21, Grayscale and the other issuers reduced over $700 million from their holdings. CoinMarketCap data shows that BTC remains below $70,000 and is under pressure.</p>

<title>Urgent Alert For Apple Mac Users: Your Cryptos Could Be At Risk</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/urgent-alert-apple-mac-crypto-at-risk/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/urgent-alert-apple-mac-crypto-at-risk/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。苹果M系列处理器中发现的漏洞可能会对加密货币用户产生严重影响，可能危及加密数字资产的安全。漏洞源于芯片的数据内存相关预取器，可泄露在加密操作中使用的秘钥。攻击方法称为“GoFetch”，不需要管理访问权限，可能导致秘钥被泄露。漏洞导致传统加密协议和抗量子计算攻击的算法受到影响。苹果尚未公开回应这一发现，建议用户密切关注解决这一漏洞的软件更新。加密社区面临不确定性和风险。 <div>
<p>A newly identified vulnerability in Apple&#8217;s M-series processors could have dire implications for crypto users, with the potential to compromise the private keys essential for securing digital assets. This flaw, which resides deep within the microarchitecture of these chips, was first <a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/03/hackers-can-extract-secret-encryption-keys-from-apples-mac-chips/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reported</a> by Ars Technica and detailed in a paper published by a collective of researchers from top US universities.</p>
<h2>Mac Users Beware: This Is Crucial For Crypto Owners</h2>
<p>The vulnerability stems from a side channel in the chip&#8217;s data memory-dependent prefetcher (DMP), a mechanism designed to enhance computing efficiency. However, this feature inadvertently allows for the extraction of secret keys during cryptographic operations, a process that is fundamental to the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ledger-expose-bitcoins-private-keys-subpoena/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">security of cryptocurrencies</a> and other digital transactions.</p>
<p>&#8220;The DMP [&#8230;] uses the data values in order to make predictions [&#8230;] if a data value &#8216;looks like&#8217; a pointer, it will be treated as an &#8216;address&#8217; [&#8230;] the data from this &#8216;address&#8217; will be brought to the cache, leaking over cache side channels,&#8221; the researchers explained, underscoring the inadvertent risk posed by this hardware optimization.</p>

<p>Dubbed &#8220;GoFetch&#8221; by its discoverers, this attack method does not require administrative access, raising alarms about the ease with which bad actors could exploit this vulnerability.</p>
<p>According to the team, &#8220;We don’t care about the data value being prefetched, but the fact that the intermediate data looked like an address is visible via a cache channel and is sufficient to reveal the secret key over time.&#8221; This discovery is particularly concerning for cryptocurrency holders, as <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/what-are-private-keys-and-why-are-they-important/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">private keys</a> are the linchpin of security for digital wallets and transactions.</p>
<p>The implications of GoFetch are vast, affecting not only traditional encryption protocols but also those designed to be resistant against quantum computing attacks. This puts a wide array of cryptographic keys at risk, including RSA and Diffie-Hellman, along with post-quantum algorithms like Kyber-512 and Dilithium-2.</p>
<p>The researchers reported that &#8220;The GoFetch app requires less than an hour to extract a 2048-bit RSA key and a little over two hours to extract a 2048-bit Diffie-Hellman key,&#8221; highlighting the efficiency and danger of this attack vector.</p>

<p>Mitigation of this vulnerability poses a significant challenge due to its hardware-based nature. While software-based defenses can be developed, they often come at the cost of degraded performance, particularly on devices with older M-series chips.</p>
<p>&#8220;For developers of cryptographic software running on M1 and M2 processors [&#8230;] they will have to employ other defenses, almost all of which come with significant performance penalties,&#8221; the researchers noted, indicating a difficult road ahead for both developers and users.</p>
<p>Apple has yet to make a public statement regarding the GoFetch findings, leaving the tech community and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/macbook-crypto-users-targeted-by-malware-attack/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">crypto users</a> eagerly awaiting a response. In the meantime, the researchers advise end users to look out for software updates that specifically address this vulnerability.</p>
<p>Given the manual and slow process required to assess an implementation&#8217;s vulnerability, the crypto community is faced with a period of uncertainty and heightened risk.</p>
<p>At press time, the Bitcoin price stood at $63,396, down 5.1% in the last 24 hours.</p>

<title>Cardano Founder Charles Hoskinson Unveils Predictions For 2030</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-founder-predictions-2030/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-founder-predictions-2030/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。Cardano创始人预测未来几年计算能力将有重大突破，机器学习模型将比当前强1000倍。他指出，这将需要专用硬件和优化技术。这将使通用PC能够处理以往仅供高性能系统处理的复杂计算任务。此举将大大改善计算能力的可及性，对各行业的应用也将产生深远影响。同时，Cardano的价格预测并未提及，但其他加密货币分析师预计ADA价格将在未来数周内上涨至1.70美元，并有望突破5美元。 <div>
<p>Founder of Cardano, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-founder-declares-crypto-under-attack/">Charles Hoskinson</a> has boldly predicted a revolutionary advancement in the landscape of computational power. His forecast anticipates a remarkable leap forward in <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano/cardano-price-6-5-ath/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">machine learning capabilities</a> in the next few years.</p>
<h2>Machine Learning Breakthrough Expected By 2030</h2>
<p>In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, Hoskinson <a href="https://x.com/iohk_charles/status/1770414805788078439?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">declared</a> that by the end of the decade, it would be possible to run machine learning models 1,000 times more powerful than Mixtral on a standard gaming Personal Computer (PC). The Cardano founder’s statement implies a substantial improvement in the capabilities of handling complex computational tasks in the realm of machine learning and <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/artificial-intelligence-crypto-boom-whats-behind-the-double-digit-surge/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Artificial Intelligence (AI).</a></p>

<p>According to the crypto founder, this technological innovation will only be possible with specialized hardware and optimization techniques. By leveraging these advanced technologies, the computational power of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/the-power-of-seasonality-and-web3-in-video-gaming-a-new-era-of-engagement-and-ownership/">gaming</a> PCs is potentially set to rise to unexpected levels, enabling them to effectively handle tasks previously reserved for high-performance systems. </p>
<p>Hoskinson’s prediction ushers in a potential for improved accessibility to computational power, with its implications becoming far-reaching, as various industries would potentially benefit from its applications. The Cardano founder’s proclamation also comes at a time when <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/coinbase-ai-a-force-in-crypto-sector/">technological innovation and advancement, particularly in the fields of AI</a> and machine learning are growing rapidly. </p>
<p>In the advent that his predictions come to fruition, the boundaries of computational power would effectively be breached, driving innovation on a global scale and unlocking potential benefits that could come from harnessing immense computational power on consumer-grade hardware. </p>
<h2>Cardano Founder Excludes ADA In Projections</h2>
<p>While making his predictions for 2030, Hoskinson failed to provide any personal <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/analyst-predicts-cardano-price-to-skyrocket-by-1400/">projections on the future outlook of Cardano’s native token, ADA</a>. The crypto founder has recently been focusing on the transformative capabilities of Artificial Intelligence and machine learning models within the industry. </p>

<p>At the time of writing the price of ADA is $0.64, marking a 10.05% decline over the past week, according to CoinMarketCap. While other cryptocurrencies like <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-rallies-3550/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Ethereum (ETH)</a> and <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solana/solana-price-soars-by-11-heres-why/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Solana (SOL)</a> have experienced bullish rallies, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-price-prediction-is-ada-dead-what-are-the-better-options/">ADA has remained relatively subdued.</a></p>
<p>Although Hoskinson has not provided a price forecast for Cardano, other crypto analysts have stepped in to fill the gap. According to popular crypto analyst, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-analyst-sets-5-target-for-cardano-price-how/">Ali Martinez</a>, the price of ADA is expected to reach $1.70 following a period of consolidation between the range of $0.55 to $0.80 in the upcoming weeks.</p>
<p>The crypto analyst has predicted that after the upswing to $1.70, Cardano could experience a significant breakout to $5. This surge would <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano/cardano-ada-eyes-explosive-2000-bull-run-targeting-12-and-quadrupling-ath/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">surpass the cryptocurrency’s previous all-time high</a> of $3.10 in 2021.</p>

<title>EU Parliament Outlaws Anonymous Crypto Payments: Details</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/eu-outlaws-anonymous-crypto-payments-details/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/eu-outlaws-anonymous-crypto-payments-details/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。欧盟议会的主要委员会通过了一项新的立法举措，禁止匿名加密货币支付，引发了激烈的争论和批评。新的立法要求对商业交易中的匿名现金支付进行限制，以及对数字货币支付的追踪和监管。批评者认为这些措施侵犯了个人隐私和自由，同时挑战了法规的有效性和可执行性。加密货币社区对这些新规定做出了批评，指出了对捐赠和货币使用的潜在影响。对于这些规定的实施挑战在于加密货币的去中心化和边境化性质，可能会限制欧盟的监管努力。 <div>
<p>The majority of the EU Parliament’s lead committees approved a new legislative move to ban anonymous crypto payments has ignited a firestorm of debate, marking a pivotal moment in the regulation of digital currencies within the bloc. This comprehensive package of anti-money laundering measures, extending beyond cryptocurrencies to include significant restrictions on cash transactions, represents one of the most assertive regulatory efforts seen in the global financial landscape.</p>
<h2>The Legislative Framework</h2>
<p>Under the new legislation, anonymous cash payments in commercial transactions are limited to amounts under €3,000, with a complete prohibition on cash transactions exceeding €10,000 in business contexts. The legislation casts a wide net over digital financial transactions as well, specifically targeting <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-explores-privacy-pool-system/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">anonymity in crypto</a> payments.</p>
<p>Any transaction involving cryptocurrencies to wallets managed by service providers, known as “<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/regulation-amendments-by-uk-treasury-drops-kyc-restriction-for-non-hosted-wallets/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">hosted wallets</a>,” is now required to be fully traceable, eliminating anonymity for even the smallest transactions.</p>
<p>The EU&#8217;s legislative bodies assert that these measures are critical in the fight against money laundering, financing of terrorism, and tax evasion. However, the sweeping nature of these laws has raised serious concerns about privacy rights and the fundamental freedoms of EU citizens.</p>
<p>MEP Dr. Patrick Breyer of the Pirate Party, a staunch critic of the legislation, has termed the EU&#8217;s approach as &#8220;financial paternalism.&#8221; In a detailed blog post, Breyer vehemently opposes the outright ban on anonymous payments, arguing it does little to curb crime while significantly infringing on personal liberties.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">EU Committee approves:
<img alt="🚫" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f6ab.png" style="height: 1em;" />Prohibition of cash payments over €10,000
<img alt="🆔" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f194.png" style="height: 1em;" />Prohibition of anonymous cash payments over €3,000
₿ Prohibition of anonymous crypto payments to hosted wallets without any threshold</p>
<p>This means war on cash and gradual erosion of our financial freedom!… <a href="https://t.co/gwznD4QZop" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/gwznD4QZop</a></p>
<p>— Patrick Breyer #JoinMastodon (@echo_pbreyer) <a href="https://twitter.com/echo_pbreyer/status/1770853127798861868?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">March 21, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>He asserts, &#8220;Generally prohibiting anonymous payments would at best have minimal effects on crime, but it would deprive innocent citizens of their financial freedom.&#8221; Breyer&#8217;s comments underscore a broader concern among critics that the legislation could disproportionately affect ordinary citizens under the guise of combating illegal activities.</p>

<p>Highlighting the importance of anonymity for political and social activism, Breyer points out, &#8220;The medicines or sex toys I buy is nobody’s business. To collect donations, dissidents such as the late Alexei Navalny and his wife are increasingly reliant on anonymous donations in virtual currencies worldwide.&#8221;</p>
<p>This perspective sheds light on the potential repercussions for privacy and freedom of expression, emphasizing the need for a balanced approach to regulation.</p>
<h2>Crypto Community&#8217;s Reaction</h2>
<p>The crypto sector, known for its emphasis on privacy and decentralization, has responded critically to the EU&#8217;s regulatory measures. Daniel &#8220;Loddi&#8221; Tröster, host of the Sound Money Bitcoin Podcast, <a href="https://twitter.com/18loddi/status/1771072630331785631" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">highlighted</a> the practical challenges and implications of the new laws, particularly focusing on the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-employees-bypass-kyc/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">KYC requirements</a> for transactions to hosted wallets.</p>
<p>“As KYC is required when opening accounts on the crypto exchange anyway, there are no major changes here for the time being (for most providers). However, there are restrictions in other areas. Hosted wallets are likely to include the following: Alby, blink, Wallet of Satoshi…,” he remarked.</p>

<p>These wallets have no KYC thus far. For example, the users of Wallet of Satoshi, have not yet gone through a KYC process. In future, the transfer of Sathois to this wallet would therefore require a KYC process.</p>
<p>Tröster further elaborates on the impact on donations and the broader implications for cryptocurrency use within the EU. &#8220;What initially gives me a lot more &#8216;stomach ache&#8217; are donations. Anyone who wants to donate anonymously can no longer do so with the new regulations,&#8221; he states, articulating concerns over the stifling effect these rules might have.</p>
<p>Notably, self-custody to self-custody transactions are not affected by the new law. “It may have been understood that no prevention/regulation is possible here,” Tröster stated.</p>
Enforcement Challenges
<p>Skeptics of the legislation question its effectiveness and enforceability, given the inherently decentralized and borderless nature of crypto. They argue that the global internet infrastructure and the technical capabilities of digital currencies to facilitate direct peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries could significantly hinder the EU&#8217;s regulatory efforts.</p>
<p>&#8220;Virtual Assets can technically be transferred directly from one person to another without using intermediaries, which makes them impossible to regulate,&#8221; Dr. Breyer highlights, challenging the practicality of the EU&#8217;s approach.</p>
<p>Moreover, the criticism extends to the potential overreach of the EU in attempting to regulate a global phenomenon through regional legislation. The inherent flexibility and global reach of cryptocurrencies suggest that users may find ways to circumvent these regulations, raising questions about the ultimate effectiveness of the EU&#8217;s measures.</p>
<p>At press time, Bitcoin traded at $65,957.</p>

<title>Bitcoin ETF Alert: Analyst Issues Major Warning – Brace For Impact</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etf-alert-analyst-issues-major-warning/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etf-alert-analyst-issues-major-warning/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。比特币倡导者Samson Mow相信最新的资金流出将最终逆转，并敦促加密社区“做好相应计划”。尽管担心市场情绪可能导致比特币价格下跌，Mow强调了比特币的根本驱动因素，强调其终极稀缺性和无限需求。ETF的流出引起了加密社区的担忧，但Mow认为市场情绪并非首要关注，比特币的固有特性将会取胜。他还指出，ETF的流出最终将变成流入，需要做好相应计划。 Grayscale Bitcoin Trust（GBTC）的大规模提取也导致了ETF的流出，并且SEC对以太坊的态度也引起了关注。 <div>
<p>Samson Mow, a well-known Bitcoin advocate, has expressed his belief that the latest outflows will eventually reverse, cautioning the crypto community to &#8220;plan accordingly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Responding to concerns raised about potential decreases in Bitcoin&#8217;s price due to negative market sentiment, Mow emphasized the fundamental drivers of the leading cryptocurrency, highlighting its ultimate scarcity and unlimited demand.</p>

<h2><strong>Bitcoin Will Prevail, Mow Says</strong></h2>
<p>He dismissed market sentiment as a significant concern, suggesting that Bitcoin&#8217;s intrinsic qualities will prevail.</p>
<p>Amid these developments, spot-based Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have experienced significant outflows, sparking concerns within the cryptocurrency community.</p>
<p>Over the course of just three days this week, spot ETFs witnessed staggering outflows amounting to over $700 million. BlackRock&#8217;s IBIT, the largest Bitcoin ETF, has also experienced a notable decline in daily inflows.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">All <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Bitcoin?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">#Bitcoin</a> ETF outflows will eventually become inflows. Plan accordingly.</p>
<p>— Samson Mow (@Excellion) <a href="https://twitter.com/Excellion/status/1770680394825814330?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">March 21, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Once the leader in the market, it has seen its daily inflow plummet to $49 million, marking the lowest amount recorded in the past weeks. This decline in inflows adds to the growing concerns surrounding the state of Bitcoin ETFs.</p>
<p>A key factor driving investors to exit Grayscale is the company&#8217;s higher fees when compared to its competitors in the ETF market. Lower fees offered by other providers have enticed investors away from Grayscale, leading to the substantial outflows witnessed recently.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/BSeQ7VAL/" width="2475" /></p>

<p>Experts attribute these outflows largely to a massive withdrawal of BTC from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), which has been plagued by consistent outflows ever since the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) allowed the conversion of GBTC into a spot ETF.</p>
<h2><strong>Factors Contributing To The Outflows</strong></h2>
<p>Moreover, the SEC&#8217;s approval of the launch of 10 spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 11 further contributed to the outflows. In addition to his comments on ETFs, Mow also shared his views on the potential approval of ETFs based on the Ethereum spot trading price.</p>
<p>He believes that Ethereum (ETH) should be classified as a security and expects the SEC to eventually deem it as such. He criticizes the SEC&#8217;s approval of ETH futures ETFs, considering it a significant mistake.</p>

<p>Mow&#8217;s warning regarding the potential reversal of outflows adds an element of uncertainty to the situation. As the cryptocurrency community grapples with these developments, industry experts will closely monitor the market to assess if Mow&#8217;s prediction of a reversal comes to fruition or if further challenges lie ahead.</p>
<p>While the future of Bitcoin ETFs remains uncertain, the resilience of the cryptocurrency market has been tested time and again. Investors and enthusiasts will closely keep an eye on the developments in the coming days, hoping for stability and renewed confidence in the digital asset space.</p>

<title>Ripple CEO Predicts Setback For US SEC In Ethereum Case, Similar To XRP</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-ceo-predicts-sec-setback-in-ethereum-case/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-ceo-predicts-sec-setback-in-ethereum-case/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章介绍了美国SEC与加密货币领域的法律斗争，Ripple CEO对于SEC与以太坊的法律纠纷表达了乐观的看法，预测SEC最终将败诉。文中还提及了SEC与CFTC之间的竞争，以及Ripple在与SEC的诉讼中取得的部分胜利。最终，文章指出，Ripple与SEC的长期法律纠纷即将迎来高潮，预计将于4月23日举行大审判。 <div>
<p>The legal battle between the United States <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/why-now-reasons-ethereum-probe-by-sec/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Ethereum (ETH)</a> has transformed into an intriguing case within the entire cryptocurrency landscape, with several experts predicting possible outcomes regarding the dispute.</p>
<h2>Ripple CEO Warns US SEC&#8217;s Inevitable Defeat Against Ethereum</h2>
<p>As the battle wages on, the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Ripple Labs Brad Garlinghouse, has <a href="https://x.com/bgarlinghouse/status/1770958740646502889?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">revealed</a> his optimistic insights on the case, while sharing a daring prediction in favor of the Ethereum ecosystem. His positive insights came in light of reports that the SEC is attempting to classify Ethereum &#8220;as a security&#8221; through its legal dispute with the digital asset.</p>

<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-ceo-success-for-xrp/">Brad Garlinghouse</a> has predicted that the US regulatory watchdog is most likely to &#8220;lose its war against Ethereum&#8221; &#8211; the second largest cryptocurrency asset. According to Garlinghouse, the Commission&#8217;s several &#8220;attempts to include the cryptocurrency industry in legal battles have resulted in severe court losses&#8221; over time.</p>
<p>As a result, the agency is now &#8220;lagging behind its foreign counterparts&#8221; and &#8220;competing with other regulators&#8221; such as the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).</p>
<p>The Ripple CEO then posed a question, &#8220;When would the SEC realize that it would not be able to continue fighting to categorize Ethereum as a security, as it did with XRP?&#8221;</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-coinbase-futures-listing/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Coinbase</a> submitted self-certifications with the CFTC on March 7, which could pave the way for Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Dogecoin (DOGE), and Litecoin (LTC) futures Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), if the CTFC has no complaints against it.</p>
<p>Consequently, the SEC&#8217;s prospects of overturning the &#8220;Programmatic Sales of XRP&#8221; ruling might be impacted by the categorization of these aforementioned tokens as commodities by the CFTC. This could be one of the reasons why the SEC could be fighting the CFTC.</p>
<h2>Ripple&#8217;s Partial Victories Against The SEC</h2>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-brazilian-real-stablecoin-xrp-ledger/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ripple</a> first secured a partial win in its lawsuit with the agency when Judge Analisa Torres declared in July last year that programmatic sales of XRP do not meet the requirements of the third prong of the Howey Test. Also, three months later, the SEC&#8217;s request for an interlocutory appeal against the programmatic sales order was denied by the US Judge.</p>

<p>Due to the order, the SEC will be unable to file an appeal until the conclusion of the ongoing <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-vs-sec-crucial-dates-2024/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">SEC v. Ripple lawsuit</a>. It is believed that the resolution of this dispute may have a profound impact on the US regulatory landscape and the cryptocurrency landscape as a whole.</p>
<p>The long-running legal dispute between Ripple and the US SEC began in 2020 when the Commission accused Ripple of selling XRP to US investors as an unregistered security. However, the lengthy battle is slowly approaching its climax as the grand trial is scheduled to take place by April 23.</p>

<title>Crypto In The Spotlight: Estonia Greenlights Regulation Bill</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-on-stage-estonia-okays-regulation-bill/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-on-stage-estonia-okays-regulation-bill/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。爱沙尼亚政府通过新法案，加强了加密货币服务提供商的监管，并将其纳入金融监管机构（FSA）的监管范围。这标志着爱沙尼亚对金融不端行为的强硬立场，并将爱沙尼亚的加密货币规定与欧盟框架保持一致。新法案旨在在鼓励创新的同时确保市场安全，为合法企业提供了前进的道路，并为筹集资金的公司减少了证券招股义务。爱沙尼亚借此机会成为欧盟内信誉良好的加密货币服务提供商的枢纽。 <div>
<p>Estonia, a nation long known for its embrace of digital innovation, is revamping its cryptocurrency regulations to create a more robust and transparent market. The Estonian government recently approved a bill that will significantly<a href="https://news.err.ee/1609289883/estonia-introduces-legislation-to-regulate-cryptocurrency-providers" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> increase oversight of cryptocurrency</a> service providers, bringing them under the stricter purview of the Financial Supervision Authority (FSA).</p>
<p>This shift marks a significant change from the previous system, where the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) primarily focused on Anti-Money Laundering (AML) compliance. The FSA, on the other hand, will implement a comprehensive regulatory framework, including stricter licensing requirements and the power to impose hefty fines of up to €5 million for AML violations. This move signals Estonia&#8217;s strong stance against financial malpractices within the sector.</p>

<h2><strong>Aligning With Europe: A Unified Approach</strong></h2>
<p>The new bill is not just about tightening internal controls; it also seeks to harmonize Estonian regulations with the European Union&#8217;s<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/what-is-market-in-crypto-assets-6751039#:~:text=The%20Markets%20in%20Crypto%2DAssets%20regulation%20is%20a%20European%20Union,providing%20crypto%20products%20and%20services." rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA)</a> framework. This alignment signifies Estonia&#8217;s commitment to creating a consistent approach to crypto regulation across EU member states. With MiCA set to take effect in early 2025, Estonia is taking a proactive step to ensure a smooth transition for both businesses and regulators.</p>
<h2><strong>Balancing Innovation With Security</strong></h2>
<p>Estonia has a well-deserved reputation for being crypto-friendly. In 2017, it established itself as a haven for digital currency companies by simplifying registration procedures and fostering a welcoming legal environment. However, the 2020 revocation of numerous licenses due to non-compliance highlighted the need for stricter oversight. The current bill represents a measured approach, aiming to strike a balance between encouraging innovation and safeguarding the market.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/vPxBzqLU/" width="2475" /></p>

<strong>A Safe Harbor For Crypto Businesses</strong>
<p>The Estonian government seems to be sending a clear message: innovation is welcome, but responsible conduct is paramount. The new regulations, while stricter, offer a path forward for legitimate businesses. Existing crypto firms with FIU licenses will be granted a grace period until the end of 2025 to obtain FSA licenses, providing them with ample time to adapt to the new requirements.</p>
<p>Additionally, the bill introduces a relaxed securities prospectus obligation for companies seeking to raise capital. This move aims to make it easier and more cost-effective for businesses to secure funding, potentially benefiting not just the crypto sector but also fostering the growth of the Estonian capital market as a whole.</p>

<strong>Estonia&#8217;s Potential As A Crypto Leader</strong>
<p>By strengthening its regulatory framework and aligning with EU-wide standards, Estonia is positioning itself as a leader in the European crypto landscape. This measured approach, combining innovation with robust oversight, could attract businesses seeking a secure and transparent environment to operate in. With its established digital infrastructure and a government committed to responsible regulation, Estonia has the potential to become a hub for reputable crypto service providers within the European Union.</p>

<title>Why Now? Crypto Lawyer Uncovers Reasons For Ethereum Probe By SEC</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/why-now-reasons-ethereum-probe-by-sec/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/why-now-reasons-ethereum-probe-by-sec/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。Scott Johnsson提供了关于SEC对以太坊和以太坊基金会展开调查动机的深入分析。他探讨了SEC重新评估以太坊非证券地位的动机，特别是在考虑到市场对当前分类的依赖性的情况下。文章还讨论了SEC在审批ETF时可能遇到的挑战，以及与保持一致性相关的问题。最后，文章提到了民主党参议员对暂停批准更多现货加密货币ETF的呼吁。 <div>
<p>Scott Johnsson, a finance lawyer and general partner at Van Buren Capital, provided a nuanced <a href="https://twitter.com/SGJohnsson/status/1770920022463942972" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">analysis</a> of the Securities and Exchange Commission&#8217;s (SEC) motivations for launching an investigation into Ethereum and the Ethereum Foundation. His insights, shared via X on March 22, offer a deep dive into the potential motivations for the agency to<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-in-the-hot-seat-sec-security-label-looms/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> probe the Swiss based Ethereum Foundatio</a>n.</p>
<p>Johnsson began by highlighting the profound market reliance on Ethereum&#8217;s classification as a non-security, a stance historically acknowledged by the SEC and other regulatory bodies. He stressed the importance of this classification for the functioning of various market mechanisms, stating:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Paul [Grewal, Coinbase CLO] gives a good overview on the SEC’s historical acknowledgements re: ETH non-security status. This is the current landscape that the market has relied on &#8211; including the CFTC, CME, ETFs, exchanges, and investors. Reliance interests are incredibly high.</strong></p></blockquote>
<h2>Is Thwarting The Spot Ethereum ETFs The Main Goal?</h2>
<p>A key aspect of Johnsson&#8217;s analysis revolves around the SEC&#8217;s potential motives for reconsidering Ethereum&#8217;s status at this particular juncture. He suggests that the regulatory body is navigating a complex landscape, balancing the need to enforce securities laws with the market&#8217;s reliance on existing classifications.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beyond simple anti-crypto animus, it’s worth thinking about why the SEC is choosing this moment to potentially reassess ETH’s status as non-security and what may be specifically motivating them. Motive meets opportunity,&#8221; Johnsson elaborates.</p>
<p>He further speculates on the SEC&#8217;s strategy regarding ETH spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and its broader implications: &#8220;My view, and there are other reasonable takes, is that the SEC needs a non-correlation objection to deny ETH spot ETFs this year and has a desire to avoid undermining the args in the CB/Binance actions – together representing the two biggest crypto issues the agency is managing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Johnsson points out the inherent challenges in the SEC&#8217;s path, particularly maintaining a consistent approach to crypto regulation so as not to prejudice its own arguments in the<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/paradigm-industry-titans-rallying-behind-coinbase/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> cases against Coinbase</a> <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-us-faces-sec-probe-over-asset-handling/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">and Binance</a>. He notes, &#8220;And if the SEC learned anything from BTC ETFs, it’s to be very careful in the reasoning provided in denials and specifically that it form a coherent whole across similar orders. Grayscale won because the SEC made logical errors when approving futures and denying spot across time.&#8221;</p>

<p>The finance lawyer also delves into the technicalities of correlation analysis, a pivotal factor in the SEC&#8217;s decision-making process for ETF approvals. He explains, &#8220;Using the methodology I believe the SEC will rely, CME futures:spot correlation is INCREASING and the most recent periods are mostly within an acceptable range (i.e., aligning with BTC approval levels). At least based on internally run calcs.&#8221; Therefore, the SEC cannot reject a spot ETF on this basis.</p>
<p>Johnsson underscores the SEC&#8217;s delicate balancing act, which cannot question its previous decisions, but at the same time has to deny spot ETH ETF to satisfy its backers. He articulates, &#8220;This kills a few birds: 1) bolsters credibility for CB/Binance args, 2) denies spot ETH ETF with 2025 optionality and 3) satisfies Gary’s backers. All while avoiding (for now) blowing up CME futures, an interagency fight and invalidating futures ETFs (miring SEC in litigation).&#8221;</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Democratic Senators Jack Reed and Laphonza Butler <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/us-senators-urge-sec-no-more-crypto-etfs/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">called on SEC Chairman Gary Gensler</a> to halt the approval of additional spot crypto ETFs. Senator Elizabeth Warren has also expressed strong criticism of these financial products. Last year, Butler endorsed Senator Elizabeth Warren’s contentious <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/us-senators-efforts-to-kill-crypto-move-forward/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act</a> by co-sponsoring the bill.</p>
<p>At press time, ETH traded at $3,526.</p>

<title>Former FTX Executive’s Platform Secures $60 Million In Claims, Here Are The Details</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/former-ftx-executives-platform-secures-60-million/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/former-ftx-executives-platform-secures-60-million/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。前FTX客户将灾难转化为可能有利可图的投资，购买FTX破产索赔并建立投资基金。他们帮助其他受害者购买索赔，并处理赔款，许多人准备重新投资加密货币市场。尽管存在复杂性和挑战，但FTX Creditor的努力带来了一定程度的满足和希望。FTT代币目前价格上涨，但在较长时间范围内有所下降。 <div>
<p>Former FTX customers, left uncertain of the fate of their funds after the collapse of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-50-years/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">now-bankrupt crypto exchange</a>, have turned their misfortune into a potentially profitable venture. </p>
<p>Led by individuals such as Louis d&#8217;Origny and Ramnik Arora, FTX&#8217;s former head of product, this group has seized the opportunity to invest in FTX <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/blockfi-resolves-dispute-with-ftx-alameda-research/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">bankruptcy claims</a>. Their FTX Creditor platform facilitates the acquisition of millions of dollars worth of claims.</p>
<h2>FTX Collapse Spurs Lucrative Investment</h2>
<p>According to a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-21/platform-built-by-former-ftx-exec-snaps-up-60-million-in-claims" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, following FTX&#8217;s implosion, d’Origny recognized the potential investment opportunity and became one of the first to purchase FTX bankruptcy claims from fellow customers facing a similar predicament. </p>
<p>Capitalizing on this early move, d’Origny established four investment funds and acquired approximately $31 million claims. Additionally, through the FTX Creditor platform, d’Origny and his partner Arora facilitated the purchase of an additional $60 million in claims.</p>

<p>FTX Creditor primarily targets <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/former-ftx-alameda-executives-crypto-exchange-us/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">bankruptcy claimants</a> who held less than $100,000 on the exchange. d’Origny expressed his intention to create a “transparent and efficient” process for these creditors to alleviate the risks and alleged lack of transparency that “plagued” the market. </p>
<p>According to the report, when d&#8217;Origny and his team first began buying claims, they estimated that creditors would recover about 25 to 30 cents on the dollar. The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/incarcerated-sam-bankman-fried-promote-solana/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">average cost of claims</a> purchased through their third fund was 15 cents on the dollar owed. </p>
<p>Their strategy was based on the assumption that significant clawbacks would occur, resulting in significant recoveries. However, uncertainties surrounding claim pricing and new bankruptcy developments have added complexity to the process.</p>
<h2>Cryptocurrency Prices Surge Creates New Dynamics</h2>
<p>Throughout the purchasing process, d’Origny and his team encountered various challenges. In one instance, while negotiating the purchase of a $4 million claim with a customer, they learned that the US Internal Revenue Service had <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-creditors-1-billion-crypto/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">filed bankruptcy </a>claims worth billions of dollars against FTX. Despite the uncertainty, they proceeded with the purchase, albeit at a discount of 25 cents on the dollar.</p>
<p>As cryptocurrency prices experienced a significant surge, some FTX customers <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-faces-lawsuit-from-creditors-challenging/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">expressed concerns</a> about the current plan to peg the value of their holdings to digital asset prices from November 2022. </p>
<p>However, d’Origny highlighted the satisfaction of the claimants he works with, as his platform processes purchases, often within 30 minutes. According to the report, many claimants are even eager to reinvest the funds they receive back into the cryptocurrency market.</p>

<p>While the exchange has assured a bankruptcy judge that creditors who can prove their losses will likely recover their entire <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-repayment-plan-bitcoin-valued-at-16000/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">investments</a>, the rise in cryptocurrency prices presents a new dimension. </p>
<p>As challenges persist, the relief experienced by claimants and their readiness to reinvest in the cryptocurrency market demonstrates the impact of FTX Creditor&#8217;s efforts.</p>
<img alt="FTX" class="size-large" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/cAmgv1A5/" width="1815" />
<p>As of this writing, FTT is trading at $1.989, reflecting a significant surge of 10% within the past 24 hours. However, when considering longer time frames, such as the previous two weeks, the token continues to exhibit losses exceeding 20%.</p>

<title>Rumors Swirl As North Korea’s ETH Transfer To BlackRock Via Tornado Cash Sparks Speculation</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/north-koreas-eth-transfer-to-blackrock-via-tornado/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/north-koreas-eth-transfer-to-blackrock-via-tornado/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是负面的。文章指出与加密货币相关的非法活动引发了人们日益关注，报道称北朝鲜黑客与臭名昭著的拉萨路斯集团联系到以太坊（ETH）的漏洞，通过虚拟货币混合器的操作。一名社交媒体用户将北朝鲜黑客传送1 ETH（价值3270美元）给全球最大的资产管理公司黑石集团，但其动机尚不明确。此外，文章还提到Tornado Cash因涉嫌协助非法活动而受到美国制裁，并介绍了北朝鲜黑客近期利用Tornado Cash洗钱数百万美元的情况。黑石集团尚未对此做出回应。以太坊价格在过去24小时有所反弹，但仍比过去一周下跌6%。 <div>
<p>Amidst growing concerns of illicit activities involving cryptocurrencies, reports have emerged linking North Korean hackers associated with the notorious Lazarus Group to an exploit of Ethereum (ETH) through the virtual currency mixer <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/tornado-cash-founder-charged-for-allegedly-aiding-1-2-billion-in-laundered-funds/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Tornado Cash</a>. </p>
<p>It is alleged that the hackers are now involved in a transfer to BlackRock, the largest asset management firm, as claimed by a user of social media platform X (formerly Twitter).</p>
<h2>Alleged Transaction Links North Korean Hackers To BlackRock</h2>
<p>The user, operating under the pseudonym &#8220;Icebergy,&#8221; <a href="https://x.com/icebergy_/status/1770477188527071348?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">shared </a>an image suggesting a transaction tied to North Korean hackers transferring 1 ETH, valued at $3,270, to BlackRock for undisclosed reasons. </p>
<p>If true, this development may pose challenges for the asset manager. Tornado Cash and the Lazarus Group have faced increased scrutiny from US regulators due to potential illicit activities facilitated by the mixer and alleged violations of anti-money laundering (AML) <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/hackers-exploit-sanctioned-mixer-tornado-cash/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">regulations </a>within the US jurisdiction.</p>

<img alt="Blackrock " class="size-large wp-image-288744" height="157" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GJH_nszXsAEVTTj.jpeg?w=980&#038;resize=980%2C157" width="980" />
<p>As <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/tornado-cash-legal-war-against-us-sanctions-ends/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">reported </a>by Bitcoinist, in 2022, Tornado Cash faced legal action from the US Treasury Department&#8217;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). The agency targeted the software due to its alleged role in allowing cybercriminal activity. </p>
<p>The US agency claims that bad actors used Tornado Cash to launder over $7 billion worth of crypto assets since its launch in 2019. </p>
<p>Consequently, OFAC sanctioned the mixer&#8217;s wallets and other smart contracts associated with its operations. The sanctions also contain allegations of &#8220;facilitating&#8221; <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/tornado-cash-co-founde-to-us-sanctions-list/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">money laundering</a> for hackers supporting foreign terrorists, as a significant number of hacking incidents involving crypto asset theft have been linked to terrorist groups. </p>
<p>Notably, in February 2023, Chainalysis reported that North Korean hacking groups had stolen up to $2 billion in crypto assets in 2022, frequently utilizing Tornado Cash to obfuscate their <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/tornado-cash-case-could-mean-for-code-publishing/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">transactions</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, it has been revealed that North Korean hackers, believed to be part of the Lazarus Group, exploited the coin-mixing service Tornado Cash to launder approximately $12 million worth of stolen Ethereum on March 14.</p>
<h2>Tornado Cash Returns To Focus</h2>
<p>As blockchain analytics firm Elliptic <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-laundering-north-korean-tornado-cash/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">reported</a>, in response to the sanctions imposed on Tornado Cash, the Lazarus Group briefly shifted its focus to using cross-chain bridges and the Bitcoin-based mixer Sinbad.io as an alternative. </p>
<p>However, US authorities seized Sinbad.io in November 2023, eliminating another option for commingling funds. Consequently, the group appears to have returned to utilizing Tornado Cash.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the motive behind the alleged transfer of ETH tied to North Korean hackers remains undisclosed, and the relatively small amount involved raises questions about its specific objective. </p>

<p>At the time of writing, BlackRock has not responded to the matter, and no further information has been released. It is important to note that BlackRock has consistently operated within the US regulatory frameworks and complied with federal laws, which led the asset manager to receive approval from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for its newly approved Spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) under the ticker IBIT. </p>
<p>Furthermore, the presence of BlackRock&#8217;s on-chain addresses in the public blockchain does not necessarily indicate a collaborative effort but rather a unilateral move by the alleged North Korean side, perhaps to generate controversy surrounding the asset manager&#8217;s reputation.</p>
<img alt="Blackrock " class="size-large" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/xr7mKAUj/" width="1815" />
<p>Ethereum (ETH) has successfully rebounded to reach the $3,511 mark following a significant decline to the $3,069 level. In the past 24 hours, the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization has experienced a notable surge of 10%. However, the token still retains losses exceeding 6% over the past week.</p>

<title>UN Reveals: 50% Of North Korea’s Foreign Earnings From Crypto Attacks And Cyber Heists</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/un-north-koreas-foreign-earnings-crypto-attack/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/un-north-koreas-foreign-earnings-crypto-attack/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。最近联合国的调查显示，朝鲜利用加密黑客等网络活动来“支持”其经济并推进武器发展计划的程度。报告显示，朝鲜通过被认为是“恶意”的加密相关公司攻击来获取大约一半的外汇收入，支持其武器发展项目。尽管朝鲜黑客组织对安全措施的适应性有所减少，但它们仍在采用越来越“复杂”的策略继续进行网络活动。拉萨鲁斯小组的增加对Tornado Cash的依赖表明他们正通过该平台进行洗钱活动。 <div>
<p>In recent findings, an investigation by the United Nations has <a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20240321001100315#:~:text=%22The%20malicious%20cyberactivities%20of%20the,from%20%22one%20member%20state.%22" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">illuminated</a> the extent to which North Korea has leveraged cyber activities such as crypto hacks to &#8220;bolster&#8221; its economy and further its weapons development programs.</p>
<p>The report spans from 2017 to 2023 and details a series of cyberattacks targeting crypto-related firms. It highlights the approach of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea (DPRK) as it targets the nascent industry.</p>

<h2>Crypto Loot Fuels Foreign Earnings</h2>
<p>The UN revealed that North Korea has participated in <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-north-korea-linked-lazarus-group-2023-losses/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">cyber operations</a> deemed &#8220;malicious&#8221; to secure roughly half of its foreign currency earnings, which support its weapons development initiatives.</p>
<p>The panel noted, citing information from &#8220;one member state&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>The malicious cyberactivities of the Democratic People&#8217;s Republic of Korea (DPRK) generate approximately 50 percent of its foreign currency income and are used to fund its weapons programs.</p></blockquote>
<p>Particularly, with an estimated loss of $3 billion attributed to these cyber incursions, the UN&#8217;s assessment sheds light on the web of state-sponsored <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/spain-detains-fugitive-in-crypto-scheme-north-korea/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">hacking operations</a>, underscoring their significance in funding approximately 40% of the DPRK&#8217;s program to build weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<img alt="The global crypto market cap value on TradingView" class="size-medium" height="1496" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/t4paDGSz/" width="2770" />
<p>It is worth noting that the UN revelation aligns with previous estimates from the United States, further corroborated by recent analytics from blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis. The firm&#8217;s 2023 <a href="https://go.chainalysis.com/2023-crypto-crime-report.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">report</a> marks a notable year for crypto platform vulnerabilities, with North Korea linked to a record number of hacks.</p>
<h2>Adapting To Shifting Cyber Landscape</h2>
<p>However, there was a<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/surge-in-north-korean-crypto-attacks-hacks-2023/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> significant decline in the total value of stolen assets</a> compared to previous years. Despite this, the DPRK operatives persist while adapting to security measures with increasingly &#8220;sophisticated&#8221; tactics, according to Joe Dobson, principal analyst at cybersecurity firm Mandiant.</p>
<p>Dobson noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>They look at what’s changing, what’s evolving, and how they can use that malicious intent. Whatever the advancement is, they’re going to find a way to take advantage of it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Tools such as Tornado Cash for laundering stolen Ethereum further exemplify this. According to a recent report, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-heist-north-korean-hackers-swipe-600-million/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">North Korean hackers</a> associated with the notorious Lazarus Group have utilized Tornado Cash to<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-laundering-north-korean-tornado-cash/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> launder around $12 million in stolen Ethereum (ETH)</a>.</p>
<p>Elliptic reports that the Lazarus Group&#8217;s increased dependence on Tornado Cash resulted from reduced large-scale mixing services available following law enforcement&#8217;s crackdown on platforms such as Sinbad.io and Blender.io.</p>

<p>Facing limited options, the group has turned to leveraging Tornado Cash, which remains operational despite being under US sanctions.</p>

<title>OKX To Cease Operations In This Asian Country, Urging Users To Liquidate Holdings By April 30</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/okx-to-cease-operations-in-this-asian-country/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/okx-to-cease-operations-in-this-asian-country/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。OKX宣布退出印度加密货币市场，由于当地监管障碍。用户被告知关闭所有持仓，并从帐户中提取所有资金。印度金融情报单位对9家外国加密货币交易所发布了合规通知，其中包括OKX。尽管加密货币市场总估值为2.44万亿美元，但比特币的价格波动较大，正在努力保持在66700美元以上的水平。 <div>
<p>In a recent development, Seychelles-based firm OKX, one of the largest <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-crypto-dominance-declines/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">cryptocurrency exchanges</a> in the world, has announced the shutdown of its services in India. </p>
<p>According to recent <a href="https://www.financemagnates.com/cryptocurrency/okx-shuts-services-in-india-cites-local-regulations/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reports</a>, the decision comes in response to regulatory hurdles faced by the exchange in the country. Users were notified of the closure through a notice sent on Thursday, stating that OKX &#8220;is no longer providing services to the users in India&#8221; due to local regulations.</p>
<h2>OKX Announces Exit From Indian Crypto Market</h2>
<p>The notice from OKX urged users to take specific actions before the deadline. Users were instructed to close all margin positions, including perpetual, futures, and options contracts, and<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/okx-support-bitcoin-ordinals-lists-major-brc-20/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> redeem funds</a> from staking products. </p>
<p>Additionally, users were advised to withdraw all funds from their accounts. After April 30, 2024, at 2 AM UTC, account functionalities would be restricted, although fund withdrawals would still be permitted.</p>

<p>OKX&#8217;s decision to exit the Indian market follows the issuance of a compliance notice by the Indian Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) against nine foreign cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance, KuCoin, Huobi, Kraken, Gate.io, Bittrex, Bitstamp, MEXC Global, and Bitfinex. </p>
<p>The FIU alleged <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/okx-delists-usdt-trading-in-europe-heres-why/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">illegal operations</a> and violations of local anti-money laundering (AML) regulations by the exchanges above. While the FIU blocked access to these exchanges&#8217; websites with a two-week notice, some continued providing services to existing customers through apps.</p>
<p>It is noteworthy that OKX was not among the exchanges named by the FIU in its compliance notice. However, the exchange had previously strengthened its know-your-customer (KYC) processes in India. Despite these efforts, OKX has now decided to withdraw its services completely from the country.</p>
<h2>Navigating Regulatory Landscapes</h2>
<p>Despite shutting down its operations in India, OKX is focusing on strengthening its operations in other regions. As previously <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/okx-approved-a-win-for-singapores-crypto-ambitions/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">reported </a>by Bitcoinist, the exchange has obtained licenses in Singapore and Dubai, demonstrating its interest in expanding its services globally. In addition, OKX has launched trading in Turkey&#8217;s local currency.</p>
<p>The closure of OKX&#8217;s services in India highlights the challenges cryptocurrency exchanges face due to evolving<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/okx-probe-south-korea-alleged-crypto-violations/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> regulatory landscapes</a>. As governments worldwide continue to formulate their policies regarding cryptocurrencies, exchanges have to navigate a complex regulatory environment to ensure compliance and provide services to their users.</p>

<p>While OKX emphasizes the safety of user funds and assures that withdrawals will remain accessible, Indian users are encouraged to follow the exchange&#8217;s guidelines to secure their assets. </p>
<img alt="OKX" class="size-large" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/69IvXEyn/" width="1815" />
<p>As of the current time, the total valuation of the crypto market cap is $2.44 trillion. This comes after a significant decline to $2.2 trillion on Wednesday, following a peak of $2.7 trillion, which hadn&#8217;t been reached since November 2021.</p>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC), on the other hand, has made progress in minimizing its losses. After experiencing a steep drop to $60,900, it is now attempting to regain stability above the $66,700 level.</p>

<title>Here’s How This Crypto Investor Made $23.5 Million With Shiba Inu In Two Months</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-23-5-million-shiba-inu/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-23-5-million-shiba-inu/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />一位加密货币投资者在过去两个月里通过投资Shiba Inu赚取了2350万美元。他在1月份开始购买大量SHIB代币，价格低于0.00001美元，并在两个月内将其收益增长到3200万美元。此外，还有一位神秘的交易者通过在2020年8月以8000美元投资Shiba Inu成为亿万富翁，其投资回报超过50亿美元。Shiba Inu自推出以来一直在为投资者创造财富。<br /> <div>
<p class="p2">Shiba Inu has been making millionaires since its inception in 2020 and this has not changed even as it has become a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-shiba-inu-updates/">billion-dollar meme coin</a>. A crypto investor recently made a $23.5 million from investing the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-bone-new-target/">SHIB</a> token over the last two months. Here’s how they did it.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Shiba Inu Investor Makes Bank</h2>
<p class="p2">On-chain analytics platform Spot On Chain <a href="https://x.com/spotonchain/status/1766315511783006226?s=20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">revealed</a> that a particular trader had been making massive moves in the market over the last few months. The trader had begun buying large chunks of SHIB tokens back in January when the price was still trending below $0.00001. In total, the whale trader was able to accumulate around 1.24 trillion SHIB for $11.66 million at the time.</p>

<p class="p2">Then, over the next two months, the Shiba Inu price would go on an incredible rally that saw its price more than 4x. At its local peak, the SHIB price climbed as high as $0.00004 before retracing. This surge in price booked massive profits for the trader, and by mid-March, the whale investors saw their Shiba Inu holdings grow over $32 million.</p>
<p class="p2">On March 16, the trader finally took the plunge and deposited the entirety of their <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-bone-new-target/">SHIB</a> holdings to the Binance and Gate crypto exchanges. Now, when investors deposit coins to centralized exchanges, it is usually to sell. If this is the true intention of the whale investor and they were looking to sell, they would’ve made a total profit of $23.5 million after sending 1.24 trillion <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-shiba-inu-updates/">SHIB</a> to exchanges.</p>
<p class="p2">This is not the only massive trade the whale trader has made in the last few months. Spot On Chain also revealed that this particular trader also made a profit of $44.3 million on their FLOKI holdings and $5.82 million from their BIGTIME holdings.</p>
<h2 class="p2">The Legendary SHIB Investor</h2>
<p class="p2">While the whale investor above has made significant profits from investing in Shiba Inu, one trader still holds the record for a single legendary <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-price-down-today/">SHIB trade</a>. An anonymous trader who identifies as “Shibtoshi” became a billionaire by investing $8,000 in the meme coin.</p>

<p class="p2">In 2023, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/billionaire-with-shiba-inu/">Shibtoshi sat down for an interview with YouTuber Bad Anthony</a> where he revealed that he had invested $8,000 in <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-surge-in-interest/">SHIB</a> in August 2020. However, the token would not immediately perform well as Shibtoshi revealed it had dipped significantly after his purchase.</p>
<p class="p2">Eventually, the Shiba Inu market cap would rise as high as $30 billion and at the top, Shibtoshi’s <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-surge-in-interest/">SHIB</a> stash was worth over $5 billion. This single trade remains legendary in crypto as Shibtoshi became the first person to become a billionaire from trading meme coins.</p>

<title>A16z Crypto Lawyer Unleashes Scathing Attack On US SEC, Spot Ethereum ETF In Danger?</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/a16z-crypto-lawyer-us-sec-spot-ethereum-etfs/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/a16z-crypto-lawyer-us-sec-spot-ethereum-etfs/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。<br />马尔斯·詹宁斯，a16z Crypto的总法律顾问，抨击了美国证券交易委员会（SEC）及其对加密货币监管的处理。他指责SEC的加密货币执法部门存在“无能”的律师，对于DebtBox一案的处理中存在滥用权力。文章还提到了对SEC在加密ETF审批上的压力，并讨论了对雇佣前SEC加密货币执法律师的律所进行制裁的措施。舆论对此有不同看法，有些人支持詹宁斯的立场，有些人认为这种制裁措施是“惩罚性的”。 <div>
<p>Miles Jennings, the General Counsel at a16z Crypto, one of the world&#8217;s largest venture capital firms, has launched a blistering attack on the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and its handling of crypto regulation.</p>
<h2>Are The United States SEC Lawyers At The Enforcement Division Abusing Power?</h2>
<p>The lawyer specifically targeted the agency&#8217;s crypto enforcement division in a <a href="https://twitter.com/milesjennings/status/1770473643237376383" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X. Not only does the General Counsel think the division has &#8220;incompetent&#8221; lawyers, but they are &#8220;complicit in the ongoing abuses of power,&#8221; especially in light of the Debt Box case.</p>

<p>Last year, the United States SEC sued Debt Box, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/debt-box-judge-penalizes-sec-for-abuse-of-power/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">accusing</a> them of fraud, leading to the loss of over $49 million for investors. At the center of the contentious case, the regulator claimed that though DebtBox claimed they were selling node licenses to prospective investors for mining cryptocurrencies, none of these coins ended up being mined. </p>
<p>Debt Box countered these charges and won. The judge sided with the blockchain firm, accusing the United States SEC of presenting &#8220;misleading statements and abusing power.&#8221;</p>
<p>Pressure has been mounting on the agency because of the outcome of the DebtBox ruling. Most critics, especially in the crypto and blockchain sector, endorse the court&#8217;s verdict that the SEC abuses power.</p>
<p>In the post on X, Jennings said the United States SEC&#8217;s pursuit of DebtBox was a &#8220;symptom of hyper politicization&#8221; that has shaken their trust in the enforcement division. </p>
<h2>Spot Ethereum ETF Next, Same Outcome As DebtBox?</h2>
<p>For this reason, the lawyer said a16z Crypto will no longer work with law firms that hire former SEC crypto enforcement lawyers. Jennings argues that this move is necessary to combat the alleged issues within the SEC. </p>
<p>Even so, no official statement from the venture capital firm supports this statement.</p>

<p>The post remains controversial, drawing varied comments. While some commentators supported the lawyer&#8217;s stance, others argued that blacklisting law firms hiring from the enforcement division will be &#8220;punitive.&#8221; </p>
<p>Amid the storm, some are defending the professionalism and ethics of <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/JasonBerkun/status/1770620239161553051" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">some</a> of the agency&#8217;s lawyers, acknowledging there could be &#8220;bad faith&#8221; actors in any organization.</p>
<p>How the agency will respond to criticism remains to be seen, especially from the crypto community. The commission will likely be under fire as laws are drafted and policy evolves. </p>

<p>Presently, eyes are also on the United States SEC and how they will rule on the multiple spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs). In a recent post on X, Paul Grewal, the General Counsel for Coinbase, <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/iampaulgrewal/status/1770594634785542476" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">said</a> the agency has &#8220;no reason to decline applications made for the product.&#8221;</p>

<title>Did This Bitcoin On-Chain Metric Predict Recovery In Advance?</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-on-chain-metric-predict-recovery-in-advance/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />比特币的调整SOPR在最新的复苏之前重新测试了一个历史相关线。分析显示，比特币价格下跌至60,600美元后反弹。aSOPR指标在价格下跌期间降至1.0水平，表明投资者正在以净利润出售比特币。在价格回调时，损失开始积累，aSOPR向1.0水平回落。1.0水平通常是比特币找到反弹的点。目前比特币价格约为67,000美元，过去一周上涨5%。 <div>
<p>On-chain data indicates that Bitcoin had retested a historically relevant line right before the latest recovery had come.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Adjusted SOPR Retested The 1.0 Level Prior To Recovery</h2>
<p>When Bitcoin was declining, the cryptocurrency had dropped to a low of $60,600, which appears to have been the bottom, at least so far, given that the coin has rebounded sharply since hitting the mark.</p>
<p>Around the time of BTC&#8217;s recent low prices, an analyst had pointed out in a CryptoQuant Quicktake <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/65fb1988a3be2268b3df088e-Understanding-ASOPR-and-Market-Behavior" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> that the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-sopr-nears-vital-retest-bulls-find-victory/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Adjusted Spent Output Profit Ratio (aSOPR)</a> had plunged to a value of 1 alongside the asset&#8217;s drop.</p>

<p>The aSOPR is an on-chain indicator that tells us whether Bitcoin investors realize a net profit or loss with their current selling.</p>
<p>This metric works by going through the blockchain history of each coin being transferred currently to check what price it was moved at before this. If the last price was greater than the current price, the coin&#8217;s sale would realize a loss; otherwise, it would count under profit-taking.</p>
<p>The aSOPR can only say this, of course, with the assumption that both of these transactions involved a change of hands for the coin in question (that is, selling/buying took place).</p>
<p>As for why the aSOPR has &#8220;Adjusted&#8221; in its name, this version of the SOPR metric has been adjusted to exclude coins that transferred within only an hour of their previous transaction.</p>
<p>Such transfers are usually essentially noise for the indicator as they don&#8217;t pose any greater consequence for the market, hence why they aren&#8217;t taken into account.</p>
<p>Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin aSOPR over the past few years:</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin aSOPR" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="806" src="https://i0.wp.com/img.cryptoquant.com/368746/quicktake/cNy0f_9973b23ddfd075adad5ca7f75afea53d770d1c1269f7980bc43a1d928b18c702.png?resize=1280%2C806&#038;ssl=1" width="1280" /></p>

<p>As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin aSOPR had surged to very high levels as the coin had set its <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-breaks-through-69000-setting-new-record/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">new all-time high</a> beyond the $73,000 level. This means that the transactions being made on the network were profit-heavy on average.</p>
<p>With the price drawdown, though, loss-taking also started taking hold as the aSOPR retreated toward the 1.0 level. At this value, the market as a whole is just breaking even on its selling.</p>

<p>&#8220;When positions are stopped out or panic selling is sufficient, we anticipate the market nearing its local bottom,&#8221; notes the quant. This pattern is also visible in the chart, as major bottoms have formed when loss-taking has been dominant.</p>
<p>The 1.0 level itself, however, has been a point where the cryptocurrency has sometimes found rebounds. The most recent example of this trend would be the low back in January, which formed when the aSOPR retested this mark.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $67,000, up 5% in the past week.</p>

<title>Cardano On The Brink: Crypto Analyst Predicts 1,800% Price Explosion To $12</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-1800-price-explosion-12/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-1800-price-explosion-12/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的<br />加密分析师Trend Rider对ADA提出了乐观的论述，认为其将再次上涨并超过其历史最高价。他预测ADA可能升至12美元，指出当前市场情绪正在转为看涨。与此同时，其他分析师也表示看好ADA未来表现。当前ADA价格为0.63美元，已突破20日和50日移动平均线，有望升至0.70美元。ADA在短期目标为0.80至0.83美元，随后可能进一步上涨至下一个关键价位。 <div>
<p>Crypto analyst Trend Rider has provided a bullish narrative for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/swiss-firm-launches-cardano-staking-etp/">Cardano (ADA)</a> despite its relatively unimpressive performance in this bull market. Based on his analysis, ADA will again rise to its <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/major-moves-for-cardano-ada/">all-time high (ATH)</a> and even surpass it. </p>
<h2>Cardano Could Hit A New ATH Of $12</h2>
<p>Trend Rider suggested in an X (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/TrendRidersTR/status/1770441959020093907?s=20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> that ADA could rise to as high as $12 as ADA’s market shifts from a bearish to a bullish sentiment. His analysis focused on ADA’s 2-week chart, which showed that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/the-200-day-moving-average-ma-why-is-it-important-for-bitcoin/">key moving averages</a> are realigning, the analyst claimed. Trend Rider added that this could mark a transition towards a bullish framework as the candlesticks turn green. </p>

<p>He further noted that this move on the charts shares similarities with a previous pattern that played out just before ADA made its run in the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/rewards-2021-bitcoin-bull-buyers-finally-break-even/">last bull market</a>. Meanwhile, although Trend Rider didn’t give a timeframe for this imminent move, he <a href="https://x.com/TrendRidersTR/status/1770447180794401263?s=20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">noted</a> that this was a long-term analysis and warned that ADA investors must be patient while this plays out. </p>
<p>ADA’s recent price action has caused Cardano investors to worry, especially with other crypto tokens recording significant gains. However, Trend Rider’s analysis no doubt provides reassurance that ADA will still have its moment. Dan Gambardello, the founder of Crypto Capital Venture, had also previously <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano/cardano-price-about-to-explode/#:~:text=Gambardello%20mentioned%20in%20a%20video,time%20ADA%20made%20a%20breakout." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">dispelled</a> the notion that ADA won’t perform well in this bull cycle. </p>
<p>Gambardello mentioned that ADA was where it was meant to be before it took off. Like Trend Rider, he also alluded to the 2021 bull run, noting that ADA was lagging at the initial stages of that cycle and didn’t make a significant move to the upside until about two months after <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-breaks-through-69000-setting-new-record/">Bitcoin broke its previous ATH</a>.</p>
<h2>What Next For ADA?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/ada/cardano-ada-price-to-11/#:~:text=According%20to%20him%2C%20this%20is,the%20next%20Bitcoin%20Halving%20event." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Gambardello</a> recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xI95woGXrMU&amp;t=1s" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">analyzed</a> ADA’s daily chart and noted that the crypto token had already broken its 20-day and 50-day moving averages. The analyst claimed that a close above the 50-day moving average could see Cardano rise to the $0.70 price range. </p>

<p>Gambaradello also sounded bullish on <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-analyst-sets-5-target-for-cardano-price-how/">ADA’s future trajectory</a>. He stated that the charts showed that ADA was well primed to make a similar one like the one it did in the last cycle. His bullish target for ADA in the short term is the $0.80 to $0.83 price range, as he claimed that is the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-analyst-predicts-1300-for-cardano/">breakout area</a>. </p>
<p>If a breakout were to occur from that price range, then he foresees ADA rising to the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cardano/cardano-price-about-to-explode/#:~:text=Gambardello%20mentioned%20in%20a%20video,time%20ADA%20made%20a%20breakout." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">$1.40 to $1.50 price range</a> next.  At the time of writing, ADA is trading at around $0.63, up over 8% in the last 24 hours according to data from CoinMarketCap. </p>

<title>Dogecoin Surges 16% As X Payments Secures 3 New Licenses</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-surges-x-payments-secures-3-new-licenses/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章报道了X Payments公司在美国三个州获得关键的转账许可证，推动了其在美国金融监管领域的扩张，并显示了对法规合规的重视。此外，狗狗币价格上涨了16%，由于Coinbase衍生品计划推出狗狗币期货合约，更加确立了其作为可投资资产的地位。同时，埃隆·马斯克表达了将狗狗币作为购买特斯拉汽车的支付方式的意愿，进一步推动了市场的热情。 <div>
<p>The Dogecoin price is witnessing a strong upswing today, recording an 16% increase as X Payments, under the aegis of Elon Musk, secured pivotal money transmitter licenses across three additional US states. This milestone, first reported via X News Daily on X, includes the acquisition of licenses in Illinois, New Mexico, and Oregon, propelling X Payments into a significant phase of expansion within the United States’ financial regulatory landscape.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">NEWS: X Payments receives 3 more licenses including Illinois, New Mexico and Oregon. <a href="https://t.co/wIMhhFPCwd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/wIMhhFPCwd</a></p>

<p></p>
<h2>Strategic Expansion And Regulatory Compliance</h2>
<p>X Payments LLC’s strategic pursuit of money transmitter licenses underscores its ambition to cement a formidable presence across the US. With these three new licenses, X Payments’ operational footprint now spans 22 states, marking a critical step towards national coverage.</p>

<p>The focused expansion into Illinois, New Mexico, and Oregon, as confirmed on March 20, reflects a calculated approach to navigating the complex web of state-level financial regulations.</p>
<p>Recently, Elon Musk <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/elon-musk-tesla-dogecoin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">revealed</a> in a talk with Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Invest, an ambitious timeline, aiming for the rollout of payment features for X by mid-2024. This forward-looking statement aligns with Musk’s vision of an &#8220;everything app,&#8221; reminiscent of platforms like Chinese WeChat &#8211; an app for financial transactions, social interactions, and multimedia communications.</p>
<p>Notably, X Payments&#8217; registration with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as a money service business (MSB) was another pivotal compliance achievement in recent weeks. This designation is crucial for operating within the US&#8217;s financial ecosystem, ensuring adherence to anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) standards.</p>

<p>The anticipation surrounding X Payments’ potential to integrate cryptocurrencies, notably Dogecoin, into its payment solutions has been a significant catalyst for market movements. The speculative association between X Payments and Dogecoin, fueled by Elon Musk’s well-documented affinity for the memecoin, has had a tangible impact on its valuation and investor sentiment.</p>
<h2>Dogecoin Price Rises By 16%</h2>
<p>Over the past 24 hours, Dogecoin&#8217;s price soared to $0.1551, encapsulating a 16% appreciation. Notably, the bullish trend was further supported by Coinbase Derivatives&#8217; strategic move to launch Dogecoin futures, an initiative greenlit by the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). This development not only enhances Dogecoin&#8217;s market liquidity but also legitimizes its status as an investable asset within the broader cryptocurrency ecosystem.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Coinbase Derivatives will launch the first leveraged and CFTC-regulated futures contracts for Bitcoin Cash, Dogecoin, and Litecoin in April!</p>

<p></p>
<p>Last week, Elon Musk <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-gains-momentum-as-musk-hints-at-future-tesla-payments-is-doge-going-to-the-moon/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">remarked</a> his desire to add DOGE as a payment method to purchase Tesla cars in the near future. In a viral X video shared on March 14 capturing Musk’s recent visit to Giga Berlin, the billionaire stated, “When can you buy Tesla with Dogecoin? At some point, I think we should enable that,” Musk added, “You can buy Tesla merch with DOGE, which is cool. So, Dogecoin to the moon.”</p>
<p>In January, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/x-payments-dogecoin-integration/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">establishment</a> of an X Payments account on X signaled intentions to introduce services within the year. Although the XPayments account has remained silent, without any posts, and X has not detailed the specific payment features it intends to roll out, market participants are speculating that Dogecoin (DOGE) may be included in the offerings, a speculation fueled by its sporadic references from the platform&#8217;s proprietor, Elon Musk.</p>

<title>Shiba Inu To Make ‘Miracle Recovery’ To New ATH, SHIB Marketing Lead Says</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-to-make-miracle-recovery-to-new-ath/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-to-make-miracle-recovery-to-new-ath/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章讨论了Shiba Inu（SHIB）代币面临的挑战，包括价格下跌和烧毁率下降。尽管SHIB价格有所回升，团队表达乐观情绪，但分析师仍持谨慎态度。此外，烧毁率下降可能影响未来价格走势，而SHIB的未来发展取决于团队的实力和代币的实用性。Lucie对实现新高有信心，但路径充满挑战。 <div>
<p>Shiba Inu (SHIB), the popular meme coin, finds itself at a crossroads. While the project&#8217;s marketing lead, Lucie, recently expressed bullish sentiment on Twitter, the token&#8217;s price struggles to regain lost ground, and its burn rate has taken a nosedive.</p>

<h2><strong>The &#8216;Miracle&#8217; Rebound Of Shiba Inu</strong></h2>
<p>Lucie made a post on X about her belief that SHIB can pull off a &#8220;miracle recovery&#8221; and reach a new all-time high (ATH) soon. This optimistic outlook comes amidst a period of decline for SHIB.</p>
<p>Since March 14th, the token has shed over 20%, currently trading at roughly 70% below its October 2021 peak. However, Lucie clarifies that her statement is a personal opinion, not an official prediction from the Shiba Inu team.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p></p>
<p>At the time of writing, Shiba Inu was trading at $0.000027, up 5.0% in the last 24 hours, but sustained <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">a 17% drop in value</a> in the last seven days, data from Coingecko shows.</p>
<p>Despite Lucie&#8217;s confidence, analysts remain cautious. The cryptocurrency market is notoriously volatile, and SHIB&#8217;s future hinges on various factors beyond individual pronouncements.</p>
<p>The upcoming Bitcoin halving in April, where the daily production of new Bitcoins is cut in half, is often seen as a potential catalyst for a broader market upswing. However, its impact on SHIB specifically remains to be seen.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/EynfGihk/" width="2475" /></p>

<p>Adding to the concerns is the recent plunge in SHIB&#8217;s burn rate. Initiatives like burning – sending tokens to unspendable wallets, effectively reducing supply – are often employed by meme coin projects to combat their massive supply and potentially drive price increases.</p>
<h2><strong>Shiba Inu Burn Rate Down</strong></h2>
<p>According to Shibburn, a platform tracking SHIB burns, the burn rate has fallen by nearly 73% in the last 24 hours compared to the previous day. This decline could dampen investor enthusiasm, as a lower burn rate weakens the argument for future price appreciation.</p>

<p>SHIB&#8217;s current market position also presents a challenge. While it sits comfortably at 11th place in terms of market capitalization, it&#8217;s nipping at the heels of its bigger meme coin brother, Dogecoin (DOGE), which holds the 10th spot on CoinMarketCap.</p>
<p>Both tokens have benefited from social media hype and celebrity endorsements in the past, but replicating that level of excitement might prove difficult.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, the success of Shiba Inu hinges on several key factors. The team&#8217;s ability to deliver on its development promises, reignite community engagement, and potentially find utility cases for the token beyond its meme coin status will be crucial.</p>
<p>Lucie&#8217;s optimism might spark a flicker of hope for SHIB holders, but the path to a new ATH remains paved with challenges.</p>

The exchange asserts that Dogecoin has transcended from its status as a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/meme-coin-madness-sends-ethereum-fees-soaring/">meme coin</a>, emerging as a prominent digital asset within the evolving crypto market. </p>
<h2>Coinbase To List Dogecoin In Futures Contract</h2>
<p>In a series of <a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/k3n74unfin40/2RTxHc9xRZVFMDZnhmSFex/5745e3ed14b134efeac48b2a0759b7d3/2024-8_Listing_of_DOG_Futures.docx.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">letters</a> addressed to the United States <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cftcs-landmark-year-crypto-cases-account-for-2023/">Commodity Future Trading Commission (CFTC)</a>, Coinbase Derivatives, a Designated Contract Market (DCM), revealed intentions to list Dogecoin in its futures contract. The crypto exchange had relayed its plan to incorporate Dogecoin into its cash-settled <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-volatility-713-carnage-crypto-futures/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">future contract products</a> as early as Thursday, March 7. </p>

<p>Notably, the derivatives exchange has revealed that Dogecoin futures contracts will be available to trade on its platform on or by Monday, April 1, 2024. This move marks a pivotal moment for DOGE, which has been viewed as a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/why-shiba-inu-pepe-dogecoin-are-far-from-done/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">humorous meme coin</a> since its inception. </p>
<p>Coinbase has also justified its decision to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-coinbase-bitcoin-dogecoin/">list Dogecoin</a> by claiming that the cryptocurrency has evolved beyond the title of a meme coin, highlighting the cryptocurrency’s growing influence and value in the market. The exchange’s announcement also comes at a time when <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-gains-momentum-as-musk-hints-at-future-tesla-payments-is-doge-going-to-the-moon/">DOGE&#8217;s popularity</a> and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-price-highest-level/">price dynamics</a> have been growing stronger. </p>
<p>“Dogecoin’s enduring popularity and the active community support suggest that it has transcended its origins as a meme to become a staple of the cryptocurrency world,” the exchange wrote. </p>
<p>More interestingly, Coinbase’s letters to the CFTC have indicated that the derivatives exchange may proceed with listing <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin/dogecoin-open-interest-record-2/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dogecoin futures contracts</a> before obtaining formal approval from the US agency. Additionally, the crypto exchange has disclosed its intention to utilize the self-certification method to launch the futures contract. </p>
<p>In light of these, Dogecoin is not the only cryptocurrency set to receive a listing by Coinbase. Popular cryptocurrencies like <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/litecoin/litecoin-beats-out-dogecoin-bitcoin-to-emerge-as-top-crypto-for-payments/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Litecoin (LTC)</a> and <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/bch/bitcoin-cash-price-gains-282/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Bitcoin Cash (BCH)</a> have been included in Coinbase’s futures contract plans, with trading expected to commence by April 1, if no objections are made by the CFTC. </p>
<h2>From Meme To Mainstream</h2>
<p>Dogecoin, originally created as a joke based on the popular <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/forget-dogecoin-shiba-inu-set-to-become-the-top-dog-expert-predicts-100-billion-market-cap/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Shiba Inu</a> dog, has continually defied expectations, gaining substantial traction and recognition within the crypto market over the years. Despite its <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/company/from-meme-to-millions-the-dogecoin-revolution-in-australian-online-casinos/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">meme coin origins</a>, the cryptocurrency has developed a strong reputation and <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/dogecoin-orbit-expands-over-890000-new-addresses-join-doge-community/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">cultivated a dedicated community of supporters</a> and enthusiasts who have contributed greatly to its development by propelling its adoption and value to great heights. </p>

<p>Coinbase’s decision to incorporate DOGE into its futures contracts reflects the cryptocurrency’s growing acceptance within the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-when-dogecoin-does-this/">mainstream digital asset market</a>. By listing the popular doggy-themed cryptocurrency in its futures contract, Coinbase not only expands its impressive product offerings but also grants its users access to Dogecoin, providing additional avenues for trading and investing. </p>

<title>Bitcoin Surges Back Above $67,000 As Buyers Return On Coinbase</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-surges-back-67000-buyers-return-coinbase/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。比特币在过去一天中出现了显着的回升，数据显示购买压力已经回归到加密货币交易所Coinbase上。Coinbase的比特币溢价已经再次转为正值，显示出美国机构投资者的购买压力增加。这一指标显示了美国机构投资者与全球投资者之间的购买行为差异。随着溢价值的回升，比特币价格也有了显着的恢复。这对于监测资产可能是值得继续关注的，因为任何变化可能会反映在资产价值上。

 <div>
<p>Bitcoin has made some notable recovery in the past day as data suggests buying pressure has returned on the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Has Flipped Back To Positive</h2>
<p>As pointed out by CryptoQuant Netherlands community manager Maartunn in a <a href="https://twitter.com/JA_Maartun/status/1770578250579816549" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap has surged back into the positive territory.</p>
<p>The &#8220;<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-coinbase-premium-gap-green-why-this-bullish/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Coinbase Premium Gap</a>&#8221; here refers to a metric that keeps track of the difference between the BTC prices listed on Coinbase (USD pair) and Binance (USDT pair).</p>

<p>What this indicator tells us about is how the buying (or selling) behaviors differ between the userbases of the two platforms. The users of the exchanges would have some overlap, of course, but there is one key difference between them: the former platform is the preferred one for US-based <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-breaks-52000-institutional-buying-continues/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">institutional entities</a>.</p>
<p>This means that the premium&#8217;s value can provide hints about whether these humongous American traders are buying more or less than the global investors Binance hosts.</p>
<p>Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap over the past few days:</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="2580" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GJJbiKvW8AASRQv?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096" width="4096" /></p>

<p>As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Coinbase Premium Gap had turned significantly red earlier. Alongside these negative values, BTC observed a steep decline that took its value as low as $60,600. This pattern implies that the selling pressure from American institutional investors may have played a role in the drawdown cryptocurrency went through.</p>
<p>And indeed, the trend is actually in line with what has been observed this year so far, as the Coinbase Premium Gap has appeared to have been guiding the price throughout. It would seem that BTC&#8217;s price action in this <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etf-fee-war-grayscale-ceo-says-gbtc-fees-will-drop-over-time/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">post-ETF environment</a> is being notably influenced by the institutional entities.</p>
<p>From the chart, it&#8217;s visible that the indicator&#8217;s value has turned back green in the past day and just like the red values accompanied a net decline, this buying pressure has led to the coin registering some sharp recovery.</p>
<p>These positive premium levels have come as the US Federal Reserve has revealed in its latest meeting that the interest rates would remain unchanged for now and that there would still only be three cuts in the year ahead.</p>

<p>Given the relationship that the Bitcoin spot price and Coinbase Premium Gap have apparently held in this first quarter of 2024, the metric may be worth continuing to monitor, as any changes in it may reflect on the asset.</p>
<p>Should the current positive values of the indictor persist, BTC may become likely to further its surge, as it would mean that the large investors are backing the rally.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>So far in Bitcoin&#8217;s recovery since the Coinbase Premium Gap has turned positive, the asset has managed to climb back towards the $67,000 level.</p>

<title>Montenegro Orders Do Kwon Extradition To South Korea – Details</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/montenegro-orders-do-kwon-extradition-to-s-korea/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/montenegro-orders-do-kwon-extradition-to-s-korea/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要: 这些信息是消极的。文章介绍了TerraForm Labs创始人Do Kwon与2022年Terra生态系统崩溃的关联，以及Montenegro上诉法院拒绝将其引渡至美国。Kwon失踪后被捕，目前面临韩国指控优先于美国。投资者失去大笔资金，美国可能会继续追究Kwon的诈骗指控。该案突显了加密货币领域的法律复杂性，全球加密社区期待这一案件的发展。 <div>
<p>Do Kwon, the beleaguered founder of TerraForm Labs, is <a href="https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/2024-03-21/business/finance/Montenegro-court-confirms-extradition-of-disgraced-crypto-mogul-Do-Kwon-to-Korea/2007542" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">headed to South Korea to face charges</a> connected to the 2022 Terra ecosystem collapse. This follows a Montenegrin appeals court rejecting his final attempt to be extradited to the United States.</p>
<p>The decision marks the culmination of a months-long legal battle where both South Korea and the US sought Kwon&#8217;s extradition. Kwon, once hailed as the &#8220;cryptocurrency king,&#8221; vanished after the dramatic downfall of his crypto project Terra, which resulted in <a href="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2024/03/602_371135.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">billions of dollars lost by investors</a>. He was eventually apprehended in Montenegro last year while attempting to flee with forged travel documents.</p>

<h2><strong>Do Kwon Attorney Says Case Is &#8216;Finally Settled&#8217;</strong></h2>
<p>According to Kwon&#8217;s lawyer, Goran Rodic, the extradition case is &#8220;finally settled.&#8221; The Montenegrin court&#8217;s ruling hinged on the earlier submission date of South Korea&#8217;s extradition request compared to the US&#8217;s. Prioritization based on timing is standard practice in international extradition cases, and the court determined South Korea had a stronger claim due to the earlier request.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Montenegro’s courts confirm a ruling that South Korea’s extradition demand for disgraced crypto mogul Do Kwon has priority over a similar demand by the US <a href="https://t.co/abYfIAy9Ee" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://t.co/abYfIAy9Ee</a></p>
<p>— Bloomberg Markets (@markets) <a href="https://twitter.com/markets/status/1770467154099331163?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">March 20, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>Legal experts view this development as significant. While specifics of the charges Kwon faces in South Korea remain undisclosed, the Montenegrin court&#8217;s decision suggests they believe South Korea is the primary jurisdiction where alleged crimes occurred.</p>
<p>Although Do Kwon will face the South Korean justice system first, the US may still pursue its own charges. American authorities suspect Kwon of fraud and other financial crimes related to the Terra collapse. Experts predict the US will continue its case against Kwon, potentially seeking his extradition from South Korea after he faces initial charges there.</p>
<p>This could be a protracted legal battle spanning multiple continents. The outcome of Kwon&#8217;s South Korean case will undoubtedly influence the US&#8217;s strategy.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/3jYLOs4j/" width="2475" /></p>

<p>The news deals a blow to investors who lost significant sums in the Terra ecosystem collapse. Many had hoped Kwon would face US courts, believing the American justice system would deliver harsher penalties. South Korea&#8217;s legal framework for cryptocurrency-related offenses is still evolving, raising concerns about the potential consequences Kwon might face.</p>

<h2><strong>Legal Complexities Surrounding Crypto Arena</strong></h2>
<p>South Korean investor groups impacted by the Terra collapse are likely calling for the full accountability of Do Kwon. They urge South Korean authorities to hold him accountable to the fullest extent of the law.</p>
<p>Kwon&#8217;s case highlights the legal complexities surrounding the burgeoning world of cryptocurrency. Regulatory frameworks struggle to keep pace with the rapid innovation in the crypto space, leaving questions about jurisdiction and accountability for large-scale financial losses.</p>
<p>As Do Kwon prepares for extradition, the global crypto community awaits the next chapter in this saga. Investors seek restitution, while regulators grapple with the challenge of ensuring transparency and accountability within the evolving digital financial landscape.</p>

<title>Shiba Inu Team Just Dropped The Latest SHIB Magazine, Here’s The 411</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-latest-shib-magazine/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-latest-shib-magazine/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。Shiba Inu团队最近发布了最新一期的杂志，介绍了他们在发展中取得的成就。重点包括Shiba Inu与Binance Pay的合作，Marswap聚合器的推出，SHIB名称服务的成功以及SHEB代币的受欢迎程度。总体而言，团队的创新和合作关系正在为Shiba Inu带来巨大成功。 <div>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-investing-meme-coins/">The Shiba Inu (SHIB) team</a> recently released the latest edition of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-team-shib-magazine/">’The Shib’ magazine</a>. As expected, it features exciting updates from the team on milestones achieved in their quest to grow the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shibarium-99-decline/">ecosystem</a>. </p>
<h2>Shiba Inu’s Partnership With Binance Pay</h2>
<p>The Shiba Inu team drew the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shib-grayscale-shiba-inu-etf/">SHIB community’s</a> attention to the fact that the SHIB token is already on <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-pay-launches-in-brazil-enabling-merchants/">Binance Pay</a>, Binance’s payment service. They highlighted how this integration has benefited the meme coin and Binance. The number of Binance pay transactions made in SHIB is said to have grown 30% year-on-year from 2022 to 2023. </p>

<p>SHIB was also in the top 6 most popular Binance Pay transaction currencies by transaction count in 2022 and 2023. The team acknowledged that Binance Pay provided much-needed visibility for the meme coin “when crypto was still struggling to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-winter-over-morgan-stanley-april-2024/">come out of the crypto winter</a>.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, seeing as how this partnership has so far been beneficial, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-team-shib-burn/">Shiba Inu team</a> also used the opportunity to urge members of the community, especially those who have yet to do so, to keep using Binance Pay. They further highlighted the benefits of using the payment service and the convenience it provides. </p>
<p>In a subsequent post on the magazine, the team put the spotlight on Marswap aggregator, Shibarium’s foremost aggregator. Having just launched, Marswap has promised to slash trading costs on the Shibarium network by 15%. These reduced trading costs can help increase trading activity on the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shibarium-public/">layer-2 network</a> if eventually accomplished. </p>
<p>Marswap’s launch is also timely, considering that Bitcoinist <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shibarium-99-decline/">recently reported</a> that Shibarium is experiencing a 99% decline in daily transactions recorded. </p>
<h2>Shiba Inu Records Success With Name Service</h2>
<p>As highlighted in the magazine, the SHIB name service <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shib-name-service-launch/">launched</a> about two weeks ago has been a success. The demand for this service is said to have exceeded expectations, with thousands of registrations pouring in from <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-8-billion-shib-burned/#:~:text=Over%208%20Billion%20Shiba%20Inu%20Burned%20In%20The%20Last%2024%20Hours&amp;text=As%20a%20result%20of%20this,transferred%20to%20a%20dead%20wallet." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">members of the SHIB community</a>. Interestingly, the premium names have been highly coveted despite costing more, with a starting price point of $50 per name. </p>

<p>The team also revealed in the magazine that public access to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-game-changing/">Shib Names</a> is scheduled for March 26, after which the D3 Marketplace will launch. Once the marketplace launches, users will be able to trade their Shiba names. </p>
<p>SHEB, the token representing the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-ethereum-erc-404-nft/">‘SHEboshis’ NFT</a> (non-fungible token) collection, is another of the team’s innovations that are enjoying immense success. SHEB was recently listed on CoinW, a leading trading platform, and is said to be rapidly gaining popularity. Since being listed on the platform, the ERC-404 token has ranked among the trending crypto tokens every week. </p>

<title>Primary Threat To XRP Ledger Uncovered, Guess What It Is?</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/primary-threat-to-xrp-ledger-uncovered/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/primary-threat-to-xrp-ledger-uncovered/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。<br />文章指出了有关Ripple对XRP Ledger的潜在威胁的争议。有人声称Ripple正在采取措施来隐藏其XRP销售，引入EVM侧链可能是为了提高匿名性。然而，Ripple的CTO否认了这些指控，并表示在加密交易所出售代币比在区块链上更容易匿名。文章还讨论了之前有关美国证券交易委员会裁定XRP为证券的情况。关于Ripple使用EVM以增加匿名性的争议仍在继续。 <div>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/secs-new-rules-sparks-trouble-for-xrp-ledger-amm/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">XRP Ledger</a> and Ripple are at a fork in the road, as several speculations regarding Ripple being the major threat to the XRPL emerge within the cryptocurrency community questioning the independence of the initiative. The XRP Ledger is well-known for its speed, security, and low transaction fees reaching multiple significant milestones since it was introduced.</p>
<h2>Ripple Emerges As XRP Ledger&#8217;s Biggest Threat</h2>
<p>In a heated <a href="https://x.com/offledger/status/1770375255179296956?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">conversation</a>, Onledger asserted that the &#8220;greatest threat to the XRP ledger is the team everyone idolizes (Ripple),&#8221; and is presently looking to inflict additional harm by hiding its XRP sales through the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-sidechain-xrp-ledger-close-to-launch/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) sidechain.</a></p>

<p>Onledger further claimed that there is &#8220;no other explanation&#8221; for why the payment firm is rushing with hooks unless &#8220;XAHAU and hooks pose a threat.&#8221; Although Hooks would provide smart contract capability to the XRPL, it is important to note that Ripple has demonstrated prudence in this regard.</p>
<p>The post read:</p>
<blockquote><p>Been saying it for ages. The team that everyone looks up to, Ripple, poses the greatest threat to the XRPL. They will now use EVM to shit on everyone even more. There is no other reason why they are suddenly using hooks except because XAHAU and hooks pose a threat.</p></blockquote>
<p>According to Onledger, the only reason why Ripple is thinking about implementing an EVM sidechain is hooks. Moreover, they claim that the payment company is adopting the EVM sidechain in order to &#8220;wrap its XRP and sell it off anonymously.&#8221; However, this was something they were unable to accomplish while utilizing &#8220;native smart contract capability.&#8221; As a result, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-vs-sec-crucial-dates-2024/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ripple</a> is now quiet about the EVM sidechain, which is why no one has come across anyone willing to &#8220;run witness servers.&#8221; </p>
<p>Ripple Chief Technology Officer (CTO) David Schwartz has weighed in on the subject, refuting Onledger&#8217;s claims. In response to the allegations, Schwartz stated that the financial firm would not need to take such drastic measures if it truly intended to conceal its XRP sales over time. &#8220;Ripple can sell as many tokens as we want on crypto exchanges with less responsibility than selling them on blockchains,&#8221; Schwartz stated.</p>
<h2>Exchanges Do Not Provide Anonymity</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, Onledger disputes <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-tokens-vs-ripple-shares-cto-david-schwartz-reveals-his-choice/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Schwartz</a>&#8216;s statement saying that &#8220;cryptocurrency exchanges do not provide for Ripple&#8217;s anonymity,&#8221; while drawing attention to a previous statement made by the CTO regarding the firm&#8217;s ODL-related sales with a United States Nexus.</p>

<p>It is noteworthy that in July 2023, concerns about sales related to ODL were raised when a US court ruled in favor of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and declared that XRP, which Ripple offers institutional investors, is a security.</p>
<p>Onledger believes that Ripple is utilizing the EVM to make their operations anonymous. However, Schwartz once again responded, saying that &#8220;no one else knows who we are, but the exchanges do.&#8221;</p>

<title>Ethereum In Regulatory Hot Seat: SEC Security Classification Looms</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-in-the-hot-seat-sec-security-label-looms/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-in-the-hot-seat-sec-security-label-looms/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要: 这些信息是消极的。<br />以太坊的地位充满不确定性，因为美国证券交易委员会正在对以太坊基金会进行调查。调查可能旨在将以太坊的本土代币以太（ETH）分类为证券，这可能会对加密货币市场产生重大影响。调查始于2022年9月的以太坊向股权证明模型的过渡后，SEC可能认为这一变化可能加强了以太坊作为证券的可能性。不确定性也影响着加密货币行业的其他方面，包括机构投资和以太期货市场。SEC对以太坊的分类决定将对整个加密货币市场产生深远影响。 <div>
<p>The status of Ethereum, the world&#8217;s second-largest cryptocurrency, is shrouded in uncertainty as the US Securities and Exchange Commission probes the Ethereum Foundation.</p>
<p>Industry insiders believe the investigation is aimed at classifying Ether (ETH), Ethereum&#8217;s native token, as a security, a move that could significantly impact the cryptocurrency market.</p>

<h2><strong>Ethereum&#8217;s Regulatory Landscape: Recent Developments</strong></h2>
<p>This development comes amidst a flurry of activity surrounding Ethereum. Major financial institutions like BlackRock and Fidelity have applied for spot Ether ETFs, while the controversial firm Prometheum seeks to offer Ether custody under SEC oversight. However, the SEC&#8217;s recent actions cast a shadow over these efforts.</p>
<p>Companies subpoenaed by the SEC have disclosed that the investigation began shortly after Ethereum&#8217;s transition to a proof-of-stake model in September 2022.</p>
<p>The SEC, according to a<a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/03/20/sec-gary-gensler-ethereum-security-commodity-crypto-foundation/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> report by Fortune,</a> might view this shift as strengthening the case for Ether being a security, as proof-of-stake involves users staking their coins to validate transactions, potentially resembling an investment contract.</p>
<p>The SEC&#8217;s stance on <a href="https://qz.com/sec-ether-security-crypto-regulation-1851353565" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Ethereum&#8217;s classification</a> has been historically ambiguous. In 2018, then-Director of Corporation Finance William Hinman declared Ether wasn&#8217;t a security. However, the agency&#8217;s current Chair, Gary Gensler, has expressed a more skeptical view. He has suggested proof-of-stake tokens could be securities, though he&#8217;s avoided directly mentioning Ethereum.</p>
<p>Adding to the confusion, the SEC approved several Bitcoin futures ETFs in January 2023, while the CFTC (Commodity Futures Trading Commission) oversees Ether futures markets. This seemingly contradictory approach suggests the SEC might have a different view on Bitcoin and Ether.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/OVKEPuij/" width="1835" /></p>

<h2><strong>Implications of Ether&#8217;s Security Classification</strong></h2>
<p>Further muddying the waters is Prometheum&#8217;s move. This firm, already approved as a special purpose broker-dealer, plans to offer Ether custody as a security. Some speculate this could be a strategic maneuver to influence the SEC&#8217;s decision, potentially acting as a &#8220;Trojan Horse&#8221; for security classification.</p>
<p>The investigation&#8217;s outcome has major implications. Classifying<a href="https://www.binance.com/en/square/post/2024-03-21-sec-investigates-ethereum-classification-as-security-5677499263385" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> Ether as a security</a> would subject it to stricter regulations, potentially hindering its growth and impacting existing Ether futures markets. Additionally, it could discourage the approval of spot Ether ETFs, a major blow to institutional adoption.</p>
<p>The situation highlights the ongoing regulatory uncertainty surrounding cryptocurrencies. The SEC&#8217;s aggressive approach under Gensler appears aimed at exerting greater control over the industry. However, the lack of clear communication and potential inconsistencies within the SEC itself create confusion and hinder innovation.</p>

<p>The coming months will be crucial for Ethereum. The SEC&#8217;s investigation and its ultimate decision on Ether&#8217;s classification will have ripple effects throughout the cryptocurrency market. Investors and industry players eagerly await clarity, hoping for a regulatory framework that fosters responsible development within the crypto ecosystem.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Tokenization is at the heart of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-private-bitcoin-event/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">BlackRock&#8217;s digital asset strategy</a>, with BUIDL enabling the issuance and trading of ownership on the Ethereum blockchain. This approach not only widens access to on-chain offerings but also ensures instantaneous and transparent settlement, along with interoperability across platforms, courtesy of BNY Mellon.</p>

<p>Carlos Domingo, co-founder and CEO of Securitize, emphasized the transformative potential of tokenization in capital markets, noting, &#8220;Today’s news demonstrates that traditional financial products are being made more accessible through digitization.&#8221;</p>
<p>BUIDL is designed to maintain a stable value of $1 per token, distributing daily accrued dividends directly to investors&#8217; wallets as new tokens each month. The fund primarily invests in cash, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/tether-72-5-billion-in-treaury-bills-investement/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">US Treasury bills</a>, and repurchase agreements, ensuring a secure yield for token holders on the blockchain.</p>
<p>Moreover, the ecosystem for BUIDL includes prestigious names like Anchorage Digital Bank NA, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitgo-ceo-coinbase-major-obstacle-bitcoin-etf/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">BitGo</a>, Coinbase, and Fireblocks, setting a solid foundation for the fund&#8217;s operations.</p>
<p>The strategic collaboration extends beyond product launch, with BlackRock making a strategic investment in Securitize and appointing Joseph Chalom, its Global Head of Strategic Ecosystem Partnerships, to Securitize’s Board of Directors.</p>

<p>This initiative represents a critical juncture in the evolution of digital assets, signaling the increasing integration of blockchain technology with traditional financial instruments. The fund&#8217;s tokenized structure offers a glimpse into the future of investment, where accessibility, transparency, and efficiency reign supreme.</p>
<h2>Ethereum Community Rejoices Euphorically</h2>
<p>Reactions from the Ethereum community have been overwhelmingly positive, with industry figures like Anthony Sassano and Ryan Berckmans citing the launch as a bullish signal for both Ethereum and the broader crypto market.</p>
<p>Sassano, founder of the The Daily Gwei, <a href="https://twitter.com/sassal0x/status/1770613618423587232" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">remarked</a>, &#8220;BlackRock launching a yield-bearing stablecoin on Ethereum is still one of the most bullish things to ever happen in crypto and the market has definitely not digested this yet,&#8221; underscoring the significant impact of such a move.</p>
<p>Ryan Berckmans <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanberckmans/status/1770606156337008788" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">stated</a>, “BUIDL seeks to offer a stable value of $1 per token and pays daily accrued dividends directly to investors&#8217; wallets as new tokens each month. I hadn&#8217;t realized that BlackRock launched *a yield-bearing stablecoin* on ETH. Yield-bearing stables are apex products. Very bullish.”</p>
<p>Seraphim Czecker, head of growth at Ethena Labs <a href="https://twitter.com/MacroMate8/status/1770717598663016660" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">added</a> his excitement, stating, “Freaking Blackrock launched a yield bearing stablecoin and you’re not bullish on crypto. We have come a long way.”</p>
<p>At press time, ETH traded at $3,549.</p>

<title>Cardano Luminary Foresees Technological Revolution By 2030</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-luminary-hoskinson-foresees-technological-revolution-by-2030/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-luminary-hoskinson-foresees-technological-revolution-by-2030/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章探讨了Charles Hoskinson对未来PC游戏能力的大胆预测，预计到2030年，游戏PC将能够比当前最强大的超级计算机快1000倍运行模型。文章还讨论了Cardano加密货币在游戏中的潜在影响，以及Web3游戏中的关键挑战和失败率。最后，文章提出了游戏行业未来的可能发展方向，强调游戏体验的重要性。 <div>
<p>In the ever-evolving world of gaming, the horizon seems to be expanding at an exponential rate, promising groundbreaking advancements that might redefine the very essence of gaming itself.</p>
<p>Charles Hoskinson, the mastermind behind the Cardano blockchain platform, has stirred up a storm of speculation among gamers with his audacious prophecy: the future of PC gaming might just eclipse the capabilities of today&#8217;s most powerful supercomputers.</p>

<h2><strong>Cardano Visionary&#8217;s Bold Prediction</strong></h2>
<p>This bold prediction has sparked a discourse around the potential trajectory of computing power and its implications for the gaming landscape.</p>
<p>Hoskinson envisions a future, perhaps as soon as 2030, where optimized hardware and cutting-edge models will catapult gaming experiences into uncharted territories.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Here&#8217;s my prediction, by 2030 we will be able to run a model 1000x more power than Mixtral on a gaming PC due to specialized hardware and model optimization</p>
<p>— Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles) <a href="https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1770414805788078439?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">March 20, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>The prospect of running computations at speeds a thousand times faster than current capabilities is tantalizing, suggesting a realm where hyper-realistic graphics, intricate physics simulations, and AI adversaries that learn and adapt in real-time become the norm rather than the exception. It&#8217;s a vision that holds the promise of immersive experiences previously only dreamed of.</p>
<p>However, amidst the excitement, skepticism looms large. Can such a grandiose vision materialize into reality, or is it merely an elusive fantasy?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/1PgUAk7T/" width="1835" /></p>

<p>While tech enthusiasts like Kurt, hailing from Sydney, lend credence to Hoskinson&#8217;s vision, citing the relentless march of progress in graphics technology, others remain cautious, wary of potential pitfalls on the road to technological utopia.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I agree &#8211; the AI bubble won&#8217;t be with AI software; it will be with the hardware. These models are already becoming so efficient. Just look at image generation in the last 24 months. It is continuously getting better, and I am still running the exact same 2080ti, and it&#8217;s only…</p>

<p></p>
<h2><strong>Cardano: Influence On The Future of Gaming</strong></h2>
<p>The conversation takes an intriguing turn as cryptocurrency enters the fray. Some Cardano investors propose the integration of ADA, Cardano&#8217;s native token, into popular titles like Call of Duty for in-game purchases.</p>
<p>The notion of earning cryptocurrency through gameplay adds a new layer of intrigue to the discussion. Yet, amidst the allure of digital currencies, questions arise about the feasibility and implications of such integration within mainstream gaming.</p>
<p>This leads us to a sobering reality check: the landscape of Web3 gaming, often dubbed &#8220;GameFi,&#8221; is fraught with challenges. Reports indicate a staggering 76% failure rate among emerging Web3 games launched in the past five years.</p>
<p>The emphasis on the &#8220;play-to-earn&#8221; model, prioritizing cryptocurrency-driven revenue over compelling gameplay experiences, appears to be a significant contributing factor to this high failure rate.</p>
<strong>Cardano And Gaming: What Lies Ahead?</strong>
<p>So, what lies ahead for the future of gaming? The tantalizing prospect of unprecedented processing power holds the promise of transcendent gaming experiences.</p>

<p>Yet, the success of crypto integration within mainstream gaming hinges on a delicate balance between innovation and preservation, where engaging gameplay takes precedence over financial gains.</p>
<p>As the gaming industry navigates these uncharted waters, the stewardship of tech luminaries like Hoskinson ensures that the soul of gaming endures, even in the face of technological upheaval.</p>

<title>Ethereum Is Not A Security, SEC Probe Unlikely To Succeed: A16z</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-not-security-sec-probe-a16z/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的<br />瑞士以太坊基金会收到了一份“自愿询问”的询问，要求保密。福布斯的报道称，美国证券交易委员会（SEC）正在对以太坊基金会进行调查，特别是在以太坊从PoW过渡到PoS模型后。A16z的布赖恩·昆滕兹反对SEC的调查，并指出以太坊应被视为商品而非证券。Coinbase首席法律官保罗·格雷瓦尔也支持以太坊被分类为商品，而不是证券的立场。 ETH目前的价格为$3507。 <div>
<p>The crypto industry finds itself at a pivotal juncture as the Swiss Ethereum Foundation received a &#8220;voluntary enquiry&#8221; from an undisclosed &#8220;state authority&#8221; which demanded confidentiality, as Bitcoinist reported yesterday. This revelation, made through the removal of the Warrant Canary from its website and a note in a Github repository, marks a first in the foundation&#8217;s history.</p>
<p>A little later, a <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/03/20/sec-gary-gensler-ethereum-security-commodity-crypto-foundation/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">report</a> by Forbes surfaced, claiming that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is the agency, trying to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/vitalik-buterin-claps-back-at-the-ethereum-is-a-security-argument/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">declare ETH as a security</a>. This action comes in the wake of the SEC&#8217;s approval of Bitcoin ETFs in January and the looming mid-May deadline for spot ETH Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs).</p>
<p>The SEC&#8217;s inquiry seeks extensive documentation from US companies on their interactions with the Ethereum Foundation, particularly after Ethereum&#8217;s <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/talking-heads-proof-of-stake-ethereum/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">transition to a Proof of Stake (PoS) </a>model. Seemingly, the SEC&#8217;s probe of the Ethereum Foundation aims to categorize Ether as a security, particularly after Ethereum&#8217;s transition to a PoS in September 2022.</p>
<h2>A16z SEC&#8217;s Security Probe Into Ethereum</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://twitter.com/BrianQuintenz/status/1770541125847416943" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">response</a> to the SEC’s actions, Brian Quintenz, Global Head of Policy at Andreessen Horowitz (A16z), a leading venture capital firm with significant investments in the crypto space and $35 billion assets under management, has vocally opposed the SEC&#8217;s attempt. Quintenz, through a series of statements on X (formerly Twitter), laid out a cogent argument against the SEC&#8217;s probe.</p>

<p>Quintenz stated, &#8220;Reminder: When the SEC allowed ETH Futures ETFs to trade on its regulated security exchanges, it explicitly acknowledged the status of the underlying, ETH, as being a non-security and outside of its jurisdiction.&#8221;</p>
<p>He further elaborated on the significance of the SEC&#8217;s decision post-Ethereum&#8217;s transition to a proof-of-stake (PoS) model, saying, &#8220;Importantly, this [futures] ETF approval decision in October 2023 occurred well after Ethereum changed to PoS in Sept of 2022; meaning that to the SEC, ETH, in its present state as of Oct 2023, was not a security.&#8221;</p>
<p>Quintenz argues that any doubts regarding Ethereum&#8217;s regulatory treatment should have been resolved with the futures ETF approval, indicating a clear stance from the SEC that Ethereum does not fall under its jurisdiction as a security.</p>

<p>Highlighting the potential contradictions in the SEC&#8217;s approach, Quintenz pointed out, &#8220;If the SEC had any doubt about the regulatory treatment of ETH in Oct 2023, it wouldn’t have approved the ETF. If ETH were in fact a security, then the CFTC-listed futures contracts (on which the ETFs were based) would be illegal, as any derivative on ETH would be considered security futures contracts and subject to different rules, listed on different exchanges and subject to joint SEC/CFTC jurisdiction.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Coinbase CLO Weighs In</h2>
<p>Echoing Quintenz&#8217;s sentiments, Paul Grewal, Coinbase Chief Legal Officer (CLO), reinforced Ethereum&#8217;s classification as a commodity rather than a security. Grewal took to X, articulating, &#8220;Millions of Americans hold ETH; it has been vital to crypto since its 2015 launch; and ETH is a commodity, not a security.&#8221;</p>
<p>He backed his argument with references to previous statements by SEC officials and the consistent position of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and federal courts. Notably, Grewal argued, &#8220;Ex. C. And even very recently, the SEC’s trial lawyers continue to compare ETH to BTC,&#8221; indicating a longstanding regulatory perspective that diverges from the current SEC probe.</p>
<p>The crux of the argument against Ethereum&#8217;s classification as a security lies in the application of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/us-congress-grills-yellen-on-crypto-regulation/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Howey Test</a>, a legal standard used to determine whether certain transactions qualify as investment contracts. Grewal contended, &#8220;Even if we were to apply Howey, ETH utterly fails that test, and nothing about the merge changes that conclusion.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Sigh&#8230; again with the ETH misinformation as we await a decision on ETH ETPs. Ok&#8211;let’s talk about some basic facts about Ethereum. Millions of Americans hold ETH; it has been vital to crypto since its 2015 launch; and ETH is a commodity, not a security. 1/10</p>

<title>The Billion-Dollar Bitcoin Clean-Up: How A UK Woman Laundered $6B From A Chinese Fraud Scheme</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/the-billion-dollar-bitcoin-clean-up-how-a-uk-woman/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。<br />伦敦一起案件揭示了一名英国女子涉嫌洗钱比特币，与一起价值近60亿美元的中国诈骗案有关。42岁的简雯被判洗钱罪，牵涉到隐藏来自中国逃犯的资金，引起了执法机构的关注。审判揭示了洗钱操作的复杂性，以及简雯的生活方式迅速变化，而比特币的价值也出现了下降。 <div>
<p>In a case unraveling in London, a jury has <a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/uk-woman-guilty-of-laundering-bitcoin-linked-to-6-billion-china-fraud-1.2049417" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">convicted</a> a UK woman of laundering Bitcoin connected to an extensive fraud scheme originating from China, valued at nearly $6 billion.</p>
<p>The case, which has captured the attention of law enforcement, sheds light on the methods criminals use to exploit digital currencies for illicit activities.</p>

<h2>The Verdict And Its Implications</h2>
<p>42-year-old British citizen Jian Wen was implicated in facilitating the concealment of funds for a Chinese national, identified as a &#8220;fugitive&#8221; responsible for &#8220;orchestrating&#8221; a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-laundering-north-korean-tornado-cash/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">massive investment fraud</a> of nearly $6 billion.</p>
<p>From 2017 to 2022, Wen played a critical role in this operation, which has now been brought to light following an investigation by the London police.</p>
<p>The seizure of more than £1.7 billion ($2.2 billion) in <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-see-more-pullback-think-quant-explains-why/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin</a> in 2018 from a residence shared by Wen and the accused &#8220;mastermind,&#8221; Zhimin Qian, marked a significant milestone in the case, highlighting the scale of the illicit activities.</p>
<p>After an exhaustive trial, the jury found Jian Wen guilty of one count of money laundering while remaining undecided on two additional charges. The Crown Prosecution Service has decided not to seek a retrial for the unresolved charges, focusing instead on the significant conviction already achieved.</p>
<p>Wen, who consistently denied any wrongdoing, argued through her defense that she was unaware of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/tether-usdts-role-in-money-laundering-on-the-rise/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">fraudulent origins</a> of the funds she handled. Her sentencing is scheduled for May 10.</p>
<h2>A Web Of Bitcoin Fraud And Luxury</h2>
<p>The trial exposed the intricacies of the money laundering operation and the rapid transformation in Wen&#8217;s lifestyle, which raised eyebrows. Once working at a fast-food takeaway, Wen&#8217;s association with Zhimin Qian catapulted her into a world of luxury, marked by abundant living and international travel, a stark contrast to her previous life.</p>
<p>This lifestyle shift, fuelled by the proceeds of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-firms-now-included-in-ebas-latest-aml/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">fraudulent scheme</a>, served as a key piece of evidence for understanding the depth of the operation. Zhimin Qian, described as a &#8220;supervillain,&#8221; successfully misled approximately 130,000 investors through a complex network of investment vehicles and offices across China.</p>
<p>The trial revealed the extensive network of &#8220;intermediaries and professionals&#8221; that facilitated the laundering of Bitcoin, allowing the acquisition of assets across the UK, Europe, and Dubai. London’s Metropolitan Police Service hailed the verdict as a significant disruption to a &#8220;sophisticated economic crime operation,&#8221; emphasizing the role of cryptocurrencies in <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-under-fire-latest-exchange-charged-scandal/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">modern financial crimes</a>.</p>

<p>Speaking of Bitcoin, the asset has exhibited a downward trend, with its value decreasing by nearly 1% on the last day alone. Currently, its price is just over $63,000 as market participants await key policy decisions from the US Federal Reserve.</p>

<title>No Apologies: 3AC Co-Founder ‘Not Sorry’ For Crypto Hedge Fund Bankruptcy</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/no-apologies-3ac-co-founder-not-sorry-for-crypto-hedge-fund-bankruptcy/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/no-apologies-3ac-co-founder-not-sorry-for-crypto-hedge-fund-bankruptcy/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的<br />Kyle Davies, 3AC的共同创始人之一，在Unchained Podcast中讨论了加密社区对他的看法，解释了为什么他不后悔两年前这家加密对冲基金的破产，以及他的监禁。他在新加坡逃避四个月的监禁，坚称不打算立即返回。他对公司破产不感到抱歉，认为解决问题的关键是如何建设未来。他和另一位创始人苏朱可能成为面对类似问题的公司的顾问。 <div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Kyle Davies, the co-founder of the now-bankrupt Three Arrows Capital (3AC), recently joined the Unchained Podcast to discuss the crypto community’s opinion of him, why he isn’t sorry that the crypto hedge fund went bankrupt two years ago, and his prison sentence.</p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Where On Earth Is Kyle Davies?</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In 2022, 3AC was one of the giants in the industry. The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/inside-the-three-arrows-capital-3ac-collapse/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">now-failed</a> crypto hedge fund saw its collapse shortly after Terra’s crash, which sent the whole crypto market into turmoil.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Since then, Kyle Davies and Su Zhu, 3AC’s founders, have faced legal repercussions and massive public scrutiny. Both founders were sentenced to four months of imprisonment after failing to cooperate with authorities in the 3AC’s bankruptcy investigation.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">After Zhu’s apprehension, Davies refused to turn himself in to Singaporean authorities, and he remained at large. In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEsjWV7GRgY&amp;t=240s" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">interview</a> with Laura Shin for the Unchained Podcast, the co-founder shed some light on his decision to avoid the four-month sentence.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">According to Davies, Su Zhu’s <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/three-arrows-capital-founder-4-month-jail-sentence/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">detention</a> took both by surprise as allegedly neither of them knew about the missed court date that led to their sentencing. Their lawyer is seemingly at fault for not informing them of the court date.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, Zhu’s experience in prison was not what Davies expected it to be, as he took the time to “meditate and help others.” Despite not being like “in the movies,” the fugitive co-founder doesn’t plan to return to Singapore soon unless authorities “remove the contempt.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">However, Davies is hopeful that a settlement can be reached with Singapore authorities:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I’m not going to go back immediately. But obviously, these things just resolve at some point. There are settlements. These are common kinds of tactics. So, I’ve learned where people try to pressure for this or pressure that settlement or whatever. But at the end of the day, all these things resolve.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The 3AC’s co-founder also believes that his entrance to the US shouldn’t be a problem despite his resigning from his American citizenship. Nevertheless, Davies didn’t disclose his current location beyond affirming that he was somewhere in Europe. He considers that giving his exact location “would be problematic.”</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">No Apologies For The Crypto Community</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">During the interview, Shin asked about the crypto community’s opinion regarding Davies’s lack of visible “remorse.” The co-founder addressed his “reputation,” refusing to apologize for the crypto hedge fund’s collapse:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Am I sorry for a company going bankrupt? No, like companies go bankrupt, almost every company goes bankrupt, right?</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Davies stated that instead of focusing on the mistakes already made, what matters is “how you build or what you do about it.” He claims that most people who had something negative to say about him or 3AC’s bankruptcy were “largely people who are not affected.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Nevertheless, Zhu and Davies could serve as an example and as advisors for the firms that face similar <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/creditors-rejoice-as-worldcoin-wld-skyrockets-188/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">challenges</a> that 3AC did, according to Davies:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We’re definitely trying our best. We can add value in various ways. At a minimum, we can even tell the next Three Arrows how to do things better when they go bankrupt.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Spot ETFs Hits $150 Billion Trading Volume Milestone Amid Market Mayhem — What’s Next?</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。美国现货比特币交易所交易基金（ETF）累计交易量突破1500亿美元，仅不到三个月时间。然而，尽管取得里程碑，市场仍面临挑战，昨日比特币价格下跌，创下纪录的净流出。交易量增加，但市场动态发生变化，市场份额出现挤压现象。流出超过32.62亿美元，比之前纪录高出一倍，暴露市场的波动性。对ETF的流动性进行了批评，指出其只能在美国市场营业时间内交易，导致投资者无法在夜间市场波动时卖出持仓。 <div>
<p>As of the latest data, the US spot Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) have <a href="https://www.theblock.co/data/crypto-markets/bitcoin-etf/bitcoin-spot-etf-volumes" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">surged</a> past a notable milestone, with cumulative trading volume breaching the $150 billion mark on March 19.</p>
<p>This development is particularly noteworthy considering the spot <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/vanguard-ceo-double-down-on-anti-bitcoin-etf-stance/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">ETFs</a>&#8216; relatively short period in the market, following their approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) less than three months ago.</p>
<p>However, despite this milestone, the market has not been without its challenges. Record net outflows were also observed amid a notable dip in Bitcoin&#8217;s price yesterday.</p>

<h2>Record Trading Volumes And Market Dynamics</h2>
<p>The achievement of surpassing $150 billion in cumulative trading volumes for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/jim-bianco-backs-vanguard-on-bitcoin-etfs-decision/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">US spot BTC ETFs</a> reflects a significant interest and participation in the cryptocurrency market. Notably, a substantial portion of this volume was recorded in a relatively short span, with $50 billion added since March 8 alone.</p>
<p>Additionally, yesterday alone, trading volumes reached $5.6 billion, led by BlackRock&#8217;s IBIT, Grayscale&#8217;s GBTC, and Fidelity&#8217;s FBTC, highlighting the active engagement of investors with these financial instruments.</p>
<img alt="Bitcoin Spot ETF Volume" class="wp-image-288530 size-large" height="276" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot-2024-03-20-at-16.33.39.png?resize=980%2C276" width="980" />
<p>However, this enthusiasm has been tempered by a significant market shift, with Grayscale&#8217;s GBTC experiencing a &#8220;squeeze&#8221; in market share amid daily outflows.</p>
<p>Conversely, BlackRock&#8217;s IBIT has emerged as a primary beneficiary, witnessing a substantial increase in market share from 22.1% as of inception to 45.2%.</p>

<h2>Record Bitcoin Spot ETFs Outflows And Vulnerabilities</h2>
<p>The cryptocurrency market&#8217;s inherent volatility was underscored by the net outflow of $326.2 million from US spot<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/how-are-hong-kong-firms-preparing-for-spot-bitcoin-etfs-osl-exec-shares-details/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> Bitcoin ETFs</a>, which more than doubled the previous record of $158.4 million set earlier in the year.</p>

<p>Amid this development, Peter Schiff has critiqued spot Bitcoin ETFs, highlighting a significant drawback: their liquidity is confined to the operational hours of the US market.</p>

<p>Schiff highlighted that this limitation means that in the event of a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-see-more-pullback-think-quant-explains-why/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">market downturn</a> outside these hours, investors cannot sell their holdings until the US market resumes trading, leaving them in a &#8220;helpless&#8221; position to react to overnight market movements.</p>

So if the market crashes overnight, you have no ability to sell until the U.S. market opens for trading in the morning. Very frustrating to watch helplessly with no ability to get out.</p>

<title>Goldman Sachs Remains Bullish On Bitcoin Despite 18% Price Dip: Key Reasons Why</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/goldman-sachs-remains-bullish-on-bitcoin/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/goldman-sachs-remains-bullish-on-bitcoin/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章提到，零售投资者一直是比特币和加密货币价格上涨的主要推动力，但机构投资者正在逐渐进入市场。高盛的数字资产负责人指出，机构投资者参与将为加密货币市场带来额外的流动性、稳定性和可信度。虽然比特币价格最近有所下降，但机构投资者的参与和加密货币ETF的推出被认为是重要的推动因素。金融机构对区块链技术的潜力也表达了乐观态度，认为这种技术不仅可以应用于加密货币，还可以对其他资产进行交易。 <div>
<p>Retail investors have been the primary driving force in the recent rise of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency prices in general. However, institutional investors are now beginning to enter the market, according to Mathew McDermott, the head of digital assets at <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/goldman-sachs-eyes-participant-role-bitcoin-etfs/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Goldman Sachs</a>. </p>
<h2>Bitcoin Rally Cools Down </h2>
<p>Speaking at the Digital Asset Summit (DAS) conference in London, McDermott <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/goldman-sachs-digital-asset-head-says-crypto-rally-driven-by-retail-investors-2024-03-19/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">noted </a>that while retail investors have been the main drivers of the price action, there is a noticeable shift as institutions increasingly show interest and participation in the cryptocurrency market, reflecting the growing acceptance and recognition of cryptocurrencies as a legitimate asset class.</p>
<p>McDermott highlighted significant changes witnessed this year regarding the types of clients and the trading volumes. The involvement of institutional investors is seen as a significant development for the cryptocurrency market, as it brings additional liquidity, stability, and credibility.</p>

<p>While the exact factors driving Bitcoin&#8217;s recent price gains remain uncertain, the launch of US spot Bitcoin <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bleed-grayscale-ceo/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">exchange-traded funds</a> (ETFs) this year has been identified as a notable catalyst. McDermott described the ETFs as causing a &#8220;psychological shift&#8221; in the market. </p>
<p>However, the rally in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has cooled off somewhat in recent days, with <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-see-more-pullback-think-quant-explains-why/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">BTC plunging</a> more than 18% to $60,900 on Tuesday, coinciding with a broader decline in riskier assets on signs that the Federal Reserve may not cut interest rates as much as previously expected.</p>
<h2>Optimism Amidst Crypto Market Challenges</h2>
<p>The cryptocurrency market experienced a notable boom during 2020 and 2021, fueled by ultra-low interest rates that encouraged speculative investments. However, this period was followed by a sharp downturn in 2022, with several high-profile crypto-related failures and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/tornado-cash-founder-charged-for-allegedly-aiding-1-2-billion-in-laundered-funds/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">bankruptcies</a>, including FTX, resulting in significant losses for investors. </p>
<p>McDermott mentioned that Goldman Sachs has examined bankruptcy claims and explored other investment opportunities in this context.</p>
<p>Regulators have consistently warned about the high risks of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, emphasizing their limited real-world utility. McDermott acknowledged that there is currently some leverage in the system, but he expressed that it is not at the same level of “hyperbole” as in previous years.</p>

<p>In addition to their interest in cryptocurrencies, various banks, including Goldman Sachs, have recognized the potential of blockchain technology that underlies these digital assets. They believe <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/can-solana-exist-without-layer-2s/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">blockchain technology</a> could be applied to trade other assets beyond cryptocurrencies. </p>
<p>Pilot projects exploring tokenizing traditional financial assets, such as bonds, have been initiated. Still, the routine issuance and establishment of a liquid secondary market have yet to be realized.</p>
<p>Ultimately, McDermott expressed optimism about the future, stating that he expects to witness the tokenization of more asset classes and the development of scalable solutions in the next few years. This suggests that adopting and integrating blockchain technology in traditional financial systems may accelerate, providing new opportunities.</p>
<img alt="Bitcoin" class="size-large" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/ZtZjJcZe/" width="1815" />
<p>Despite the market downturn, as of this writing, bitcoin has climbed back to the $64,000 mark, showing increased volatility in recent days. </p>

<title>Dogecoin Days Are Over: Shiba Inu Team Hints At Major Updates</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-shiba-inu-updates/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-shiba-inu-updates/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />Shiba Inu团队暗示将进行重大更新，可能超越Dogecoin。Lucie透露了Shiba Inu虚拟世界的创新计划，暗示Metaverse的进一步发展。Shib的Metaverse已实现几个里程碑，同时还计划推出TREAT代币作为Metaverse计划的一部分。团队声称Shiba Inu生态系统正经历巨变，可能使其在市场上更加稳固地占据地位。 <div>
<p><a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-team-next-big-thing-big-money-shib/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">The Shiba Inu team</a> has dropped hints about significant updates set to take place within the<a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-ecosystem-soars-shibarium-hits-crucial-milestone/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> ecosystem</a> that could see it overtake Dogecoin. This announcement comes amid SHIB’s impressive market performance recently, positioning the digital asset as a formidable contender to prominent cryptocurrencies like <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-dogecoin-killer/">Dogecoin</a>. </p>
<h2>Shiba Inu Team Teases Game-Changing Updates</h2>
<p>In a recent X (formerly Twitter) post, popular Shiba Inu marketing influencer, Lucie <a href="https://x.com/lucieshib/status/1769275410536169833?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">teased</a> about upcoming plans set to launch in Shiba Inu’s virtual world, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-goes-virtual/">Shib The Metaverse.</a> According to Lucie, the Shib team has put in place innovative plans for the virtual world, potentially aiming to further develop and improve the highly anticipated Metaverse. </p>

<p>Previously speculated to launch by the end of 2023, Shiba Inu’s metaverse remains unreleased, as the Shib team continues to keep the official release date under wraps. Nonetheless, indications of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-to-introduce-four-new-metaverse-hubs-in-2023/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">ongoing progress and developments within the metaverse</a> persist, as evident in Lucie’s recent announcement of upcoming updates. </p>
<p>While the team is still working towards a potential launch, the Shib Metaversers has already achieved several milestones, opening land bids via its website and publicizing the Metaverse through its official X account.  </p>
<p>In addition to Lucie’s remarks about the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-lead-game-changing/">upcoming updates</a> for the SHIB Metaverse, the Shiba Inu influencer has disclosed that one of its ecosystem’s soon-to-be-launched tokens, TREAT, would become an integral part of the Metaverse plans. </p>
<p>According to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-investing-meme-coins/">Lucie</a>, SHIB’s solution powered by Zama will run on Treat, providing liquidity to Shiba Inu’s stablecoin, SHI. Additionally, the TREAT token <a href="https://x.com/lucieshib/status/1763338921738477998?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">will serve as a reward</a> to individuals in SHIB The Metaverse. </p>
<h2>SHIB Set To Overtake Dogecoin?</h2>
<p>In a bold statement <a href="https://x.com/shibtoken/status/1770248051254338034?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">released</a> via SHIB’s official X account, the Shiba Inu team has declared the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/forget-dogecoin-shiba-inu-set-to-become-the-top-dog-expert-predicts-100-billion-market-cap/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">demise of Dogecoin’s reign</a> in the cryptocurrency space. According to the team, the Shiba Inu ecosystem is currently brimming with <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-project-timelines-shib-price/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">upcoming projects</a> that could potentially transform the ecosystem and further solidify the cryptocurrency’s position in the market. </p>
<p>While the team has stated that specifics regarding the updates remain undisclosed, they have issued a compelling message to the broader cryptocurrency community: “Get ready for a new top doggo.”</p>

<p>Sharing a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-shibarium-milestone/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">recent milestone</a> achieved by the popular cryptocurrency, the SHIB team declared that “Dogecoin’s days were numbered,” emphasizing SHIB’s <a href="https://x.com/cryptocom/status/1770208635882295414?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ascent</a> to the position of the second-largest meme coin by market capitalization. The cryptocurrency has been <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-lead-dev-shib-bull/">steadily gaining ground</a> against its primary rival, Dogecoin, experiencing substantial price rallies and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-surge-in-interest/">heightened interest</a> from investors and traders. </p>
<p>With more updates potentially set to take effect within the ecosystem, Shiba Inu could see its value <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-dogecoin-shib-excitement/">surpassing Dogecoin’s. </a>However, the optimistic outlook is yet to be confirmed, as SHIB is currently trading at $ 0.000025, and <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/can-doge-avoid-a-dive-sell-pressure-puts-memecoin-to-the-test/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">DOGE</a> at $0.13, according to CoinMarketCap.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Liquidity Exploding, The “Alameda Gap” Is No More</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-liquidity-exploding-alameda-gap-no-more/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-liquidity-exploding-alameda-gap-no-more/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章指出，比特币在3月19日价格下跌至61500美元，但随着货币恢复，主要加密货币交易所的流动性一直在稳步恢复。现在，比特币市场流动性高于“阿拉米达差距”，这对交易员来说是一大利好。文章解释了流动性对比特币和加密货币交易的重要性，并指出了导致流动性恢复的几个因素，包括比特币价格上涨和主要交易所的交易价差收窄。文章还提到，比特币半减产事件即将发生，预计会进一步提高流动性。 <div>
<p>On March 19, Bitcoin prices fell to as low as $61,500. However, even as fear reigned, Kaiko, a blockchain analytics platform, <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/KaikoData/status/1770393602910527792" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">observed</a> that the coin&#8217;s liquidity across major crypto exchanges, including Binance and Coinbase, has been recovering steadily. </p>
<p>When writing, the Bitcoin market liquidity is above the &#8220;Alameda Gap,&#8221; a massive boost for traders, including those looking to double down ahead of Bitcoin halving. </p>
<h2>Bitcoin Liquidity Jumps Above The &#8220;Alameda Gap&#8221;</h2>
<p>Liquidity is crucial in Bitcoin and crypto trading in general. It simply refers to how easy it is to convert fiat to crypto or crypto to fiat without impacting price. The higher the liquidity, the easier to trade and receive assets at a fair price.</p>

<p>Over the past two years, since the collapse of FTX, the popular crypto exchange, and its investment arm, Alameda Research, there has been a notable liquidity drop across the crypto trading scene, especially in Bitcoin. The observation, dubbed the &#8220;Alameda Gap,&#8221; negatively impacted liquidity and, by extension, market stability.</p>
<img alt="BTC liquidity improving | Source: Kaiko" class="size-full wp-image-288513" height="597" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GJGzmVFasAAmRbI.png?resize=1024%2C597" width="1024" />
<p>Fortunately, recent data from Kaiko paints a much brighter picture. In their latest report, the Bitcoin 2% market depth, a key liquidity indicator that measures the depth of the market by showing the volume of buy and sell orders within 2% of the current price, has fully recovered. Most importantly, it is now at the pre-FTX average of $470 million, pointing to renewed confidence in the Bitcoin secondary market.</p>
<h2>Rising Prices, Tight Spread Drivers Of Liquidity</h2>
<p>In their analysis, Kaiko pointed the refreshing bounce to multiple factors. At the top of the list, the analytics platform said the recent surge in Bitcoin prices has played a crucial role. Bitcoin is currently trading above $64,000 when writing. </p>
<p>However, in March, prices soared to as high as $73,800. The spike follows the approval of several spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in January. </p>

<p>Moreover, Kaiko added that tight Bitcoin trading spreads on major exchanges like <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/paradigm-industry-titans-rallying-behind-coinbase/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Coinbase</a>, Kraken, and Bitstamp deepened the overall market liquidity. Usually, the higher the liquidity, the tighter the bid-ask spread becomes. This development suggests that more people keep trading and engaging with the market.</p>
<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/x/oAbcSmXX/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Bitcoin price trending downward on the daily chart | Source: BTCUSDT on Binance, TradingView" class="size-full" height="904" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/oAbcSmXX/" width="1787" /></a>
<p>It is yet to be seen whether Bitcoin&#8217;s liquidity will increase ahead of the highly anticipated halving. The event, set for mid-April, halves miner rewards but will make the coin scarcer. Rising prices, expected after halving, will likely draw more people, further deepening liquidity.</p>

<title>Shiba Inu’s Shibarium Sees Staggering 99% Decline In Transactions, What’s Happening?</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shibarium-99-decline/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shibarium-99-decline/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。<br />比特币市场崩溃导致加密市场下跌，同时以太坊Layer 2网络Shibarium也受到重创。每日交易次数下降至不到1万笔，降至数月来的最低水平。Shiba Inu价格下跌也是一个原因，导致投资者等待价格回升。竞争激烈，如Solana与以太坊竞争最活跃用户。 <div>
<p class="p2">In addition to the Bitcoin crash that has brought down the crypto market, Shibarium, an Ethereum Layer 2 network developed by the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-surge-in-interest/">Shiba Inu team</a>, has taken a huge hit. This latest drawback comes in the form of a significant decline in the number of daily transactions being carried out on the network, leading to its lowest level in months.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Shibarium Daily Transactions Fall Below 10,000</h2>
<p class="p2">From the end of 2023 and into the new year of 2024, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shibarium-breaks-the-internet-again-with-over-400-million-layer-2-transactions/">Shibarium network</a> had been seeing a lot of adoption. This was embodied by a significant rise in the number of daily transactions that were being carried out on the network. It rose rapidly and crossed more than 7 million daily transactions in December 2023. And even after usage began to wane in the new year, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-takes-a-hit-amidst-shibarium-user-exodus/">Ethereum Layer 2 network</a> was still able to maintain an average of around 1 million transactions per day.</p>

<p class="p2">However, the network has entered into what seems to be an incredibly trying period with a notable crash in the number of daily transactions. This <a href="https://www.shibariumscan.io/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">decline</a> began on March 10 when the daily transaction figures fell below 1 million to 800,000 for the first time this year.</p>
<p class="p2">In the following days, the transaction count would pick up and cross 1 million again. But this was only short-lived as a bigger crash was on the horizon. March 16 was the last the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shibarium-breaks-the-internet-again-with-over-400-million-layer-2-transactions/">Shibarium network</a> saw daily transactions come in above 1 million as the count would crash to less than 600,000 the next day.</p>
<p class="p2">This decline would continue for the next few days and by Wednesday, March 30, the total daily transaction count on the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shibarium-new-project-dao-charter/">Shibarium network</a> was sitting at 9,330. The last time the daily transaction count on the network was this low was back in November 2023, which means that the transaction count has now fallen to its lowest level in four months.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Shiba Inu Price Decline To Blame?</h2>
<p class="p2">The decline in the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-price-down-today/">Shiba Inu price</a> over the last few days can be attributed to the Bitcoin crash, which saw the price go from $73,000 to below $61,000 in a matter of days. As a result, altcoins such as Shiba Inu have been suffering as well.</p>

<p class="p2">This <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-price-down-today/">crash in price</a> has seen investors reeling, with many not willing to gamble with their coins as they wait for prices to recover. This could explain the drastic drop in daily transactions on the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shibarium-new-record/">Shibarium network</a> as crypto users enter a period of waiting for what will happen next.</p>
<p class="p2">If this is the case, then a recovery in the price should trigger another wave of adoption for the layer 2 network. However, competition is also fierce as the likes of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-defi-tvl-rockets-80-impact-on-sol-price/">Solana</a> is taking on <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-price-reach-14000/">Ethereum</a> for the blockchain with the most active users.</p>

<title>Grayscale Outflows And Weak US Demand Result In Back-To-Back Negative Bitcoin ETF Flows</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/back-to-back-negative-bitcoin-etf-flows/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/back-to-back-negative-bitcoin-etf-flows/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是负面的。<br />比特币近期达到了历史最高价，但随后出现了显著回落，主要原因是Grayscale的Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC)的卖出行为增加以及美国证券交易委员会 (SEC)于1月10日对新投资工具的需求下降。最近两天，比特币ETF的资金流动为负，主要是由于美国市场的大规模赎回和对新ETF的需求减少。对于拥有比特币ETF的流动性可能存在挑战，因为当夜间市场崩溃时，投资者无法及时出售，无法买入。持有实际比特币的投资者可以更加灵活地进行交易。 <div>
<p>Bitcoin (BTC) recently achieved a significant milestone by reaching an all-time high (ATH) of $73,700 on March 14th. This surge was primarily attributed to the booming Bitcoin ETF market, which substantially impacted the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price. </p>
<p>However, following this new ATH, BTC has experienced a significant <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-slide-top-trader-provides-expert-analysis/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">price correction</a>, hitting a low of $60,900 on Tuesday, March 19th. The main factors contributing to this downturn are the increased selling activity of Grayscale&#8217;s Bitcoin Trust ETF (GBTC) and a decline in demand for the new investment vehicles <a href="http://BREAKING: Spot Bitcoin ETFs Approved By US SEC" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">approved</a> by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on January 10th.</p>
<h2>Days Of Negative Bitcoin ETF Flows</h2>
<p>James Butterfill, the head of research at CoinShares, shed light on the situation, <a href="https://x.com/jbutterfill/status/1770354905443709018?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">stating </a>that net Bitcoin ETF flows have been negative for two consecutive days. This negative trend results from heightened outflows from <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etf-fee-war-grayscale-ceo-says-gbtc-fees-will-drop-over-time/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Grayscale </a>and reduced demand for new ETFs in the United States, Butterfill remarked. </p>
<p>On March 19 alone, there was a <a href="https://x.com/WuBlockchain/status/1770311728636817816?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">net outflow</a> of $326 million from Bitcoin spot ETFs, with the outflows continuing for two days. Grayscale&#8217;s GBTC witnessed a single-day net outflow of $443 million. </p>

<img alt="Bitcoin ETF" class="wp-image-288501 size-large" height="439" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GJFo8SdaIAASpFm.png?w=559&#038;resize=559%2C439" width="559" />
<p>The only Bitcoin ETF to see net inflows on the day was BlackRock&#8217;s IBIT ETF, with a modest single-day <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-lawsuit-ripple-sec-agreement-schedule/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">net inflow</a> of $75.23 million. </p>
<p>It is worth noting that despite the lack of demand and record outflows in recent days, the total assets under management of the ten Bitcoin ETF issuers remain at a whopping $53.5 billion. </p>
<h2>The Liquidity Challenge</h2>
<p>Economist and global strategist <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/peter-schiff-questions-microstrategys-bitcoin-buys/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Peter Schiff</a> has raised concerns regarding the limited liquidity of Bitcoin held in an ETF. In a recent social media <a href="https://x.com/PeterSchiff/status/1770227134985895971?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, Schiff highlighted that owning Bitcoin through an ETF restricts liquidity to US market hours. </p>
<p>This means that if a market crash occurs overnight, investors cannot sell until the US market opens in the morning. Schiff expressed frustration at the inability to take action when needed.</p>
<p>A user responded to Schiff&#8217;s statement, interpreting it as an indication that holding Bitcoin ETFs would leave investors on the sidelines during a market crash, missing out on the opportunity to buy the dip. </p>
<p>The user argued that those holding the actual Bitcoin can take advantage of such situations while ETF investors are disadvantaged. Schiff concurred with the user&#8217;s perspective, emphasizing that owning Bitcoin directly provides better options than relying on a third party to store it and facing <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-boom-in-argentina-why-more-people-are-choosing-crypto-over-dollars/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">limited liquidity</a>.</p>

<p>Schiff&#8217;s preference for owning Bitcoin aligns with the principle of self-custody and control over one&#8217;s assets. By holding the actual cryptocurrency, investors can execute transactions at any time, regardless of market hours or the involvement of intermediaries.</p>
<img alt="Bitcoin ETF" class="size-large" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/wZoGihW1/" width="1815" />
<p>Currently, the price of BTC stands at $63,800, reflecting a 3% increase over the past 24 hours. The forthcoming price movements of the dominant cryptocurrency and its correlation with the ETF market, which has emerged as a significant factor impacting BTC&#8217;s price volatility, are eagerly anticipated. It remains to be seen how these factors will shape the future trajectory of the cryptocurrency market.</p>

<title>Greenpeace Claims To Expose The Bitcoin ‘Puppet Masters’</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/greenpeace-bitcoin-puppet-masters/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/greenpeace-bitcoin-puppet-masters/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是正面的。Greenpeace USA揭示了比特币挖矿行业与各种“气候否认者”之间密切联系的新丑闻，包括保守派智囊团、化石燃料游说者和气候变化怀疑论者之间的联系。然后，Bitcoin社区对此作出了强烈反应，挑战了报告的结论，并提出了更复杂的行业环境和可持续努力的对抗观点。最后，Bitcoin社区还通过o（Satoshi Action Fund）展示了对比特币倡导的效果和侵略性，突显了其在美国的积极作用。 <div>
<p>Greenpeace USA has unveiled a new shady <a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/reports/mining-for-power/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">report</a> alleging close ties between the Bitcoin mining industry and various “climate denialists.” Released on March 19, 2024, the report alleges deep-seated connections between the BTC mining industry and various entities traditionally viewed as opposing progressive climate change policies.</p>
<p>These include conservative think tanks, fossil fuel lobbyists, and climate change skeptics, casting a shadow on the Bitcoin community&#8217;s claims of moving towards sustainability.</p>
<p>Greenpeace&#8217;s investigation purports to reveal a web of relationships suggesting that, despite public claims of embracing renewable energy and reducing carbon footprints, the mining industry remains entangled with groups and individuals who have historically resisted efforts to combat climate change.</p>
<p>A particularly provocative claim is the purported alignment with networks funded by the conservative Koch brothers and the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), known for their anti-environmental stances and policies deemed anti-democratic.</p>
<p>The report goes further to accuse the Bitcoin mining sector of fostering a &#8220;revolving door&#8221; phenomenon with the government, especially figures from the former <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/trump-bitcoin-u-turn/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Trump administration</a>, implying an intricate dance of influence and policy manipulation that benefits the mining industry at the expense of environmental progress.</p>

<p>Erik Kojola, a senior researcher at Greenpeace USA, encapsulates the concern, asserting, &#8220;Our research uncovered deeper and more extensive connections between proponents of BTC mining and climate deniers than anticipated. The Bitcoin industry is akin to a house of cards that could topple at any time and people are working hard behind the scenes to ensure its longevity through greenwashing and deceit all at the expense of communities and the climate.”</p>
<p>Johanna Fornberg, Greenpeace USA Researcher added that the: “Bitcoin industry groups are caught up in a web that includes some of the most notorious climate denialists. [&#8230;] Revealing who has power and influence in this industry is essential for holding them accountable for unsubstantiated claims, climate impacts, and harm to local communities.”</p>
<p>Along with the report, Greenpeace USA created an interactive power map that shows the relationships between BTC industry groups, conservative and corporate interest groups, politicians, and other stakeholders highlighted in the report.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Community Reacts</h2>
<p>The release of Greenpeace&#8217;s Mining for Power report has sparked a robust response from the Bitcoin community, challenging the assertions made and offering a counter-perspective that paints a more complex picture of the industry&#8217;s environmental footprint and sustainability efforts.</p>
<p>Daniel Batten, a managing partner at CH4 Capital and an authoritative figure in the environmental analysis of BTC mining, leads the charge in disputing the report&#8217;s findings. Batten <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/greenpeace-bitcoin-lie-destroyed-brutal-post/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">criticizes Greenpeace</a> for relying on &#8220;a very old dataset,&#8221; which he argues no longer accurately represents the current state of BTC mining.</p>
<p>According to Batten, a significant portion of the Bitcoin network now relies on <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-mining-potential-top-science-journal/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">sustainable energy sources</a>, a claim backed by recent reports, including a Bloomberg Intelligence analysis from September 2023, which found that Bitcoin has achieved a 52.6% rate of sustainable energy use.</p>

<p>Batten robustly contests the claims about Bitcoin&#8217;s carbon footprint, water usage, and alleged strain on electrical grids, citing peer-reviewed research and expert analysis that contradicts Greenpeace&#8217;s conclusions. For instance, he references research indicating that mining contributes to grid stability, can lower electricity costs, and may accelerate the transition to renewable energy sources, thereby presenting a narrative of mining as potentially beneficial, rather than detrimental, to environmental sustainability efforts.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The only thing breaking is GreenpeaceUSA’s credibility. </p>
<p>One of the features of GreenpeaceUSA reports is that they are very easy to debunk. You rarely make it past the first paragraph without reading a large swathe of misinformation. This latest report is no exception. </p>
<p>1. “The… <a href="https://t.co/ekgUnpuriV" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://t.co/ekgUnpuriV</a></p>

<p></p>
<p>Echoing Batten&#8217;s sentiment, the Satoshi Action Fund (SAF), identified by Greenpeace as a prominent advocate for Bitcoin, has utilized the report&#8217;s publication as an opportunity to underscore its effectiveness and aggressiveness in promoting Bitcoin advocacy in the USA. Dennis Porter, the founder of SAF, stated via X, &#8220;HUGE NEWS: GreenPeace highlights Satoshi Act Fund as the most effective and aggressive Bitcoin advocacy group in the USA.&#8221;</p>

<p></p>
<p>Moreover, the Bitcoin community has been further bolstered by a community note from X , which flags Greenpeace&#8217;s article for containing outdated information and inaccuracies, especially regarding the energy sources for Bitcoin mining. It states, &#8220;The article contains many factual errors, like the flawed per transaction accounting of energy, and outdated and inaccurate information, such as the proportion of fossil fuels used as energy source. Nowadays the majority of the energy used by Bitcoin mining is renewable.”</p>
<p>At press time, BTC traded at $64,220.</p>

<title>FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried Buckles Ahead Of Sentencing, 50 Years Too Much?</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-50-years/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-50-years/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。<br />谈论前FTX首席执行官Sam Bankman-Fried即将在3月28日被判刑。他的律师最近表示，他不应该被判50年监禁。律师们表示，FTX客户并没有遭受损失，因为他们收到了破产加密交易所欠他们的钱。他们反驳了检察官的指控，称没有依据表明Bankman-Fried会再犯。他们担心他可能在监狱内丧命，并主张他应该被判5到6年监禁。检方声称他们希望公正对待被告，但律师们认为对Bankman-Fried这样的处罚过于严厉。 <div>
<p>Talks about <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-collapse-sam-bankman-fried-trial/">Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF)</a>, the former CEO of the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/major-reveals-from-the-ftx-bankruptcy-filing-whats-the-takeaway/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">defunct crypto exchange FTX</a>, have <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-prison-2/#:~:text=A%20recent%20court%20filing%20revealed,100%20years%20locked%20behind%20bars.">picked up steam</a> ahead of his sentencing on March 28. The primary discussion has been the number of years the defendant could get, with his lawyers recently arguing that the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftxs-sam-bankman-fried-should-receive-50-year-jail/">prosecution’s proposed sentence</a> of 50 years is unfair. </p>
<h2>Sam Bankman-Fried Getting 50 Years Is “Not Justice”</h2>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/66631291/413/united-states-v-bankman-fried/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">letter</a> addressed to Judge Lewis Kaplan, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-fraud/">Bankman-Fried’s lawyers</a> criticized the government’s memorandum, in which they proposed that SBF be sentenced to 40 to 50 years. They further mentioned that the prosecution is adopting a “medieval view of punishment to reach what amounts to a death-in-prison sentencing recommendation.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, his lawyers used the letter to rebut the prosecution’s arguments that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sam-bankman-fried-cites-autism-disorder/">Bankman-Fried</a> deserved 50 years in prison. Firstly, they stated that FTX customers didn’t suffer any loss since it had <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-repayment-plan-bitcoin-valued-at-16000/">already been decided</a> that they would receive the money the bankrupt crypto exchange owed them. </p>
<p>The lawyers argue that this wouldn’t have been possible if Sam Bankman-Fried had indeed stolen FTX’s assets, as the prosecution claimed. They also noted that the FTX founder had always acted in good faith, considering his efforts to ensure that FTX could process withdrawals before eventually <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/major-reveals-from-the-ftx-bankruptcy-filing-whats-the-takeaway/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">filing for bankruptcy</a>.</p>
<p>Bankman-Fried’s lawyers also countered the prosecution&#8217;s argument of Recidivism, claiming there was no basis for such belief. They added that offenders with no criminal history, like the defendant, are the least likely to re-offend. Moreover, offenders with a college education are less likely to recidivate. </p>
<p>In their <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-prison-2/#:~:text=A%20recent%20court%20filing%20revealed,100%20years%20locked%20behind%20bars.">sentencing submission</a>, the prosecution had likened Sam Bankman-Fried to other defendants like Bernie Madoff. However, his lawyers argued that this comparison was “way off base” since most cases they alluded to involved frauds that lasted up to a decade, unlike their <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/ftx/sam-bankman-fried-100m-political-favors/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">client’s fraudulent practice</a>, which didn’t last up to that. </p>
<h2>Bankman-Fried Could Die In Prison</h2>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-court/#:~:text=Sam%20Bankman%2DFried%20Chooses%20To%20Stick%20With%20New%20Lawyers&amp;text=Marc%20Mukasey%20and%20Torrey%20Young,team%20led%20by%20Mark%20Cohen.">Sam Bankman-Fried’s lawyers</a> raised the possibility of their client dying in prison due to his “<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sam-bankman-fried-cites-autism-disorder/">condition and vulnerabilities</a>.” Besides SBF’s condition, they mentioned that they are yet to identify a federal defendant convicted of a non-violent offense who served up to 40 to 50 years in prison and was eventually released. </p>

<p>They remarked this was perhaps due to inmates suffering a “two-year decline in life expectancy for each year of imprisonment.” Therefore, they believe this isn’t the way to go about SBF’s sentencing if the government wants to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-prison-2/#:~:text=A%20recent%20court%20filing%20revealed,100%20years%20locked%20behind%20bars.">achieve deterrence</a> and not completely ostracize the defendant. </p>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-defense/">The FTX founder’s lawyers</a> argue that “crushing Sam in this way is unnecessary,” especially considering that he has “lost everything and almost everyone.” Bankman-Fried’s lawyers had, in their sentencing submission, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-fraud/#:~:text=Bankman%2DFried&#039;s%20Lawyers%20Propose%20A,six%20and%20a%20half%20years).">proposed</a> that their client be sentenced to between five and six years. </p>
<p>They urged the government to consider this sentencing limit if they genuinely believed the defendant deserved to “return to liberty.”</p>

<title>Ethereum Foundation Receives Confidential Inquiry From Mysterious State Authority</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-foundation-receives-confidential-inquiry/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-foundation-receives-confidential-inquiry/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是负面的。以太坊基金会接受了未透露的“政府机构”的调查，已删除其拘留证据。说明可能面临的法律行动引起以太坊社区内的猜测和不确定性。据称，此调查可能与ETF拒绝有关。ETF的延迟和SEC与ETF发行人之间的缺乏沟通引发了进一步的推测。以太坊价格的弱点可能受到内部人员预期SEC的审查的影响。尽管存在不确定性，ETH已成功恢复，并在过去24小时中涨幅4%。 <div>
<p>The Ethereum Foundation (EF) has come under investigation by an undisclosed &#8220;state authority,&#8221;. As per a <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-foundation-website/commit/769b30603504b4b5e8f601f8014691a8d1821390" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">commit message</a> on GitHub, the EF received a &#8220;voluntary inquiry&#8221; from the authority, accompanied by a confidentiality requirement. </p>
<p>The details and scope of the investigation remain undisclosed, leading to speculation and uncertainty within the Ethereum community. However, this is the first time in the Ethereum Foundation&#8217;s history that it has faced such legal action. </p>
<h2>Ethereum Foundation Removes Warrant Canary</h2>
<p>In a significant development, the Ethereum Foundation has removed its Warrant Canary from its website, indicating that it has been subpoenaed by a government agency in the US, <a href="https://x.com/Husslin_/status/1770470520263209074?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">according </a>to former investment banker Husslin Narwal. </p>

<p>For further context, a warrant canary is a method used by organizations to communicate to the public that they have not received any secret subpoenas or government requests for user data or surveillance. It is a way for organizations to signal their compliance with legal requests without directly disclosing sensitive information. </p>
<img alt="Ethereum Foundation" class="size-large wp-image-288542" height="380" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GJH5eT5XYAAF4EB.jpeg?w=980&#038;resize=980%2C380" width="980" />
<p>Narwal further suggested that the inclusion of a confidentiality requirement suggests a gag order, restricting or prohibiting certain individuals or entities from speaking or disclosing certain information to the public or other parties, limiting the Foundation&#8217;s ability to disclose information about the investigation.</p>
<p>Moreover, Narwal highlighted several key points, including the foundation&#8217;s compliance with the authorities and willingness to provide private data. The delay in <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/fidelity-adjusts-ethereum-etf-application/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ethereum Exchange-Traded Funds</a> (ETFs) and the alleged lack of communication between the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and ETF issuers have led to speculation that the investigation may be linked to the ETF rejection. </p>
<h2>Speculation Mounts </h2>
<p>Narwal also mentioned the recent &#8220;weakness&#8221; in Ethereum&#8217;s price, possibly influenced by alleged insiders anticipating a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-watchdog-sues-sec-over-eth-gate/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">negative outcome</a> from the SEC. He suggested that the SEC may find evidence that casts doubt on Ethereum&#8217;s decentralization, such as a concentration of token ownership. </p>
<p>Additionally, Narwal mentioned previous <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-insider-china-eth-jeopardize-crypto/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">reports </a>suggesting significant Chinese ownership of ETH or the investigation related to fraud or tax matters. Narwal concluded his analysis by stating:</p>
<blockquote><p>Without any more info from the Foundation or any state authorities, traders will probably assume the worst and derisk </p></blockquote>

<p>Overall, the Ethereum Foundation&#8217;s investigation by an unnamed state authority has created uncertainty and speculation within the Ethereum community. The removal of the Warrant Canary and the confidentiality requirement have limited the foundation&#8217;s ability to provide details about the investigation. </p>
<p>As the situation unfolds, market participants eagerly await more information to gain clarity on the investigation&#8217;s scope and its potential <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-data-reveals-big-surge-edging-bitcoin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">impact </a>on the Ethereum ecosystem.</p>
<img alt="Ethereum Foundation " class="size-large" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/T9fNIHPx/" width="1815" />
<p>Despite the growing speculation surrounding the Ethereum Foundation, ETH has managed to recover the $3,289, coupled with a 4% gain in the last 24 hours. </p>

<title>Bitcoin Could See “More Pullback Than We Think,” Quant Explains Why</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-see-more-pullback-think-quant-explains-why/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-see-more-pullback-think-quant-explains-why/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。<br />一位量化分析师解释说，如果过去Open Interest的模式重复，比特币可能会出现持续的回撤。比特币的Open Interest最近显示出类似于2021年11月的轨迹。当Open Interest下降时，投资者可能会关闭头寸，导致价格波动。比特币的Open Interest最近出现下降趋势，与价格暴跌同时发生。最近的高峰类似于2021年11月的高点，当时比特币价格出现暴跌。未来市场发展和Open Interest轨迹是否与先前情况类似还有待观察。目前比特币价格回升至64000美元以上。 <div>
<p>A quant has explained that Bitcoin could end up seeing an extended drawdown if the past pattern in the Open Interest ends up repeating.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Open Interest Has Shown Similar Trajectory To November 2021 Recently</h2>
<p>In a CryptoQuant Quicktake <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/65fa88c3c7f2a01d8c7e3f9d-BTCs-open-interest-is-peaking-out-along-with-the-price-down" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, an analyst talked about the recent trend in the Bitcoin Open Interest. The &#8220;<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-open-interest-alarming-levels-brace-impact/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Open Interest</a>&#8221; is a metric that measures the total amount of BTC derivative contracts (in USD) that are currently open on all exchanges.</p>
<p>When the value of this indictor rises, it means that users are opening up more derivative positions right now. Generally, the total leverage present in the sector increases when the Open Interest rises, so the price may become more likely to show some volatility following this trend.</p>

<p>On the other hand, a decline in the metric suggests some of the investors are either closing up their positions of their own volition or getting forcibly liquidated by their platform.</p>
<p>Usually, sharp decreases in the indicator accompany violent price action, but once the drawdown has finished, the cryptocurrency may become calmer due to a clear out of leverage.</p>
<p>Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin Open Interest over the past few years:</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Open Interest" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="641" src="https://i0.wp.com/img.cryptoquant.com/3834/quicktake/6ipYv_eb09a51fd8d64743b953f641c51ac4fd753893e4119fa56adacf9159a941a22b.png?resize=1280%2C641&#038;ssl=1" width="1280" /></p>

<p>As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin Open Interest had shot up to some extremely high levels as the recent rally in the cryptocurrency&#8217;s price had occurred.</p>
<p>This trend wasn&#8217;t particularly surprising, as rallies tend to drive speculation. The scale, of the surge, though, was quite extraordinary when compared to past pattern.</p>
<p>&#8220;Open interest can be a powerful rally driver, but it can also be a clear indicator of overheating,&#8221; says the quant. &#8220;In that sense, open interest was a strong driver of BTC&#8217;s price in &#8217;23 and &#8217;24, which helped push the price to new all-time highs in &#8216;24.1Q.&#8221;</p>
<p>From the chart, it&#8217;s visible that the indicator has reversed its direction recently and has been falling down. This drawdown in the metric has come as the asset&#8217;s price has also crashed, causing a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/539-crypto-longs-flushed-bitcoin-plummets-63300/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">high amount of liquidations</a>.</p>
<p>As the analyst has highlighted in the chart, the recent highs in the Bitcoin Open Interest were similar to those observed during the November 2021 price all-time high.</p>
<p>Back then, once the Open Interest had started sliding off as the price had plunged, the asset entered into a state of freefall, which eventually led to the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/why-the-2022-crypto-bear-market-is-different/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">2022 bear market</a>.</p>

<p>&#8220;If the pattern of &#8216;21.4Q repeats, we could see more pullback than we think,&#8221; suggests the quant. It now remains to be seen how the market develops from here and if the trajectory of the Open Interest would go similarly to this previous instance or not.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>Bitcoin had slipped all the way to a low of $60,700 during the past day, but the coin has witnessed a rebound since then, as it&#8217;s now back above $64,000.</p>

<title>Plugging The Bitcoin Bleed: Grayscale CEO Confirms Fees Will Reduce As Outflows Cross $12 Billion</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bleed-grayscale-ceo/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。美国数字资产管理公司Grayscale近期出现了一系列资金流出情况。为了减轻这一问题，公司承诺将很快降低ETF费用。Grayscale首席执行官Michael Sonnenshein透露，该公司的比特币ETF（GBTC）费用将逐渐降低。然而，自美国证券交易委员会（SEC）批准后开始交易以来，Grayscale未能录得显著的净流入。公司决定降低费用，希望能够吸引更广泛的投资者，同时满足现有股东的需求。 <div>
<p>American digital asset management company, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-funds-lose-500m-as-grayscales-outflow-wanes/">Grayscale</a> has been experiencing a series of outflows in its <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/grayscale-bitcoin-etf-579-million/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Spot Bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF)</a> in recent times. As a result, the company has attempted to potentially curb the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/bitcoin/grayscale-bitcoin-etf-2-7-billion-exodus-jpmorgan/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">massive exodus</a>, promising to lower ETF fees soon.  </p>
<h2>Grayscale To Reduce Bitcoin ETF Fees</h2>
<p>In a recent interview, Grayscale’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Michael Sonnenshein, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2024/03/19/grayscale-ceo-says-gbtc-bitcoin-etf-fees-will-come-down-over-time.html" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">disclosed</a> to CNBC that the fees for the company’s Spot Bitcoin ETF (GBTC) will decrease over time. </p>

<p>Since the start of trading, after the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/breaking-news-ticker/breaking-sec-approves-all-11-spot-bitcoin-etfs-btc-price-holds-steady-at-46000/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">approved Spot Bitcoin ETFs</a>, Grayscale has failed to record a significant daily net inflow. However, the asset management firm has steadily <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/grayscale-bitcoin-etf-outflows-end-experts/">experienced outflows worth billions of dollars.</a> </p>
<p>“Of course, we anticipated having outflows. Investors have been wanting to either take gains on their portfolio, or arbitragers coming out of the fund, or people unwinding positions that were part of bankruptcies through forced liquidation,” Sonnenshein stated. </p>
<p>The company’s decision to lower fees marks a shift from its earlier position, where it justified charging investors a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etf-grayscale-spin-off-vaneck-slashes-fees/">higher-than-average fee compared to other Spot Bitcoin ETFs</a> in the market. Presently, Grayscale’s GBTC maintains the highest ETF fee by a wide margin, charging investors approximately 1.5% in fees. </p>
<p>Grayscale’s ETF fee stands in stark contrast to the fees maintained by other leading asset management companies, such as <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-slashes-bitcoin-etf-fees-to-competition/">BlackRock</a>, and Bitwise, which charge 0.25% and 0.21%, respectively. Impressively, these companies, particularly BlackRock, have been <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/spot-bitcoin-etf-hits-milestone-blackrock-influence-evident-in-1-billion-triumph/">seeing a considerable amount of inflows in its ETF</a>, making headlines as they experience a surge in investor demand.</p>
<p>Despite previously advocating the firm’s <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/grayscale-amendments-to-gbtc-trust-agreement/">exorbitant ETF fees</a>, Sonnenshein appears to have acknowledged market sentiment, announcing a reduction in its Spot Bitcoin ETF fees as the market continues to grow and mature. </p>
<h2>GBTC Witnesses Massive Outflows</h2>
<p>Grayscale’s sudden change of heart on retaining its lofty ETF fee may be attributed to the recent surge in outflows from its <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etfs-record-2-2-billion-inflow-in-past-week/">Spot Bitcoin ETF</a>. The asset management company has been witnessing a steady sell-off, totalling $12 billion in outflows since it began trading on January 11. </p>

<p>On Monday, March 18, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/record-breaking-gbtc-outflows-send-bitcoin-down-14-to-62000/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Grayscale recorded its largest outflow</a> in a single day. The asset management company <a href="https://x.com/cazenove_uk/status/1770051786184761509?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">witnessed</a> a staggering $642 million in withdrawals. </p>
<p>These massive outflows have been largely driven by the firm’s high fees, pushing investors and traders to gravitate towards companies offering <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-undercut-lower-spot-bitcoin-etf-fees/">Spot Bitcoin ETFs with less expensive fees. </a></p>
<p>With lower fees, Grayscale stands to attract a wider pool of investors, while also catering to the needs of its existing shareholders. The combination of the firm’s robust reputation, impressive track record and a reduced ETF fee holds the promise of mitigating current outflows and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/grayscale-urges-sec-options-trading-on-bitcoin-etfs/">potentially sparking renewed inflows. </a></p>

<title>Tornado Cash Founder Charged For Allegedly Aiding $1.2 Billion In Laundered Funds</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/tornado-cash-founder-charged-for-allegedly-aiding-1-2-billion-in-laundered-funds/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/tornado-cash-founder-charged-for-allegedly-aiding-1-2-billion-in-laundered-funds/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。在荷兰举行的审判将于3月26日开始，Tornado Cash背后的主要开发者Alexey Pertsev面临洗钱指控。指控称Pertsev在洗钱活动中有重复行为。辩护律师认为起诉书缺乏具体指控。起诉书指称Pertsev是"风暴现金"的共犯，帮助洗钱。审查发现36笔交易指向Tornado Cash，包括大量来自罗宁桥的以太币，与朝鲜网络组织拉萨勒斯有关。审判结果对加密货币社区具有重要意义，可能对开发人员产生冷冻效果。支持者包括Coinbase等表示软件开发不能等同于洗钱或犯罪。审判事件将深入探讨加密货币领域编码、洗钱和法律责任的复杂交集。 <div>
<p>In a trial set to commence on March 26 in the Dutch city of Hertogenbosch, Alexey Pertsev, the prominent developer behind Tornado Cash, finds himself at the center of a legal storm as he faces money laundering charges. The allegations, revealed in a three-page indictment obtained by DL News, accuse Pertsev of<a href="https://www.dlnews.com/articles/people-culture/alexey-pertsev-accused-of-laundering-1bn-at-tornado-cash/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> laundering over $1.2 billion in illicit funds.</a></p>

<p>According to Dutch prosecutors, Pertsev, who was arrested in August 2022, is accused of habitually engaging in money laundering activities.</p>
<p>However, his defense lawyer, Keith Cheng, maintains that the indictment lacks specificity regarding the exact acts Pertsev is alleged to have committed in relation to the criminal offense.</p>
<h2><strong>Tornado Cash Unveiled: Indictment Links Pertsev To Crypto Laundering</strong></h2>
<p>The indictment provides a glimpse into the state&#8217;s case, asserting that Pertsev was a co-perpetrator in laundering assets through <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/jy0916" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Tornado Cash</a>, a cryptocurrency mixer designed to obfuscate transaction trails.</p>
<p>Prosecutors have identified 36 transactions from decentralized protocols to Tornado Cash, including significant amounts of Ethereum (ETH) originating from platforms such as Ronin Bridge, which suffered a $625 million hack in 2022, linked to North Korean cyber group Lazarus.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/hoMe8Fwb/" width="1835" /></p>

<p>Decentralized protocols like Harmony and Nomad Bridge, both of which were associated with heists, are also mentioned in the indictment. US officials had previously sanctioned Tornado Cash, alleging its involvement in laundering millions of dollars from these incidents.</p>
<p>Following Pertsev&#8217;s arrest in the Netherlands, he was detained for nearly nine months and is presently subject to GPS monitoring with travel restrictions.</p>
<h2><strong>Stakes High: Pertsev Trial Could Set Precedent For Crypto Developers</strong></h2>
<p>The outcome of Pertsev&#8217;s trial holds significant implications for the cryptocurrency community. A guilty verdict could potentially create a chilling effect, resulting in developers and the open-source community fearing repercussions from US authorities for their involvement in projects that might later be deemed suspicious. Many within the crypto sphere view the case against Pertsev as an assault on coding itself.</p>
<p>Supporters ranging from major cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase to Ethereum developer Preston Van Loon and the Blockchain Association in Washington have rallied to Pertsev&#8217;s defense.</p>
<p>They argue that the act of software development should not be equated with participation in money laundering or similar crimes. This perspective aligns with the defense&#8217;s contention that the indictment lacks clarity on Pertsev&#8217;s specific actions.</p>

<p>Dutch prosecutors have hinted at a potential key element of their case, acknowledging the argument that software development cannot be inherently linked to criminal activities.</p>
<p>As the trial unfolds, it is likely that both the defense and prosecution will delve deeper into the complex intersection of coding, money laundering, and legal responsibility in the cryptocurrency landscape.</p>
<p>The trial of Alexey Pertsev is poised to be a pivotal event that could shape the future of cryptocurrency development and the regulatory landscape surrounding it.</p>

<title>Can Solana Exist Without Layer-2’s? Scalability Debate Ensues</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/can-solana-exist-without-layer-2s/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/can-solana-exist-without-layer-2s/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。Solana生态系统内的可扩展性辩论达到了白热化，主要围绕着Solana是否需要Layer-2（L2）解决方案展开。初始触发此辩论的是Solana项目DRiP的创始人Vibhu Norby提出的担忧，指出Solana面临的成本和技术挑战。开发人员对此有了反应，Solana基金会的BASED CHARKER强调了Firedancer项目的潜力，并认为Solana在未来2-3年内可能不需要L2解决方案。Solana Labs的联合创始人Anatoly Yakovenko从技术角度出发，认为硬件进步是解决可扩展性问题的关键。Norby还展望了Solana未来可能成为一个新互联网的愿景，预测将有数百万个应用程序建立在Solana上，创造一个比纳斯达克大100万倍的繁荣经济。 <div>
<p>The scalability debate within the Solana ecosystem has reached a fever pitch, fueled by pointed discussions on X (formerly Twitter) among leading figures in the blockchain space. At the heart of the debate is the question of whether Solana, a blockchain celebrated for its high throughput and low transaction costs, can maintain its performance and economic viability without resorting to Layer-2 (L2) solutions or <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/tezos-activates-mumbai-introduces-smart-rollups/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">rollups</a>.</p>
<h2>Does Solana Need L2?</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/vibhu/status/1770223481910874148" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">conversation</a> was kick-started by Vibhu Norby, the founder of the Solana-based project DRiP, who raised concerns over the escalating costs and technical challenges faced by applications operating on the SOL blockchain. Norby’s initial statement set the stage:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Controversial take that honestly really shouldn&#8217;t be. But want to put on the table a topic that has been happening in many private conversations. Solana is going to have and needs to have L2s and/or rollups.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>He detailed the substantial on-chain fees DRiP encountered, amounting to &#8220;$10,000 in on-chain fees last week,&#8221; underscoring the misalignment of incentives as app success paradoxically increases infrastructure costs. He remarked, &#8220;The very apps that bring traffic and customers to the chain are rewarded with increased infra cost when the token appreciates in value,&#8221; suggesting a misalignment between the ecosystem&#8217;s growth and its economic incentives.</p>

<p>This, according to Norby, necessitates a discussion on the scalability and economic model, suggesting that &#8220;I think many app builders will be happy to make calculated decentralization tradeoffs to have favorable economics and TPS.&#8221;</p>
<p>The response from the developer community was swift. BASED CHARKER, Global Developer Growth at the Solana Foundation, countered Norby&#8217;s perspective by highlighting the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/jump-crypto-solana-validator-client-software/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">potential of Firedancer</a>, a project aimed at significantly enhancing scalability.</p>
<p>Charker stated, &#8220;If Firedancer achieves what it set out to do and current issues are resolved (they will be) you’re not going to need a L2 in the next 2-3 years.&#8221; He acknowledged the frustrations of developers like Norby but remained optimistic about <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/why-solana-visa-reveals-reasons-for-partnership/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Solana&#8217;s roadmap</a> and its capacity to scale effectively without Layer-2 solutions.</p>

<p>Anatoly Yakovenko, the co-founder of Solana Labs, chimed in with a technical standpoint focusing on the hardware aspect: &#8220;Hardware won’t get conservative, though. Solana code base will get conservative when the only thing that validators need to do is add more cores.&#8221; This perspective suggests an enduring solution to scalability lies in leveraging hardware advancements, reinforcing the belief in the foundational technology to meet future demands.</p>
<p>The discourse also touched on the nature of blockchain evolution and market forces. Jordan Prince, co-founder of Solana-based B+J Studios, posited a market-driven outcome: &#8220;The free market always wins one way or the other! Either the base layer becomes fast enough and cheap enough quickly enough to avoid some tacked on L2, or it doesn’t and someone builds one first to solve the problem.&#8221;</p>
Vision For A Scalable Future
<p>Beyond identifying challenges, Norby also articulated a forward-looking vision for Solana, envisioning it as the foundation for a new internet. &#8220;I think I am way more bullish on Solana than anyone in the world. I foresee millions of apps built on this new internet called Solana. I think we are going to recreate all of our core internet apps including social, email, commerce, financial, etc.,&#8221; he stated.</p>
<p>This ambitious vision underscores Norby&#8217;s belief in Solana&#8217;s potential to host a vast and vibrant digital economy, far surpassing current applications and possibly challenging traditional internet infrastructure. However, he acknowledges the future need for &#8220;a plethora of scaling solutions, call them L2s or something else entirely,&#8221; in order to create &#8220;a thriving economy 1 million times bigger than the NASDAQ.”</p>

<title>Peter Schiff Questions True Agenda Behind MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin Acquisition</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/peter-schiff-questions-microstrategys-bitcoin-buys/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。Peter Schiff披露了MicroStrategy公司购买比特币的真实意图，指出Michael Saylor可能在利用比特币价格操纵来卖掉自己的MSTR股份。Schiff批评通过ETF持有比特币存在的问题，认为拥有自己的数字货币比通过第三方提供的ETF更好。 MicroStrategy公司最近购买了大量比特币，已经损失了超过1.15亿美元，导致公司股票下跌超过16%。<br /> <div>
<p>Michael Saylor&#8217;s MicroStrategy is currently in the limelight, as Gold advocate and Bitcoin critic <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-hater-peter-schiff-scoffs-at-rally/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Peter Schiff</a> spells out the real intentions behind the tech company&#8217;s large BTC accumulation over time.</p>
<h2>Peter Schiff Unveils Michael Saylor&#8217;s Intentions In Bitcoin Buys</h2>
<p>Peter Schiff <a href="https://x.com/PeterSchiff/status/1770099578664030297?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">disclosed</a> the information about the Tysons-based tech firm on the social media platform X on Tuesday, causing quite a stir within the crypto community. Firstly, Schiff highlighted that the firm is currently &#8220;suffering a loss of over $115 million on the Bitcoin it recently purchased using borrowed funds.&#8221;</p>

<p>As a result, Schiff is curious why Michael Saylor continues to take out loans from its MSTR shares to purchase BTC, following a significant increase in the coin&#8217;s price.</p>
<p>According to the Gold advocate, it appears Michael Saylor carried out these moves with the main aim of &#8220;manipulating the price of Bitcoin to move up&#8221; while &#8220;selling off his own MSTR shares.&#8221;</p>
<p>The post read:</p>
<blockquote><p>MSTR is already down over $115 million on the BTC it just bought with borrowed money. I wonder why Michael Saylor always borrows money to buy Bitcoin after a big move-up. It looks like his true intention is to manipulate the Bitcoin price higher as he dumps his own MSTR shares.</p></blockquote>
<p>Schiff also <a href="https://x.com/PeterSchiff/status/1770091004483297486?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">mentioned</a> in another X post that MicroStrategy shares are &#8220;down by over 16%,&#8221; which might be due to the company selling the stocks to acquire more BTC. &#8220;Bitcoin Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) they have boosted are down by 6% and MSTR has fallen by 16%,&#8221; Schiff stated. </p>
<p>He further claimed that even after more than 3 hours of market coverage, &#8220;not once did CBNC talk about BTC nor the company&#8217;s favorite stock MSTR.&#8221; In addition, he stated that &#8220;CBNC is not telling its audience anything, while Bitcoin whales discreetly liquidate their stockpiles.&#8221;</p>
<p>Schiff&#8217;s revelation came in light of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/microstrategy-bitcoin-bet-btc/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">MicroStrategy</a>&#8216;s latest Bitcoin acquisition, purchasing around 9245 BTC valued at $623 million, in one week. MicroStrategy completed another convertible note offering to expand its BTC holdings, and presently, the company boasts 1% of the crypto asset&#8217;s overall supply.</p>
<p>When it comes to Bitcoin, Microstrategy has become one of the largest entities devoted to holding the digital asset. So far, the company has acquired about 190,000 BTC worth approximately $9.9 billion and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/michael-saylor-to-buy-bitcoin-forever-details/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">does not have any plans to sell the asset.</a></p>
<h2>Problem With Owning BTC Through ETFs</h2>
<p>Schiff continues to criticize the largest cryptocurrency asset, <a href="https://x.com/PeterSchiff/status/1770227134985895971?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">expressing</a> concerns regarding owning BTC through exchange-traded products. According to Schiff, &#8220;owning the coin&#8221; through an <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-markets-swell-in-2024-spotlight-bitcoin-etfs/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">ETF</a> has several setbacks, one of which is its &#8220;limited liquidity to US market hours.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is because if the market crashes during the night, investors will be &#8220;unable to sell&#8221; until the US market opens for business again the following morning, which can be extremely annoying to watch helplessly while being &#8220;unable to get out.&#8221; Thus, he believes that having your own <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-price-surges-to-new-all-time-high-is-100000-in-sight/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">BTC</a> is a far &#8220;better choice&#8221; than paying a third party to store it with limited liquidity.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Slide Decoded: Top Trader Provides Expert Analysis</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-slide-top-trader-provides-expert-analysis/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-slide-top-trader-provides-expert-analysis/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。比特币价格下跌，专家指出市场行为是主要原因。涌入高波动性的模因币导致价格下降。此外，多种因素如市场不确定性、大规模比特币ETF流出等也在拉低比特币价格。投资者转向模因币，可能影响比特币的稳定性，而技术分析显示比特币价格缺乏近期上涨信心。投资者需谨慎，注意投资风险和其对整个加密货币市场的影响。 <div>
<p>There has been a decline in Bitcoin that few predicted. An expert trader at Binance clarifies this tendency, arguing that it has to do with how the market behaves.</p>
<p>As the price of bitcoin rises, a lot of traders start to shift from their typical buying and selling locations. Rather, they use borrowed funds to gamble on highly volatile meme currencies in an attempt to chase after popular coins, which can fluctuate on a daily basis.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">When prices go up and on-chain/perps start moving people don&#8217;t need slots any more, they can just long the memecoin du jour on leverage.</p>
<p>— Tree (@Tree_of_Alpha) <a href="https://twitter.com/Tree_of_Alpha/status/1769866756548383136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">March 18, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<h2><strong>What Are The Factors Pulling Bitcoin Price Down?</strong></h2>
<p>Bitcoin is down today due to several factors impacting the cryptocurrency market. The price of the top crypto dropped 7% to as low as $62,400 on March 19, with a broader market correction reinforcing BTC’s resistance at the $68,000 level.</p>
<p>This decline was triggered by Bitcoin falling below $63,000, leading to a marketwide sell-off that saw the global crypto market capitalization drop 8% over the past 24 hours to rest at $2.4 trillion.</p>
<p>Additionally, more than $640 million worth of BTC flowed out of Grayscale’s spot Bitcoin ETF GBTC on March 18, contributing to a net outflow from spot BTC ETFs to $154 million.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/MKTFZ829/" width="2475" /></p>

<p>The market uncertainty, cooling of the recent bull run, and large-scale Bitcoin ETFs have also played a role in the decline. Long liquidations in the crypto futures market and a different market cycle have further driven the crypto market lower, with over $149 million in long positions being liquidated across the crypto market in the past 24 hours</p>
<h2><strong>Rush To Memecoins Threatens BTC Stability, Analysts Caution</strong></h2>
<p>Meanwhile, investors seeking quicker profits are rushing into volatile meme coins, potentially hindering the growth of established cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, according to industry analysts.</p>
<p>The surge in meme coin buying coincides with rising prices for major cryptos like Bitcoin. However, this excitement for potentially explosive returns in meme coins may be causing neglect for the core market.</p>
<p>Analysts warn that the use of leverage, where investors borrow money to magnify their buying power, is prevalent in meme coin purchases. While this can amplify gains, it also significantly increases the risk of substantial losses.</p>

<p>This shift in investor focus away from Bitcoin could lead to a decrease in its buying pressure, causing its price to stagnate or even drop.</p>
<p>Technical analysis of Bitcoin&#8217;s price chart indicates a current lack of confidence in a near-term upswing. Key support levels around $56,260 and $51,802 could prevent a steeper price fall.</p>
<p>If Bitcoin can overcome resistance around $64,000, it might signal a return to its recent highs. Otherwise, the price could see a sustained drop or extended period of stagnation.</p>
<p>While meme coins offer the allure of high returns, investors should be aware of the associated risks and the potential impact of their choices on the broader cryptocurrency market.</p>

The parties express their intent, stating, &#8220;The proposal will ensure prompt, public access to the Parties’ briefs (as to which any proposed redactions are anticipated to be minimal), which is consistent with the &#8216;strong presumption&#8217; of public access.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Ripple Vs. SEC: The Detailed Remedies Timeline</h2>
<p><strong>March 22, 2024:</strong> The SEC is scheduled to file its opening <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-lawsuit-sec-remedies-briefing-deadlines/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">remedies-related brief</a> along with supporting declarations and exhibits, all under seal. This initial step allows the parties to review the documents and identify any sensitive information that might necessitate redaction before public release.</p>
<p><strong>March 25, 2024:</strong> Ripple and the SEC are set to meet and confer to discuss and agree upon the redactions to be applied to the SEC’s opening brief and its supporting materials. This collaborative approach is aimed at identifying and minimizing the extent of redactions, thereby maximizing the information available to the public.</p>
<p><strong>March 26, 2024:</strong> Following the meet and confer, the SEC will file a public, redacted version of its opening brief. This version will include only those redactions that were agreed upon by both parties (and third parties, if applicable) during the meeting. Furthermore, any supporting exhibits not classified as Confidential or Highly Confidential under the Protective Order will be filed on the public docket, enhancing the transparency of the proceedings.</p>

<p><strong>April 22, 2024:</strong> Ripple is expected to file its opposition brief and supporting documents. If these materials do not contain any information designated as Confidential or Highly Confidential by the SEC, they will be filed publicly but redacted. This ensures that confidential information remains protected while allowing public access to the case&#8217;s developments.</p>
<p><strong>April 23, 2024:</strong> Should Ripple’s materials include confidential information, a meeting is scheduled for this date to discuss redactions specific to Ripple&#8217;s opposition brief and its supporting documents.</p>
<p><strong>April 24, 2024:</strong> Ripple will file a public, redacted version of its opposition brief based on the previous day’s discussions, adhering to the agreed-upon redactions to protect sensitive information while maintaining the commitment to transparency.</p>
<p><strong>May 6, 2024:</strong> The SEC will submit its reply brief under seal, initiating the final phase of the sealing and redaction process.</p>
<p><strong>May 7, 2024:</strong> A meeting will occur to discuss and determine necessary redactions to the SEC’s reply brief and any accompanying exhibits, ensuring that any sensitive information is appropriately protected.</p>

<p><strong>May 8, 2024:</strong> The SEC is to file a public, redacted version of its reply brief along with any supporting exhibits not classified as Confidential or Highly Confidential. This step marks the culmination of the scheduled submissions and emphasizes the ongoing effort to balance confidentiality with the public&#8217;s right to access.</p>
<p><strong>May 13, 2024:</strong> Both parties, along with any third parties, will file omnibus letter-motions to seal materials related to the remedies-related briefing. This includes the briefs, declarations, and supporting exhibits, alongside proposed redactions to such materials, indicating a comprehensive approach to handling sensitive information within the case.</p>
<p><strong>May 20, 2024:</strong> The parties and any third parties involved are scheduled to file letter-briefs in opposition to the omnibus letter-motions to seal, facilitating a discourse on the necessity and extent of sealing certain documents and information.</p>
Insights Will Remain Concealed From The XRP Community
<p>This meticulously structured timeline officially demonstrates the parties&#8217; commitment to transparency, ensuring that the public remains informed of the case&#8217;s progress while safeguarding sensitive information. However, Bill Morgan, closely monitoring the case from the XRP community&#8217;s perspective, has a different <a href="https://twitter.com/Belisarius2020/status/1770215613417550085" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">opinion</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>For all those that thought the SEC succeeding earlier this year in its motion ordering disclosure of Ripple post-complaint contracts with institutions meant disclosure to the world it didn’t. It meant disclosure to the SEC subject to a protective order, and there is likely a lot of commercially sensitive material Ripple will seek to have redacted and sealed in the SEC brief and reply brief.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>At press time, XRP traded at $0.58657.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Boom In Argentina: Why More People Are Choosing Crypto Over Dollars</title>

<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-boom-in-argentina-why-more-people-are-choosing-crypto-over-dollars/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章介绍了阿根廷人在当前经济不稳定的情况下如何转向比特币来保值和获取增长。随着比特币价值上涨，人们逐渐放弃将比索兑换成美元的传统方式，转而寻求比特币的升值潜力和投资多样化。稳定币的使用减少，因为人们更看重比特币的增长潜力。然而，比特币市场存在安全风险和监管不确定性，阿根廷当局需要制定平衡的政策来促进创新并保护投资者。 <div>
<p>Argentina, a nation no stranger to economic turmoil, is witnessing a fascinating shift in how its citizens are safeguarding their wealth. With inflation persistently gnawing at the value of the peso, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-19/bitcoin-gains-dim-argentines-dollar-refuge-with-276-inflation" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Argentines are increasingly turning to Bitcoin</a> as a shield against the eroding purchasing power of their currency. This trend marks a potential turning point, potentially shaking the long-held tradition of exchanging pesos for US dollars as a hedge against inflation.</p>

<h2><strong>Fueling The Bitcoin Boom: Milei&#8217;s Policies And Disillusionment With The Dollar</strong></h2>
<p>The recent<a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/argentina-bitcoin-inflation-rally-dollar-greenback-dollarization-inflation-milei-peso-2024-3" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> surge in Bitcoin adoption in Argentina</a> coincides with the economic policies implemented by <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-enthusiast-javier-milei-secures-win/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">President Javier Milei.</a> His administration&#8217;s focus on controlling the money supply, aimed at stabilizing the economy, has seen a relative strengthening of the peso. While this is a positive development, it has also prompted Argentines to explore alternative options for<a href="https://www.livemint.com/economy/argentina-economy-crisis-uday-kotak-takes-aim-at-bad-macro-says-bitcoin-might-be-better-than-peso-during-inflation-11710904715869.html" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> inflation</a> protection.</p>
<p>The traditional method of converting pesos to dollars has lost some of its luster. The parallel exchange rate, where Argentines exchange pesos for dollars outside official channels, has strengthened by 10% against the US dollar in recent months. This, coupled with a stagnant or even declining dollar value globally, has made the greenback a less enticing option.</p>
<h2><strong>Bitcoin&#8217;s Allure: Appreciation Potential And Diversification</strong></h2>
<p>Bitcoin, on the other hand, has presented itself as a potentially more attractive proposition. During the same period when the peso saw a relative rise and the dollar stagnated, Bitcoin&#8217;s value skyrocketed by nearly 60%.</p>
<p>This significant appreciation potential is a major draw for Argentines looking to not just preserve the value of their savings, but also potentially see growth. Additionally, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/argentina-ngo-to-teach-high-schoolers-crypto/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin offers a valuable diversification</a> opportunity, allowing Argentines to move away from a reliance on solely fiat currencies, both domestic and foreign.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/TlzQFdd8/" width="2475" /></p>

<strong>Shifting Preferences: Stablecoins Take A Backseat</strong>
<p>An interesting wrinkle in this story is the observed decline in the use of stablecoins alongside the rise of Bitcoin. Stablecoins, crypto assets pegged to established currencies like the US dollar, are often favored for their price stability.</p>
<p>However, in Argentina&#8217;s current economic climate, where the focus seems to be on potential growth rather than pure value preservation, users are gravitating towards Bitcoin&#8217;s potential for appreciation. This highlights the evolving investment strategies Argentines are adopting in response to their unique economic situation.</p>

<strong>Challenges And Considerations: Security Concerns And Regulatory Uncertainty</strong>
<p>The surge in Bitcoin adoption in Argentina, while exciting, is not without its challenges. As with any new and emerging investment option, the risk of scams and fraudulent activity increases alongside popularity.</p>
<p>Bitcoin Argentina, a prominent cryptocurrency advocacy group, has reported a fivefold increase in scams in just February. This underscores the importance of investor education and the need for robust security measures to protect individuals venturing into the cryptocurrency space.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the regulatory landscape surrounding cryptocurrencies in Argentina remains somewhat uncertain. While the government hasn&#8217;t explicitly banned them, a lack of clear regulations could create challenges for both investors and businesses.</p>
<p>As the market evolves, it&#8217;s crucial for Argentinian authorities to develop a balanced approach that fosters innovation while ensuring consumer protection and financial stability.</p>

<title>Bitcoin ETF Fee War: Grayscale CEO Says GBTC Fees Will Drop Over Time</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etf-fee-war-grayscale-ceo-says-gbtc-fees-will-drop-over-time/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />巨头们为吸引客户，降低比特币ETF费用展开竞争。Grayscale CEO表示，尽管不参与当前费用战，GBTC将来会降低费用。尽管GBTC出现了120亿美元的资金流出，但CEO对其未来发展前景持乐观态度。他认为，市场仍有待探索，许多潜在投资者尚未接触到这些投资产品。 <div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The massive interest in Bitcoin ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) has created a war between issuers to attract clients to their products. The financial giants have taken different approaches to captivate the public, and lowering the fees has been a crucial component of these strategies.</p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Grayscale Unfazed By Bitcoin ETF Fee War</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">In an <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/19/grayscale-ceo-says-gbtc-bitcoin-etf-fees-will-come-down-over-time.html?taid=65f967ca25aac600014c8104" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">interview</a> with CNBC, Michael Sonnenshein talked about the Bitcoin ETF fee war and the future of Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) as the ETF market continues to expand.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">During the approval and subsequent launch process of the spot Bitcoin ETFs, most issuers tried to captivate the public’s interest with very low management fees. The battle continued as issuers extensively promoted their ETFs on different platforms to attract retail investors.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The asset managers have used Google ad campaigns, mainstream media advertisements, and a strong social media presence to compete against each other.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Grayscale CEO says fees on its bitcoin ETF will drop over time after outflows hit $12 billion <a href="https://t.co/lQnoMlC9YQ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://t.co/lQnoMlC9YQ</a></p>
<p>&mdash; CNBC (@CNBC) <a href="https://twitter.com/CNBC/status/1770033514810954013?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">March 19, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">However, the fee war remains the main incentive to attract new clients. The battle heated up after asset manager VanEck announced its fee waiver. The zero-fee approach until March 2025 is the firm’s latest strategy after falling behind its competitors.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The GBTC 1.5% management fee, defended by the CEO before, remains the highest among the competition. Nonetheless, in the CNBC interview, Sonnenshein announced that GBTC will reduce its fees in the future:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I’ll happily confirm that, over time, as this market matures, the fees on GBTC will come down.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The CEO further explained that during the early stages of a product’s lifecycle, the maintenance fees tend to be higher, but “as those markets mature, and as those funds grow, those fees tend to come down, and we expect the same to be true of GBTC.”</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Despite not participating in the current fee war, Grayscale recently <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etf-grayscale-spin-off-vaneck-slashes-fees/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">filed</a> for a new investment product called “Grayscale Bitcoin Mini Trust.” This product would transfer some of the fund’s BTC to the Mini Trust.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Presumably, it would cost much less than GBTC while operating independently. Sonnenshein told CNBC that “all of these new issuers came into the market to compete with us” while simultaneously competing with each other.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">GBTC’s Game Just Begun Despite $12 Billion In Outflows</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Grayscale’s <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/breaking-grayscale-scores-victory-against-us-sec-spot-bitcoin-etf-imminent/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">win against</a> the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) paved the way for the spot Bitcoin ETF approval in the US. However, despite managing the $26 billion GBTC, the digital asset manager has seen over $12 billion in capital outflows since the trust converted into an ETF in mid-January.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Net outflow of $154m on 18 March for the Bitcoin ETFs, driven by record $643m GBTC outflow <a href="https://t.co/ozlr7Ql9jH" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://t.co/ozlr7Ql9jH</a> <a href="https://t.co/r1Riwxjspo" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/r1Riwxjspo</a></p>
<p>&mdash; Farside Investors (@FarsideUK) <a href="https://twitter.com/FarsideUK/status/1769934849630994780?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">March 19, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Sonnenshein said during the interview that the firm anticipated having outflows. Although its high fees account for a considerable percentage of the liquidations, the CEO listed some of the reasons he considers would explain the massive numbers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Investors have been wanting to either take gains on their portfolio, or arbitragers coming out of the fund, or people unwinding positions that were part of bankruptcies through forced liquidation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The massive <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/grayscale-bitcoin-etf-outflows-end-experts/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">liquidations</a> didn’t come as a surprise. Nonetheless, the CEO believes that substantial outflows have sustained GBTC’s performance, as he believes the game is just beginning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">We’re kind of at the end of that first inning now, where the pent-up demand for buying has hopefully been satisfied, the pent up demand for selling has also hopefully been satisfied.</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Optimistic about the future of GBTC, the CEO believes that they are moving towards “that second and third inning” and that there’s still a lot of market to explore as many possible investors are yet to access these investment products.</p>

<title>Coinbase Gains Strong Support From Paradigm And Industry Leaders In SEC Battle</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/paradigm-industry-titans-rallying-behind-coinbase/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/paradigm-industry-titans-rallying-behind-coinbase/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章介绍了加密货币行业敦促美国证券交易委员会（SEC）为加密货币市场建立明确的规则和监管政策。主要参与者包括 Paradigm、加密技术创新委员会和美国商会，他们支持Coinbase向SEC提出明确指导加密货币行业的上诉。文章指出，加密货币行业挑战SEC的监管方法，认为SEC的现行规定不适用于加密货币的特性，缺乏关于加密货币的明确规范导致行业发展受阻。 Coinbase请求SEC制定明确的指导方针，并呼吁建立稳定的监管框架以平衡监管和创新。最终，加密货币行业要求SEC为加密货币行业制定规则以促进行业的发展。 <div>
<p>The cryptocurrency industry is pushing the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to establish clear rules and regulations for the crypto market. </p>
<p>Major players, including Paradigm, the Crypto Council for Innovation, and the US Chamber of Commerce, have argued with the district court to support Coinbase&#8217;s appeal to the SEC to provide specific guidelines for the crypto industry. </p>
<h2>Crypto Industry Challenges SEC&#8217;s Regulatory Approach</h2>
<p>In a <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca3.121484/gov.uscourts.ca3.121484.20.0.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">court filing</a> submitted on Monday, Paradigm expressed interest in the case, highlighting the SEC&#8217;s continued refusal to issue final rules and guidance regarding cryptocurrencies, tokens, and related trading platforms. </p>
<p>Paradigms&#8217; legal team explained that despite bringing <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/fidelity-adjusts-ethereum-etf-application/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">enforcement actions</a> in the crypto space, the SEC has not adequately explained the legal basis for its authority, creating uncertainty for entrepreneurs and hindering the availability of judicial review. </p>
<p>The Crypto Council for Innovation and other industry stakeholders argue that the SEC&#8217;s current approach contributes to the ambiguity surrounding cryptocurrencies and hinders the industry&#8217;s progress. In addition, the Crypto Council asserts that the SEC&#8217;s current <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/velars-dharma-amm-lays-the-groundwork-for-a-new-defi-ecosystem-built-on-bitcoin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">regulatory framework</a>, designed for traditional securities, does not address the unique characteristics of crypto assets. </p>

<p>Unlike securities, crypto-assets do not rely on a centralized issuer and operate within decentralized networks and communities. As a result, the SEC&#8217;s focus on requiring disclosures from centralized issuers does not provide digital asset holders with the material information they need. </p>
<p>The filing reads that the current framework also imposes unnecessary intermediaries that hinder the disintermediated nature of crypto trading platforms. </p>
<p>Paradigm also points out that several crypto projects have attempted to comply with SEC registration requirements but have faced <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-price-down-today/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">significant challenges</a>. The SEC initially recommended using Form 10 for registration but later abandoned this approach, leading to the failure or stagnation of projects that followed it. </p>
<p>Other projects explored using the &#8220;Reg A&#8221; registration exemption, but according to the Crypto Council, this also proved “unworkable” when applied to crypto assets. Furthermore, the firm claims the existing regulatory framework, designed for traditional securities, does not address the unique characteristics and requirements of the crypto industry.</p>
<h2>Coinbase Urges SEC For Clear Guidelines</h2>
<p>Coinbase petitioned the SEC to create clear guidelines regarding when crypto assets should be classified as securities. Coinbase argued that the industry, valued at over $2 trillion, needs regulatory oversight and that companies are eager to comply with a well-defined framework. </p>
<p>The court filing further states that<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-brazilian-real-stablecoin-xrp-ledger/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> regulatory compliance</a> requires predictability, and Coinbase&#8217;s petition seeks to establish a stable balance between regulation and innovation. </p>
<p>Paradigm concluded its arguments by stating that the SEC&#8217;s current approach of regulation-by-enforcement, where attempts at compliance are met with punishment, does not provide the stability necessary for the industry to thrive. The filing concludes by asserting:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Court should vacate the agency’s denial of Coinbase’s rulemaking petition and remand with instructions for the SEC to engage in rulemaking.</p></blockquote>

<p>Ultimately, the crypto industry, represented by Paradigm, the Crypto Council for Innovation, and other stakeholders, is calling on the SEC to initiate <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/debt-box-judge-penalizes-sec-for-abuse-of-power/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">rulemaking </a>for the crypto sector. </p>
<p>The demand for clear guidelines stems from the SEC&#8217;s persistent refusal to provide comprehensive rules and guidance, hindering the growth and development of the industry. </p>
<img alt="Coinbase" class="size-large" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/pVFMDN3h/" width="1815" />
<p>Coinbase’s stock, traded under the COIN ticker, is currently valued at $228, reflecting a decline of more than 4% in the last 24 hours. This decline closely mirrors the price movement of Bitcoin (BTC), which has experienced a 5% drop, bringing its price to $64,200 at the time of writing.</p>

<title>$533 Million Crypto Longs Flushed As Bitcoin Plummets To $62,600</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/539-crypto-longs-flushed-bitcoin-plummets-63300/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/539-crypto-longs-flushed-bitcoin-plummets-63300/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。文章显示，比特币价格下跌至63,000美元以下，导致约5.33亿美元的加密货币多头合约被清算。随着比特币继续下跌，在过去24小时内其价格下跌了7%。加密衍生品市场在过去一天中经历了巨额清算，近6.57亿美元的合约被清算，80%涉及看涨市场。比特币和以太坊的清算额最高，分别为1.91亿美元和1.34亿美元。比特币持仓量仍处于相对极端的水平。 <div>
<p>Data shows that around $533 million in crypto long contracts have been flushed down as Bitcoin crashed below the $63,000 level.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Has Continued Its Recent Downtrend During The Past Day</h2>
<p>Since setting a new all-time high (ATH) above the $73,800 mark, Bitcoin&#8217;s fates have changed as the digital asset has switched to experiencing bearish momentum instead.</p>

<p>The coin has extended this latest drawdown in the last 24 hours, dropping its price by more than 7%. The chart below shows the cryptocurrency&#8217;s recent performance.</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Price Chart" class="alignnone size-medium" height="854" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/xZckr1PX/" width="1534" /></p>

<p>As the graph shows, Bitcoin has plunged to the $62,600 level for the first time in a few weeks. This means that BTC has declined by over 15% since the ATH.</p>
<p>While BTC&#8217;s performance in the past day has been bad, the rest of the sector has performed even worse on average, with some coins even dipping into double-digit losses.</p>
<p>Because of all this volatility, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-spot-derivatives-flow-spikes-bullish-price/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">derivative side of the market</a> has seen a shakeup as liquidations have piled up on the various exchanges.</p>
<h2>Crypto Derivative Market Has Seen Huge Liquidations In The Past Day</h2>
<p>A contract is said to be &#8220;<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-futures-liquidations-150m-bitcoin-plummets/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">liquidated</a>&#8221; when it amasses losses of a specific degree, leading to the platform with which it&#8217;s open stepping in and forcibly closing it off.</p>
<p>According to data from <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">CoinGlass</a>, many such liquidations have occurred in the cryptocurrency sector during the last 24 hours. The table below breaks down this market flush.</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin &amp; Crypto Liquidations" class="aligncenter wp-image-288261 size-full" height="302" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/table_0ac60b.png?resize=558%2C302" width="558" /></p>

<p>It would appear that almost $657 million in cryptocurrency derivative contracts have been liquidated in the past day. Given that the price action in the market today has been heavily towards the downside, it&#8217;s not surprising that the vast majority of this flush involved long contracts.</p>
<p>More specifically, the long side of the market has suffered $533 million in liquidations, while the short side has been dealt a $123 million blow. More than 80% of the liquidations have involved those betting on a bullish outcome for the asset.</p>
<p>In terms of the individual symbols, Bitcoin and Ethereum have again been at the top of the charts, with $191 million and $134 million in liquidations, respectively.</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin &amp; Other Cryptos" class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-288262 aligncenter" height="294" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/data_7738b9.png?w=640&#038;resize=640%2C294" width="640" /></p>

<p>Out of the altcoins, Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE) have stood out with their $39 million and $14 million liquidations, respectively. Their large flushes may be partially due to their sharper drops than the other alts.</p>

<p>The chart below shows that despite the high liquidations, the Bitcoin Open Interest is still at relatively extreme levels.</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Open Interest" class="alignnone wp-image-288263 size-large aligncenter" height="275" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/chart_f0c95a.png?resize=980%2C275" width="980" /></p>

<p>The &#8220;<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-open-interest-alarming-levels-brace-impact/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Open Interest</a>&#8221; measures the total number of BTC-related contracts on the derivative market. Generally, the coin is more likely to show volatility when this metric is high, so sharp price action may continue until the indicator cools off more.</p>

<p>Popular doggy-themed cryptocurrency, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-price-soars-10-in-reaction-to-explosive-2367-shib-burn-surge/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Shiba Inu, </a>has surpassed previous record highs, experiencing a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-most-popular-crypto/">meteoric surge in popularity</a> and emerging as one of the most searched cryptocurrencies on Google.   </p>
<h2>Shiba Inu Google Searches Skyrocket</h2>
<p>Google Trends, an advanced tool developed by Google for analyzing the popularity of top search queries, has recently <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;q=shiba%20inu&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">unveiled</a> a notable surge in interest surrounding Shiba Inu. According to the analytics tool, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-records-surge-in-daily-new-addresses/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">SHIB</a>, the native token of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, is among the few meme coins witnessing both a rise in valuation and a surge in popularity lately. </p>

<p>Sharing a graphical representation of SHIB&#8217;s yearly interest over time, Google Trends disclosed a spike in global interest in <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-open-interest-40-crash/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Shiba Inu</a>, triggering a rise to some of the highest levels unseen in the past two years. </p>
<p>Presently, reports indicate that cryptocurrency has emerged as a focal point of interest for individuals across various countries. According to Google Trends, approximately 10 countries have been <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-whales-show-interest-positive-sign-shib/">displaying substantial interest in Shiba Inu</a>, contributing to its recent record high.</p>
<p>Countries like the Netherlands, Slovenia, Pakistan, Switzerland, Canada, Austria, Belgium and Nigeria have all played a role in driving Shiba Inu to its two-year peak in Google searches. Moreover, both the United States (US) and the United Kingdom (UK) have experienced a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shibarium-new-record/">surge in interest in Shiba Inu</a>, with investors and crypto enthusiasts alike showing great fascination with the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-whales-have-interest-in-shib-matic/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">doggy-themed meme coin.</a></p>
<h2>Why SHIB Is Becoming So Popular</h2>
<p>Since its inception in 2020,  Shiba Inu has been gaining a large amount of attention from investors and crypto enthusiasts alike. This elevated popularity is evident in its <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-founder-wallet/">thriving community</a> of supporters, boasting thousands of investors and advocates.</p>
<p>The unexpected rise in SHIB&#8217;s Google searches globally could be attributed to its recent <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-memecoins-3000-spike-volume-rally/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">price rallies</a> and the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-lead-dev-says-its-time-to-showcase-power/">ongoing development projects</a> within its ecosystem. In the last few months, Shiba Inu <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-blasts-into-top-10/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">witnessed a surge</a> of more than 200%, pushing its price up to the $0.00003 threshold. </p>

<p>However, following a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-shiba-inu-drop-15/">sharp correction</a>, the cryptocurrency has been trading well below its initial surge, currently at $0.000025, according to CoinMarketCap. Despite the decline, SHIB has been showing strong fundamentals, which is evident in the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shibarium-breaks-the-internet-again-with-over-400-million-layer-2-transactions/">rise in transactions on its Shibarium network</a> and the launch of the long-awaited <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shib-name-service-launch/">SHIB Name Service.  </a></p>
<p>The cryptocurrency has also succeeded in achieving the ranks of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-investing-meme-coins/">top 11 altcoins in the crypto space</a>, with a market capitalization of more than $14 billion. With current market sentiment, many analysts have also made <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/forget-dogecoin-shiba-inu-set-to-become-the-top-dog-expert-predicts-100-billion-market-cap/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">strong bullish projections</a> for the cryptocurrency, predicting that the meme coin could <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-dogecoin-shib-excitement/">surge to new all-time highs</a> during the 2024 bull run. </p>
<p>Shiba Inu’s future potential has also been confirmed by its lead developer, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-dogecoin-killer/">Shytoshi Kusama</a>, who believes that Shiba Inu could potentially overtake Dogecoin to finally become the “Dogecoin Killer.”</p>

<title>Bitcoin To Drop Even More If Prices Remain Below $70,300: Analyst</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-drop-prices-remain-below-70300/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-drop-prices-remain-below-70300/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。文章指出，如果牛市未能夺回70,300美元的支撑位置，比特币可能会下跌至59,000至62,000美元支撑区，这将导致价格从73,800美元的历史最高水平下跌20%。文章还提到了存在的并且有效的熊市分歧形态，并且强调了即将召开的美联储公开市场委员会（FOMC）会议对比特币价格的关键影响。此外，Grayscale出售更多比特币，现货ETF需求减弱，这可能对比特币产生负面影响。 <div>
<p>One analyst on X now thinks there is a high chance that Bitcoin will drop from spot levels to as low as the $59,000 to $62,000 support zone if bulls fail to reclaim $70,300. The drop will represent a 20% drop from all-time highs of $73,800.</p>
<h2>Eyes On FOMC After BoJ Shocker</h2>
<p>The analyst <a href="https://twitter.com/CryptoMichNL/status/1769996367521353898" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">noted</a> a &#8220;valid&#8221; bearish divergence formation in the Bitcoin daily chart. Whenever a divergence forms, it means that there is a disconnect between price and momentum. With bears currently in command, forcing prices lower, the odds of prices falling even lower beyond the current lows appear elevated. </p>
<img alt="Bitcoin price trading below $70,300 | Source: Analyst on X" class="size-full wp-image-288227" height="548" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GJBKUGCXAAAPauH.png?resize=1024%2C548" width="1024" />
<p>For the ongoing uptrend to persist and for bulls to breathe a sigh of relief, a robust close above $70,300 is necessary. This potential upswing could decelerate the current sell-off and align prices with the dominant trend over the past few months. </p>
<p>The trader&#8217;s evaluation indicates that several fundamental factors will shape the short-to-medium-term price trajectory. The most significant of these is the anticipated direction of monetary policy from the imminent Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting in the United States on [March 20], which could substantially impact Bitcoin&#8217;s price. </p>

<p>Ahead of this meeting, the Bank of Japan (BoJ), the central bank of Japan, raised interest rates for the first time since 2007, sending shockwaves across the market. That the BoJ is raising rates means the global financial conditions, despite optimism, are still tight. Of note, inflation in the country rose. However, the central bank said they plan to keep interest rates at the current levels as long as &#8220;financial conditions&#8221; remain constant.</p>
<h2>Grayscale Selling More Bitcoin, Spot ETF Demand Waning?</h2>
<p>Aside from monetary policy, analysts highlight that recent outflows from Grayscale, amounting to approximately $154 million on March 18, resulted in a total outflow for the first time since March 1. Data from Lookonchain <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1769791163983167603" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">indicates</a> that Grayscale, winding down its Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), released more coins than other spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) issuers purchased. </p>
<img alt="Grayscale unloading BTC | Source: Lookonchain via X" class="size-full wp-image-288226" height="768" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GI-Pn-agAEP5aS.png?resize=1024%2C768" width="1024" />
<p>Concurrently, the influx of capital into spot Bitcoin ETFs seems to be diminishing, a development that could be bearish for BTC. </p>

<p>Since its launch in January 2024, Bitcoin prices have been primarily propelled by demand for spot ETFs. </p>
<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/x/b7pGo1Sn/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Bitcoin price trending downward on the daily chart | Source: BTCUSDT on Binance, TradingView" class="size-full" height="904" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/b7pGo1Sn/" width="1787" /></a>
<p>For now, Bitcoin prices remain under immense selling pressure. The coin is edging lower, closer to the $60,000 round number. Whether or not bears will continue pressing prices lower remains to be seen. However, the broader crypto market remains bullish, and the upcoming halving event is expected to stir demand and lift prices.</p>

<title>Genesis Faces $21 Million Penalty As SEC Charges Are Settled</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/genesis-face-21-million-penalty-sec-charges-settled/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。<br />加密贷款商Genesis Global同意缴纳2100万美元的民事罚款并永久禁令，解决了与美国证券交易委员会(SEC)相关的未经注册的证券发售指控。SEC的调查发现，Genesis通过其加密资产借贷计划Gemini Earn程序进行了涉嫌的未经注册证券发售。Genesis已同意支付2100万美元的民事罚款，然而SEC将在所有其他允许的索赔，包括Gemini Earn程序的零售投资者索赔，在破产法院得到支付后才能获得其部分罚款。SEC主席Gary Gensler强调遵守证券法律的重要性，特别是对加密货币平台和中介机构。他指出，未注册这些产品并绕过披露要求并非可选，而是法定义务。 SEC执法部门主任Gurbir S. Grewal强调，没有炒作或广告可以代替证券法要求的投资者保护披露。Genesis还与纽约总检察长Letitia James提起的一起诉讼达成和解。目前，加密货币市场总价值出现6%下降，达到2.31万亿美元，同时，市场领头加密货币比特币(BTC)价格下跌6.6%，降至63000美元水平。 <div>
<p>Crypto lender Genesis Global, has agreed to a final judgment imposing a $21 million civil penalty and a permanent injunction as part of a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2024-37" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">settlement </a>with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). </p>
<p>The settlement resolves charges against Genesis related to the unregistered offer and sale of “securities” through its crypto asset lending program, the Gemini Earn program.</p>
<h2>Genesis Settles With SEC</h2>
<p>According to the SEC’s investigations, Genesis engaged in the alleged unregistered offer and sale of securities by operating the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/gemini-to-return-over-1-8b-to-earn-customers-in-regulatory-settlement/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Gemini Earn program</a> without proper registration. </p>

<p>The program allowed Gemini customers, including retail investors in the United States, to loan their <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/digital-currency-group-bankruptcy-code-violations/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">crypto assets</a> to Genesis in exchange for promised interest payments. However, in November 2022, Genesis announced that it could not honor withdrawal requests due to a lack of sufficient liquid assets following volatility in the crypto market.</p>
<p> At that time, Genesis held approximately $900 million in crypto assets from 340,000 Gemini Earn investors.</p>
<p>Genesis has agreed to pay a $21 million civil penalty for the settlement. However, the SEC will only receive its portion of the penalty after all other allowed claims, including those by retail investors in the Gemini Earn program, have been paid in the bankruptcy court. </p>
<p>Genesis and two of its affiliates had filed for voluntary <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/genesis-bankruptcy-plan-faces-criticism-dcg/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Chapter 11 bankruptcy</a> on January 19, 2023, in the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.</p>
<h2>Legal Challenges Resolved</h2>
<p>SEC Chair Gary Gensler emphasized the importance of compliance with securities laws by <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/genesis-reaches-1-billion-settlement-with-3ac/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">crypto lending platforms</a> and intermediaries. He stressed that failing to register such products and bypassing disclosure requirements is not optional but a legal obligation. Gensler further stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today’s settlement builds on previous actions to make clear to the marketplace and the investing public that crypto lending platforms and other intermediaries need to comply with our time-tested securities laws. Doing so best protects investors. It promotes trust in markets. It’s not optional. It’s the law.</p></blockquote>
<p>Similarly, Gurbir S. Grewal, Director of the SEC&#8217;s Division of Enforcement, emphasized that no hype or advertising can substitute for the investor protection disclosures required by the securities laws.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that Genesis has also settled a separate <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/genesis-resolves-lawsuit-with-ny-attorney-general/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">lawsuit </a>filed by New York Attorney General Letitia James. The lawsuit, which initially targeted Genesis, Digital Currency Group, and Gemini, accused them of defrauding customers of $1.1 billion. However, the settlement disclosed in the New York bankruptcy court focuses solely on Genesis.</p>
<img alt="Genesis" class="size-large" height="858" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/Xrt0B8Fg/" width="1815" />
<p>As of the time of writing, the total value of the cryptocurrency market has experienced a 6% decline, reaching a valuation of $2.31 trillion. Simultaneously, Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency in the market, has undergone a 6.6% price correction, decreasing towards the $63,000 price level.</p>

<title>Crypto Analyst Predicts Explosive Rally For Shiba Inu’s BONE With New Target</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-bone-new-target/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-bone-new-target/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章介绍了BONE代币在Shiba Inu生态系统中的表现，包括价格波动和交易量增加。加密分析师SHIB Knight预测BONE代币将出现爆炸性涨势，预计价格将飙升至3美元。文章提到了BONE代币当前价格走势和未来展望，认为随着Shiba Inu生态系统的扩大，BONE有望获得更多价值。此外，BONE代币即将在知名交易所上市，这可能会推动价格进一步上涨。 <div>
<p>BONE, the second-biggest token in the Shiba Inu ecosystem, has had a mixed price movement in the past few days. This up-and-down movement has been accompanied by a surge in trading volume. Crypto analyst SHIB Knight is calling for an <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shibarium-4400-shib-bone/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">explosive rally</a> soon that could send BONE skyrocketing. Notably, the analyst is predicting a surge to $3.  </p>
<h2>Crypto Analyst Predicts Explosive BONE Rally</h2>
<p>BONE recently went on a 32% surge from $0.8191 to $1.0808 to outperform the larger crypto market as most cryptocurrencies <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/btc/bitcoin-price-at-risk-65k/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">witnessed a decline in prices</a>. Interestingly, this surge was accompanied by a 60% increase in trading volume. </p>

<p>This surge in activity prompted a social media post from SHIB Knight. While acknowledging the rally, the analyst noted that the crypto is expected to “pump more.” The recent post came as an update to a former prediction over the weekend.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24BONE&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">$BONE</a> is having a nice pump rn. It will pump more! <img alt="🔥" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f525.png" style="height: 1em;" /><img alt="🚀" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f680.png" style="height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://t.co/ao3YvsrJzS" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://t.co/ao3YvsrJzS</a> <a href="https://t.co/P7HbIDVkmk" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/P7HbIDVkmk</a></p>
<p>— $SHIB KNIGHT (@army_shiba) <a href="https://twitter.com/army_shiba/status/1769693757870379212?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">March 18, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>In the chart shared by the analyst, he noted how BONE has been trading in a channel with the formation of lower highs. He also pointed out how BONE had tried to break out of the upper trendline of this channel earlier but failed to do so. However, he remains unfazed and believes a breakout to $3 will happen sooner or later, though he doesn&#8217;t say when.</p>
<h2>What’s Next For BONE?</h2>
<p>Recent price action indicates that BONE has once again failed to break out of this upper trendline, as it has gone in the direction of the <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bitcoin-news/bitcoin-undergone-bearish-analyst-explains/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">wider bearish trend</a> of <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/arbitrum/arbitrum-token-sell-off-whales-transfer-58m-to-exchanges-following-unlock-arb-price-reacts/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">most cryptocurrencies</a>. BONE has reversed most of its recent gains and has fallen by 20% in the past 24 hours and 22.3% in the past seven days. </p>
<p>At the time of writing, BONE is trading at $0.8638, and a surge to $3 would mean a 245% increase from the current price level. While this seems like a very bullish price point, the $3 price isn&#8217;t new territory for BONE, as it has a current all-time high of $15.50.</p>

<p>BONE acts as the governance token within the ShibaSwap decentralized ecosystem and as gas fees for Shibarium, Shiba Inu&#8217;s layer-2 scaling solution. <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-investing-meme-coins/">Team members</a> have proposed <a href="https://twitter.com/LucieSHIB/status/1769920586547867904?s=20" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">several developments</a> on the horizon that could significantly boost BONE&#8217;s price. Overall, BONE appears well-positioned to gain value as long as Shiba Inu&#8217;s ecosystem expands.</p>
<p>Despite its popularity, BONE is yet to be listed on popular exchanges <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-robinhood-bone/">like Robinhood</a> and Binance, and members of the “Shiba Army” have now taken it upon themselves to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bone-binance-shiba-inu-army-campaigns-for-listing/">campaign for a listing on Binance</a>. If successfully listed, the increased accessibility and visibility would likely lead to a price surge for BONE. Perhaps we could see <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/bone/shiba-inu-bone-explodes/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">increased BONE accumulation</a> from traders in the days leading up to the listing. </p>

<title>Elon Musk Sends Dogecoin Fans Into Frenzy With Cryptic Tweet</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/elon-musk-makes-another-cryptic-tweet/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/elon-musk-makes-another-cryptic-tweet/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章讨论了特斯拉创始人埃隆·马斯克在社交媒体上发布的有关梗币的推文引发的热烈讨论，以及他对人工智能领域的贡献。马斯克的推文历来备受争议，同时也对金融市场产生影响。他在Twitter上的行为和影响也引起关注，尤其是在他收购Twitter以来。 <div>
<p>Social media darling Elon Musk sent the meme-coin world into a tailspin with a seemingly innocuous St. Patrick&#8217;s Day tweet. The tech magnate, renowned for his affection for memes and his influence as &#8220;Dogefather&#8221;, posted a lighthearted image featuring three dogs adorned in festive green hats, one of them a Shiba Inu, the mascot of Dogecoin.</p>

<h2><strong>Memecoin Fans React To Elon Musk X Post</strong></h2>
<p>This seemingly casual social media activity sparked a vibrant response from the meme-coin community. Crypto accounts affiliated with Dogecoin, Floki Inu (FLOKI), and Shiba Inu (SHIB) flooded the replies with enthusiastic messages, some featuring their own canine mascots.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p></p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time Musk has, intentionally or unintentionally, impacted the meme-coin market. In 2021, a tweet showcasing his newly adopted Shiba Inu puppy, named Floki in homage to a character from Vikings, is believed to have triggered the launch of the Floki Inu coin. Interestingly, the same day witnessed the birth of Baby Doge Coin, further solidifying Musk&#8217;s reputation as a meme-coin kingmaker.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p></p>
<p>Meanwhile, as memecoin enthusiasts revelled in Musk&#8217;s festive tweet, the tech mogul was making significant strides on another technological front – Artificial Intelligence. His recently established company, xAI, has delivered on its earlier promise by open-sourcing Grok, its AI chatbot.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/bFxcyvE5/" width="1835" /></p>

<p>This move marks a significant contribution to the field of transparent AI development. By open-sourcing Grok, xAI has granted public access to the architecture and core functionalities of this mammoth 314 billion parameter language model.</p>
<h2><strong>Musk&#8217;s Twitter Impact: From Controversy To Financial Market Influence</strong></h2>
<p>The tweets made by Elon Musk have been <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-community-abuzz-musk-x-post/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">a subject of significant attention</a> and controversy due to their impact and content. Musk, a prolific tweeter with a massive following, has a history of posting tweets that have stirred both positive and negative reactions. Over the years, Musk has been known to delete tweets shortly after posting them, with hundreds being removed within hours of publication. </p>
<p>Notably, some of his tweets have led to serious consequences, such as the infamous tweet in 2018 where he claimed to have secured funding to take Tesla private at $420 a share, resulting in charges from the Securities and Exchange Commission and a subsequent settlement that imposed restrictions on his Twitter activity regarding Tesla.</p>

<p>The billionaire&#8217;s acquisition of Twitter and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/musk-x-rebrand-for-twitter-opposed/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">subsequent actions</a> as the platform&#8217;s owner have also drawn attention. Since taking over Twitter, Musk has expressed his commitment to free speech and diversifying voices on the platform. </p>
<p>However, despite his intentions, his Twitter feed has been criticized for often acting as an echo chamber, where he interacts mainly with accounts that support him or post about him.</p>
<p>This behavior has raised concerns about how Twitter may evolve under his leadership. Moreover, his tweets have had a direct impact on financial markets. Several instances stand out where his tweets influenced Tesla&#8217;s stock prices significantly. </p>
<p>For example, Musk&#8217;s tweet questioning Hertz Global Holdings Inc.&#8217;s deal to buy Teslas for its rental-car fleet led to a 3% drop in Tesla&#8217;s stock the following day. Similarly, his tweets about Tesla&#8217;s valuation or production predictions have caused fluctuations in the company&#8217;s stock prices.</p>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。微战略公司宣布用可转换票据和多余现金收购了9245个比特币，从而将公司持有的比特币总数增加到214,246个。该公司完成了一笔私人可转换票据的增发，总额达6.0375亿美元，引起市场广泛关注。Michael Saylor表达了对比特币的信心，并表示计划继续收购。社区对微战略公司的最新收购表示赞赏。击贬币 。. <div>
<p>On Tuesday, MicroStrategy announced the acquisition of an additional 9,245 BTC for approximately $623.0 million, using proceeds from convertible notes and excess cash. This purchase brings the company&#8217;s total holdings to 214,246 BTC. This figure represents more than 1.0% of the total 21 million Bitcoin that will ever exist, marking a significant milestone for both MicroStrategy and the community at large.</p>
<p>Michael Saylor, the CEO of MicroStrategy, <a href="https://twitter.com/saylor/status/1770061111146033385" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">shared</a> the news on X (formerly Twitter), stating, &#8220;MicroStrategy has acquired an additional 9,245 BTC for ~$623.0M using proceeds from convertible notes &amp; excess cash for ~$67,382 per #bitcoin. As of 3/18/24, MSTR hodls 214,246 BTC acquired for ~$7.53B at average price of $35,160 per bitcoin.”</p>
<p>The funding for this significant acquisition came from a private offering of convertible senior notes, which concluded with an upsized aggregate principal amount of $603.75 million. This offering attracted substantial interest, leading to an oversubscription and the exercise of an option by initial purchasers to buy an additional $78.75 million worth of notes.</p>

<p>According to MicroStrategy&#8217;s official <a href="https://www.microstrategy.com/press/microstrategy-completes-603-million-offering-of-0875-convertible-senior-notes-due-2031_03-19-2024" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a>, &#8220;The Offering, which included a 0.875% coupon and an approximately 40% conversion premium over the US composite volume weighted average price of MicroStrategy’s class A common stock, was well received in the marketplace.&#8221;</p>
<p>The convertible notes, due in 2031, offer flexibility to holders with rights for early repurchase and conversion into cash, shares of MicroStrategy&#8217;s class A common stock, or a combination thereof under specific conditions. This innovative financial instrument reflects <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/microstrategy-bitcoin-bet-btc/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">MicroStrategy&#8217;s sophisticated approach</a> to capital management and its bullish outlook on Bitcoin.</p>
<h2>The Bitcoin Community Reacts</h2>
<p>The community has lauded MicroStrategy&#8217;s latest acquisition. Bitcoin Munger <a href="https://twitter.com/bitcoinmunger/status/1770059884085621201" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">commented</a>, “Saylor is like a kid in a candy store with this current dip. Still surprised that the market would give him this dip, but coins are moving from lettuce hands to diamond hands.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, prominent figures like Dylan LeClair and WhalePanda have acknowledged the company&#8217;s significant market position, with LeClair <a href="https://twitter.com/DylanLeClair_/status/1770061493922382059" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">stating</a>, “&gt;1.0% of 21,000,000 Bitcoin. Congrats Saylor &amp; MicroStrategy. Legendary,” and WhalePanda <a href="https://twitter.com/WhalePanda/status/1770059536847536163" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">adding</a>, “Saylor thanks you for your weak hands.”</p>

<p>MicroStrategy&#8217;s aggressive accumulation of BTC not only demonstrates its confidence in the digital currency as a viable investment asset but also could have significant impact on market dynamics. This milestone of holding more than 1% of all BTC&#8217;s in existence is a monumental step for Saylor.</p>
<p>More recently, Michael Saylor&#8217;s bet on BTC was compared to Nelson Bunker Hunt&#8217;s historical attempt to corner the silver market. Both invested heavily with the conviction that their chosen asset (<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/rap-star-drake-bitcoin-to-the-masses/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">BTC for Saylor</a>, silver for the Hunts) was undervalued and poised for significant appreciation. Each believed strongly in the future value of their chosen asset, seeing it as a hedge against economic uncertainty and inflation.</p>

<p></p>
<p>In a recent <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/microstrategy-bitcoin-end-game-saylor-plan/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">interview</a>, Saylor proclaimed that he has no plans to sell BTC. “We think Bitcoin is the highest form of property, the apex property in the world, and it’s the best investment asset, so the end game is to acquire more Bitcoin. Whoever gets the most Bitcoin wins. There is no other end game,” Saylor said.</p>
<p>At press time, BTC traded at $63,723.</p>

<title>Mega Bank Says Ethereum Price Could Reach $14,000, Here’s Why</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-price-reach-14000/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。标准银行预测以太坊价格将飙升至14,000美元，主要受到美国证券交易委员会可能批准以太坊现货交易所交易基金的驱动。分析师预计，如果SEC批准ETH ETF，以太坊价格将在2025年前达到14,000美元。预测还涉及到以太坊ETF将带来450亿美元的资金流入市场。此外，以太坊2.0升级和投资者对加密货币的需求也将推动以太坊价格上涨。 <div>
<p>Leading international cross-border bank, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/standard-chartered-sees-bitcoin-200k/">Standard Chartered</a> has made another bullish prediction for Ethereum. According to analysts from the bank, ETH could see a rise to new all-time highs, driven by the potential introduction of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/approval-denial-ethereum-etf-sell-the-news-event/">Spot ETH Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). </a></p>
<h2>ETH Price Set To Rise To $14,000</h2>
<p>Analysts at Standard Chartered Bank have maintained an <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-takes-hit-3680/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">optimistic outlook for ETH</a>, anticipating that the second-largest cryptocurrency could witness an exponential surge to $14,000 by 2025. </p>

<p>Detailed in a Monday note, the analysts revealed <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-aims-for-10000-driven-by-2-key-factors-according-to-experts/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">key factors</a> that could drive Ethereum towards the predicted price target. Notably, the potential <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-etf-issuers-brace-for-sec-march-meeting/">approval of an Ethereum Spot ETF</a> by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is a primary catalyst for ETH&#8217;s projected surge. </p>
<p>According to the analysts at Standard Chartered, if the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/coinbase-sec-5-arguments-spot-ethereum-etf/">SEC greenlights Spot Ethereum ETFs</a>, ETH could follow a straight road map to <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/standard-chartered-bitcoin-ethereum-prediction-year-end/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">$8,000 by the end of 2024</a> and $14,000 by 2025. The analysts have maintained an optimistic outlook regarding the approval of Ethereum Spot ETFs, anticipating the SEC’s authorization by May 2024. </p>
<p>The firm emphasized yet another significant factor that could propel the price of ETH to $14,000 &#8211; <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-finalizes-dencun-upgrade-on-testnets/">Ethereum’s recent Dencun upgrade. </a>Geoffrey Kendrick, Standard Chartered’s Head of Forex and Crypto Research anticipates an influx of demand for the cryptocurrency, citing potential <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-fees-spike-but-relief-on-the-horizon/">reduction in transaction costs</a> and improvements to the Ethereum blockchain facilitated by upgrade as key drivers.</p>
<h2>Ethereum Spot ETFs Projected To Draw $45 Billion</h2>
<p>In addition to his <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/ethereum/ethereum-new-5000-target/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">bullish projections for ETH</a>, Kendrick has also stated that Spot Ethereum ETFs could trigger a whopping $45 billion in inflows into the market. While there has been a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/cloudy-future-for-ethereum-etfs-whats-casting-doubt-on-their-fate/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">decline in overall optimism</a> regarding the SEC’s potential approval of Ethereum ETFs by May, the analyst has maintained a positive outlook, affirming the possibility of the SEC granting approval for these investment assets by the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sec-bitcoin-ethereum-etfs-deadline/">specified deadline</a> of May 23, 2024. </p>

<p>According to Kendrick’s insights shared with The Block, he has estimated inflows ranging from $15 billion to $45 billion within the first 12 months following the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-etfs-approval-odds-drop-to-35/">approval of Spot ETH ETFs. </a></p>
<p>The crypto analyst indicated that he intends to apply the same methodology for estimating <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-etfs-new-ath-inflows-coinbase-reserves/">Spot Bitcoin ETF inflows</a> in his analysis. His reasoning suggests a similar trajectory for ETH&#8217;s future outlook as witnessed with Bitcoin following its ETF approval. </p>
<p>Just as millions of dollars poured into the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/without-spot-bitcoin-etfs-btc-down-20-founder/">Spot Bitcoin ETF</a> market after the SEC’s acceptance, a similar scenario could potentially unfold for Ethereum if its ETF is authorized. In such an event, the price of the cryptocurrency could witness a significant rise to <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/analysis/eth/ethereum-price-rally-4k/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">new all-time highs</a>, propelled by a surge in investor interest and capital inflows.</p>

<title>This Signal Points To End Of Bull Phase For Bitcoin, Quant Says</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/signal-points-end-bull-phase-bitcoin-quant-says/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> 摘要：<br /><br />这些信息是消极的。一位量化分析师指出比特币在链指标NUPL显示出了一个可能暗示牛市可能接近尾声的模式。NUPL指标显示投资者持有的未实现利润或损失数量，最近已经进入过热水平多周。历史数据表明，当NUPL超过0.6水平时，比特币往往会出现顶部和价格回调。当前NUPL处于“过热”区域已经将近3周，这可能预示着比特币可能面临更强烈的价格调整。比特币目前交易于约63,000美元，过去一周下跌12%。 <div>
<p>A quant has pointed out a pattern in a Bitcoin on-chain indicator that may imply the bull phase may be close to ending for now.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin NUPL Has Been At Overheated Levels For Weeks Now</h2>
<p>In a CryptoQuant Quicktake <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/65f89926bcdd3c42d0a27b8c-Another-sign-of-bull-phase-ending" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, an analyst has talked about a bearish development that has recently occurred in the Bitcoin &#8220;<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/the-bitcoin-bull-cycle-is-underway-analyst-confirms/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Net Unrealized Profit/Loss</a>&#8221; (NUPL) indicator.</p>
<p>As its name already suggests, the NUPL keeps track of the net amount of unrealized profit or loss that the investors of the cryptocurrency as a whole are holding right now. This metric works by going through the on-chain history of each token in circulation to see what price it was last moved at.</p>

<p>With the assumption that the previous transfer for any coin was the last point it changed hands, the metric subtracts the price at its time from the current price to find the exact amount of profit or loss it is currently carrying.</p>
<p>The indicator then sums up these values for the entire circulating supply to determine the net profit/loss status of the market. Naturally, positive values imply the investors as a whole are in the green, while values under zero imply the dominance of underwater supply.</p>
<p>Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the Bitcoin NUPL over the past few years:</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin NUPL" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="975" src="https://i0.wp.com/img.cryptoquant.com/322923/quicktake/qnGDqmBB0_4ade16ab9a5ca400aa560adf3c6692e22209f53fe4253aa66145fc2399c8b36f.png?resize=1680%2C975&#038;ssl=1" width="1680" /></p>

<p>As displayed in the above graph, the Bitcoin NUPL has attained highly positive levels recently, which is obviously a natural conclusion of the sharp rally the cryptocurrency has gone through.</p>
<p>During this surge, the indicator has managed to breach the 0.6 level. The quant has pointed out, however, that historically, it has been quite rare that the asset has been able to sustain above this mark.</p>
<p>This pattern is visible in the chart, as tops have often been encountered as the NUPL has crossed this boundary. Only periods where the indicator did manage to continue to surge past this level in recent years was during the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/founder-btc-bitcoin-bull-run-just-getting-started/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">bull runs</a> in 2017 and first half 2021.</p>
<p>Even the November 2021 price all-time high (ATH) was hit not too long after the indicator entered this territory of overheating. &#8220;We have been in the &#8220;overbought&#8221; zone for almost 3 weeks now and in the past it took between 3 to 6 weeks before a stronger correction in price occurred,&#8221; notes the analyst.</p>

<p>Thus, going by this historical pattern, it&#8217;s possible that a steep correction may be coming for Bitcoin in the near future, or it may have even already started considering the recent price plunge.</p>
<p>Usually, investors in profit are more likely to sell their coins and this tendency to sell goes up the more their profits swell. This is why historically the asset has been probable to see <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-inflows-binance-spike-whales-2024-selloff/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">selloffs</a> at high values of the NUPL.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading at around $63,000, down 12% over the past week.</p>

<title>Fidelity Adjusts Ethereum ETF Application, Optimistic About Regulatory Approval</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/fidelity-adjusts-ethereum-etf-application/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/fidelity-adjusts-ethereum-etf-application/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章讨论了多个金融管理公司申请以太坊现货ETF产品的情况。财务管理公司Fidelity修改了其申请，展现出对美国证券交易委员会（SEC）批准的信心。该更新包含对现货和期货市场之间联系的更彻底的考察。此外，Grayscale也更新了其以太坊ETF提案，这对于将ETHE上市至NYSE Arca是一个关键步骤。最后，文章提到了Fidelity计划允许交易者在其提议的以太坊基金中抵押资产的计划，以及提到了以太坊网络奖励的相关信息。 <div>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-etfs-jeopardy-staking-yields-bitmex/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Spot Ethereum Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)</a> may be witnessing a decline in approval odds, but there is still a wave of optimism among several financial management firms applying for the products.</p>
<h2>Fidelity Amends Its Ethereum Spot ETF Application</h2>
<p>Amid the anticipation encompassing the Ethereum spot ETFs, financial management giant <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sec-delays-fidelity-spot-ethereum-etf/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Fidelity</a> has recently amended its application for the exchange products, demonstrating confidence toward approval by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</p>



<p>Chairman and President of The ETF Store, Nate Geraci, took to the social media platform X to <a href="https://x.com/NateGeraci/status/1769893614576980281?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">share</a> the update with the crypto community today. According to Nate Geraci, the amendment contains a &#8220;more thorough examination&#8221; of the connection between the spot and futures markets.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that Fidelity entered the competition to introduce an Ethereum ETF in November last year. Other applicants for the ETFs include Grayscale, Ark Invest, 21Shares, and BlackRock, among others.</p>
<p>Geraci mentioned that the update cites the acceptance of a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/4-bitcoin-etfs-get-nod-190-billion-wealth-manager/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">spot Bitcoin ETF</a>. He also shared a screenshot from the latest filing, while noting that the passage is the &#8220;money page.&#8221; This is because the &#8220;SEC will not be let off the hook by Ethereum ETFs issuers.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the filing, Fidelity claims that &#8220;given the firm correlation between Ethereum and Bitcoin futures offered by Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME), applying the same grounds that the SEC used to approval a spot Bitcoin product suggests that the test is satisfied for this proposal.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the &#8220;SEC anticipates that the CME&#8217;s surveillance will help identify potential instances of deceptive and manipulative acts,&#8221; the financial firm argues that &#8220;<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-analyst-bullish-on-ethereum-and-xrp/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ethereum </a>ETFs should be identified using the same logic.&#8221;</p>
<p>By updating its application, Fidelity plans to permit traders and users in its proposed Ethereum fund to stake a portion of the assets. The Registration Statement <a href="https://cdn.cboe.com/resources/regulation/rule_filings/pending/2023/SR-CboeBZX-2023-095-Amendment-No-1.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">states</a> that the &#8220;Sponsor may occasionally stake a portion of the Fund&#8217;s assets through one or more reputable staking providers, some of whom may be Sponsor affiliates or Staking Providers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Additionally, &#8220;the Fund would get specific network rewards in the form of Ether tokens&#8221; for any staking activity it might perform. These rewards could be considered as &#8220;income for the Fund&#8221; as compensation for the services rendered. </p>
<h2>Grayscale Updates Its ETH ETF Proposal</h2>
<p>Fidelity is the latest firm to amend its Ethereum spot ETF application after financial behemoth Grayscale. On Friday, Grayscale <a href="https://x.com/CraigSalm/status/1768750794021511218?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reported</a> that the firm had updated its proposal for the products, which marks a vital step in uplisting ETHE to NYSE Arca.</p>

<p>As with spot Bitcoin ETFs, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-funds-lose-500m-as-grayscales-outflow-wanes/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Grayscale</a> thinks the case for spot ETH ETFs is just as strong, and investors demand and deserve exposure to ETH in this aspect.</p>
<p>In compliance with the guidelines mentioned in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, Section 19(b) and Rule 19b-4, NYSE Arca intends to list and trade the shares of the following under NYSE rule 8.201.</p>

<title>Why Is The Shiba Inu Price Down Today?</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-price-down-today/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-price-down-today/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是负面的。<br />在过去的一天里，由于比特币价格失去了65000美元的支撑，Shiba Inu遭受了巨大的下跌。这次市场崩溃部分是对即将于3月20日星期三举行的美联储公开市场委员会（FOMC）的反应。Shiba Inu的价格跌幅超过10%，市场遭受了严重打击。然而，一位分析师认为，尽管目前的状况不佳，Shiba Inu仍然表现出强大的力量，并预计它将很快反弹。 <div>
<p class="p2">The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-investing-meme-coins/">Shiba Inu price</a> has seen a massive drawdown in the last day as the Bitcoin price lost its support at $65,000. As a result, the SHIB price is down more than 10% in a single day, with what is arguably one of the worst crypto trading days in crypto so far this year. But what is behind this market crash?</p>
<h2 class="p2">Crypto Market Fumbles On FOMC</h2>
<p class="p2">The crypto market seems to be already reacting to the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">meeting</a> which is scheduled to take place on Wednesday, March 20. Expectations are quite lax for the outcome of the meeting. Nevertheless, investors and traders are looking toward the outcome as something that could significantly impact the crypto market.</p>

<p class="p2">Alongside this, Bitcoin is also going through an expected correction after what has been a green year, moving from $20,000 to a new all-time high above $73,000. As <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoins-price-trajectory-analyst-spells-out-three/">the Bitcoin price</a> sees a correction through this crash, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-burn-rate-2300/">likes of Shiba Inu</a> have also seen their prices correct sharply as well.</p>
<p class="p2">Shiba Inu’s double-digit losses have triggered a decline toward $0.000052, eliminating around 50% of its gains from the last month. Likewise, the daily trading volume of the meme coin has taken a significant hit as well, with CoinMarketCap data showing a 28.4% crash to bring its daily trading volume to $1.73 billion.</p>
<p class="p2">The meme coin is down more than 22% on the weekly chart as well, which has brought its market cap to $14.89 billion. As a result of this, Shiba Inu continues to lag as the 11th-largest cryptocurrency in the world behind rival <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-shiba-inu-drop-15/">Dogecoin</a>, which sits in the 10th spot.</p>
<h2 class="p2">What’s Next For Shiba Inu?</h2>
<p class="p2">For now, the whole crypto market, including Shiba Inu, looks to be following Bitcoin’s lead. This means that any further decline or recovery in the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-burn-rate-2300/">SHIB price</a> will be directly tied to the outcome for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-targets-500000-scary-dips/">Bitcoin</a>, and since <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoins-price-trajectory-analyst-spells-out-three/">BTC</a> is currently in its pre-halving crash, it might continue to struggle until the halving in April.</p>

<p class="p2">However, this has not affected the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-price-0-0001-target/">bullish outlook</a> that investors have for the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-shiba-inu-drop-15/">SHIB price</a> as one analyst believes that this is only a temporary setback. Crypto Analyst Javon Marks took to X (formerly Twitter) to <a href="https://x.com/JavonTM1/status/1768049122290929876?s=20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reveal</a> that Shiba Inu has shown massive strength since 2023. But there is still more to go.</p>
<p class="p2">Marks continues to stand by his breakout target of $0.000081 for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-investing-meme-coins/">SHIB</a>, which from current price levels, would see it do another 350% move to get there. So while <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-price-0-0001-target/">SHIB</a> has suffered in the last day, expectations are that it will turnaround soon.</p>

This event signifies a crucial advancement for the XRP Ledger and its ecosystem, offering a new layer of stability and efficiency for cross-border and domestic transactions.</p>
<h2>Ripple Praises New BRL Stablecoin</h2>
<p>“Designed to facilitate seamless and cost-effective transactions, BRLA Token offers businesses a reliable avenue for both domestic and international payments. The team has been exploring and testing the XRP Ledger extensively for payment processing, with much more excitement on the horizon,” RippleX stated in a blog post.</p>
<p>BRLA Digital, spearheading this innovation, aims to disrupt the traditional <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/is-brazil-ready-for-the-crypto-economy-the-data-agrees-vehemently/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">financial sector in Brazil</a>. Their creation, the BRLA Token, is crafted to simplify and economize business transactions, both internationally and within the country.</p>
<p>RippleX&#8217;s enthusiasm about this collaboration is evident. In a <a href="https://twitter.com/RippleXDev/status/1769830638817821006" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">statement</a> shared on X (formerly Twitter), they remarked, &#8220;BRLA Digital&#8217;s commitment to evolving Brazil&#8217;s financial scene comes to fruition with the BRLA Token. This venture into stablecoins signifies a pivotal stride towards redefining business transactions in Brazil.&#8221;</p>

<p>This initiative by BRLA Digital to bring the BRLA Token to the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-ledger-partnership-to-integrate-smart-contracts/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">XRP Ledger</a> showcases an ambitious effort to bridge the gap between conventional financial services and the burgeoning field of digital currency. Focusing on business-to-business (B2B) transactions, the move is designed to streamline payment processes, making them more accessible and less susceptible to the unpredictability of cryptocurrency markets.</p>
Key Features Of The BRLA Token
<p>Central to the value proposition of the BRLA Token is its foundation in stability. &#8220;By anchoring the BRLA Token&#8217;s value to the Brazilian Real and backing it with audited reserves, we ensure a stable and reliable medium for transactions, shielding businesses from the whims of cryptocurrency volatility,&#8221; explains Ripple. This stability is crucial for businesses seeking consistency in their financial operations.</p>
<p>Transparency is another pillar upon which the BRLA Token stands. &#8220;Our commitment to transparency is unwavering, with regular, audited transparency reports that reaffirm the token&#8217;s solid backing,&#8221; BRLA Digital asserts. This openness is intended to build trust among users, reassuring them of the token&#8217;s integrity and the security of their transactions.</p>

<p>Regarding security, Ripple emphasizes the decentralized and secure nature of the BRLA Token transactions on the blockchain. &#8220;We leverage Brazil&#8217;s safest asset class, government treasury bills, through the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/brazil-itau-unibanco-launche-bitcoin-ethereum-trade/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">nation&#8217;s most reputable banks</a>, ensuring the utmost security and integrity of the BRLA Token&#8217;s backing,&#8221; they note.</p>
Transforming Brazilian Payments
<p>RippleX&#8217;s blog post further illuminates the innovation the BRLA Token brings to the financial sector: &#8220;The BRLA Token not only facilitates transactional efficiency but also spearheads the development of decentralized applications rooted in the Brazilian Real, heralding a new era of financial solutions on the blockchain.&#8221;</p>
<p>The team behind BRLA Digital, comprising industry veterans like Matheus Moura, Luiz Castelo Branco, Lucas Giorgio, Hector Fardin, and Leandro Noel, is celebrated by Ripple for their combined expertise in finance, technology, and entrepreneurship. Their collective experiences, enriched by past ventures and academic achievements at the Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica (ITA), fuel their mission to revolutionize Brazil&#8217;s financial infrastructure.</p>
<p>At press time, XRP traded at $0.5852.</p>

<title>Crypto Exchange OKX Delists USDT Trading In Europe – Here’s Why</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。OKX决定在欧洲经济区停止交易对，以配合即将出台的MiCA法规，并专注于欧元流动性。此举符合行业日益加强的监管趋势。OKX还推出OKX Argentina，并希望成为该地区的重要参与者。尽管可能存在一些准备不足的问题，但OKX的积极举措显示了对监管遵从的重视。 <div>
<p>In a strategic move ahead of regulatory changes, OKX, the fourth-largest global cryptocurrency exchange, has decided to discontinue <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">USDT</a> trading pairs in the European Economic Area (EEA).</p>
<p>The decision, aimed at aligning with forthcoming Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulations, reflects the exchange&#8217;s focus on euro-denominated liquidity within the region. OKX aims to become the preferred venue for euro to crypto spot trading and plans to expand its product offering in the EEA by introducing a variety of Euro fiat onramps and Euro pairs.</p>

<h2><strong>OKX Aligns with MiCA: USDT Trading Suspension Signals Compliance Efforts</strong></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-18/crypto-exchange-okx-to-pull-tether-trading-pairs-in-europe" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">discontinuation of USDT trading pairs</a> is expected to impact users located in the EEA, and the prohibition will be fully enforced until December 30, 2024. This move signifies a proactive stance by OKX and other exchanges towards complying with local and international financial regulations, particularly in light of the MiCA framework.</p>
<p>MiCA is a comprehensive regulatory approach aiming to govern stablecoins like USDT, protect the European Union&#8217;s financial ecosystem, and foster innovation in the fintech sector.</p>

<p></p>
<p>While the impact of these regulatory actions on the cryptocurrency market remains uncertain, OKX&#8217;s decision reflects a growing trend towards increased regulatory adherence in the industry.</p>
<p>However, there have been concerns regarding a lack of reconciliation between the removal of USDT from EEA traders and the information previously stated on the OKX website. Some speculate that this discrepancy indicates potential unpreparedness on the part of the exchange for the upcoming regulatory changes.</p>
<h2><strong>Regulatory Pressure Mounts: OKX USDT Trading Halt Signals EU Concerns</strong></h2>
<p>USDT is currently the largest stablecoin in terms of trading volume, serving as a vital infrastructure for crypto trading on centralized exchanges. The discontinuation of USDT trading pairs by OKX could foreshadow potential regulatory headwinds for the world&#8217;s most popular stablecoin within the EU.</p>
<p>As the MiCA framework is set to be implemented later this year, the EU&#8217;s dedication to increased supervision of cryptocurrencies is evident, raising questions about the future utility and popularity of digital assets in the region.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/SGg54CG0/" width="2475" /></p>

<p>In response to the regulatory changes in Europe, OKX has been expanding its global footprint and exploring new strategic approaches. Recently, the exchange launched OKX Argentina, introducing a crypto wallet and digital asset platform tailored to the region.</p>
<p>The expansion includes a peer-to-peer (P2P) network that enables customers to purchase cryptocurrencies directly from verified local sources. OKX&#8217;s user-centric approach and integration of popular local payment methods aim to accelerate adoption and address the specific needs of Argentine residents.</p>

<p>Hong Fang, the President of OKX, emphasized the significance of the expansion and its role in OKX&#8217;s regional growth strategy. By focusing on local requirements and providing Spanish-speaking support, OKX aims to facilitate crypto adoption in Argentina and establish itself as a key player in the market.</p>
<p>As OKX discontinues USDT trading pairs in Europe, other cryptocurrency exchanges are also expected to take similar steps towards regulatory compliance. The cryptocurrency industry as a whole appears to be shifting its focus towards adhering to financial regulations, reflecting a broader trend in the market.</p>
<p>The true impact of these regulatory actions on the crypto market will only become apparent over time, but OKX&#8217;s proactive measures indicate a growing emphasis on regulatory adherence and a changing landscape for digital assets in Europe.</p>

<title>Due To Ethereum Bias: Govt. Watchdog Sues SEC Over ‘ETH Gate’</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-watchdog-sues-sec-over-eth-gate/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-watchdog-sues-sec-over-eth-gate/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。Empower Oversight对证券交易委员会（SEC）提起诉讼，指控其未能遵守《信息自由法》的请求。调查SEC对加密货币（尤其是以太坊）监管的不一致性和透明度。'ETH Gate'争议涉及前SEC官员William Hinman和Jay Clayton的行动和言论。Empower Oversight的FOIA请求旨在揭露SEC与加密货币之间的潜在偏见和道德违规。SEC被指控拖延并未能进行搜索，导致多起诉讼。这些法律斗争可能对未来的监管政策产生重要影响。以太坊（ETH）目前交易在3376美元。 <div>
<p>Empower Oversight, a government watchdog organization, has <a href="https://empowr.us/empower-oversight-sues-sec-for-more-crypto-conflict-documents/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">filed</a> a lawsuit against the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), accusing the agency of failing to comply with a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. This request aimed to uncover potential conflicts of interest and biases within the SEC concerning its regulation of cryptocurrencies, particularly Ethereum.</p>
<h2>Investigation Into SEC&#8217;s Ethereum Dealings Continue</h2>
<p>The dealings, commonly referred to as &#8216;<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-army-clues-hinman-ethereum-free-pass-ripple/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">ETH Gate</a>,&#8217; highlight deepening concerns over the consistency and transparency of the SEC&#8217;s approach to digital asset regulation.In a public statement, Tristan Leavitt, President of Empower Oversight, criticized the SEC&#8217;s handling of their FOIA request:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>By slow walking their response to our FOIA request, the SEC is stonewalling Empower’s oversight into SEC officials with conflicts of interest on cryptocurrency issues. The public has a right to see all documents that relate to how these public officials violated ethics guidance and how the agency failed to hold them accountable.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The core of the &#8216;ETH Gate&#8217; controversy revolves around the actions and speeches of two key former SEC figures: William Hinman, the Director of the Division of Corporate Finance from May 2017 to December 2020, and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-spot-etf-inevitable/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Jay Clayton</a>, former SEC Chairman.</p>

<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-clo-demands-answers-from-sec/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Hinman&#8217;s June 14, 2018, speech</a>, where he publicly stated that Ethereum (ETH) was not considered a security by the SEC, has been a focal point of scrutiny. This position seemingly contradicted the SEC&#8217;s later aggressive stance against Ripple Labs&#8217; XRP, which the SEC classified as a security towards the end of Clayton&#8217;s tenure.</p>
<p>Empower Oversight&#8217;s FOIA requests, initiated in August 2021, sought to uncover the extent of potential biases and ethical violations within the SEC&#8217;s dealings with cryptocurrencies. The organization&#8217;s investigation was partly spurred by revelations about Hinman&#8217;s financial ties to his former employer, Simpson Thacher, which is known to have interests in promoting Ethereum.</p>
<p>These revelations raised questions about the impartiality of the SEC&#8217;s regulatory actions and the potential for conflicts of interest at the highest levels of the agency.</p>
<p>Despite the SEC&#8217;s initial agreement to search for relevant records based on terms provided by Empower Oversight, the agency has been accused of stalling and failing to conduct these searches, leading to multiple lawsuits aimed at compelling the SEC to release the requested documents. Empower Oversight&#8217;s persistent legal efforts have so far resulted in the SEC turning over 324 pages of documents following a lawsuit related to a December 2022 <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-sec-xrp-foia-request-jp-morgan-delayed/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">FOIA request</a>.</p>

<p>The latest lawsuit filed by Empower Oversight in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia seeks to enforce compliance with this December 2022 FOIA request. Leavitt&#8217;s communication on X (formerly Twitter) emphasizes the broader stakes of their campaign: &#8220;Empower Oversight has filed a new lawsuit against the SEC because of its refusal to comply with FOIA. #ethgate [&#8230;] So the fight continues for transparency, without which accountability is never possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8216;ETH Gate&#8217; not only exposes potential conflicts of interest and selective enforcement within the SEC but also raises significant questions about the agency&#8217;s regulatory framework and its impact on the crypto market. As this legal battle unfolds, it promises to provide critical insights into the SEC&#8217;s internal decision-making processes, potentially influencing future regulatory policies and the landscape of digital asset regulation.</p>
<p>At press time, Ethereum (ETH) traded at $3,376.</p>

<title>Debt Box Fallout: Judge Penalizes SEC For ‘Abuse Of Power’ Over Crypto Firm</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/debt-box-judge-penalizes-sec-for-abuse-of-power/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/debt-box-judge-penalizes-sec-for-abuse-of-power/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。一位联邦法官对美国证券交易委员会（SEC）在诉讼中对犹他州加密公司Debt Box进行处理的方式进行了尖锐的谴责。法官认为SEC在获取临时限制令时采取了“恶意行为”和“权力滥用”，并对他们加以制裁。这一裁决对加密交易所和SEC在加里·根斯勒主持下的执法记录都有重大影响。此外，裁决还引发了对SEC使用临时限制令的严重问题，并可能对其监管方法产生影响。最后，法官的裁决并不是针对Debt Box公司的有罪或无罪，诉讼仍在继续。 <div>
<p>In a scathing rebuke, a federal judge has sanctioned the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for its handling of a lawsuit against Utah-based crypto firm Debt Box. The case, which has become a lightning rod for the crypto industry, exposes the<a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/sec-blasted-by-judge-for-gross-abuse-of-power-in-crypto-case-1.2048545" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> SEC&#8217;s aggressive enforcement tactics</a> and raises questions about the agency&#8217;s use of legal tools.</p>

<p>The saga began in July 2023 when the SEC accused DEBT Box of defrauding investors out of nearly $50 million by selling unregistered securities in the form of &#8220;node licenses&#8221; for crypto mining.</p>
<p>In a dramatic move, the agency secured a temporary restraining order (TRO) freezing Debt Box&#8217;s assets. This extraordinary measure, typically used when a defendant poses a flight risk or could destroy evidence, was granted without notifying the company.</p>
<h2><strong>SEC Rebuked: Judge Ruling Favors Debt Box In Dispute Over Misrepresentation</strong></h2>
<p>However, Debt Box fiercely contested the SEC&#8217;s narrative. They claimed the agency misrepresented key facts to obtain the TRO, alleging the exchange was not aware of the investigation and had no intention of fleeing the country.</p>
<p><a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/c5bd0wqjc7v0/1u6cDaFa3REg8wHUc6onZ8/e1257f64a80ca440d887f67821f872fe/Debt_Box_Order.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Judge Robert Shelby</a>, after reviewing the evidence, agreed. In a December order, he slammed the SEC&#8217;s actions as &#8220;bad faith conduct&#8221; and a &#8220;gross abuse of power.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><img alt="🚨" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f6a8.png" style="height: 1em;" /> <a href="https://twitter.com/GaryGensler?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">@GaryGensler</a>’s SEC continues its losing streak in the courts.</p>
<p>A judge has ruled against the SEC in the DEBT Box case—imposing sanctions on the Commission for acting in bad faith.</p>
<p>This is one of the most alarming examples yet of Gensler’s abuse of power.</p>
<p>— Financial Services GOP (@FinancialCmte) <a href="https://twitter.com/FinancialCmte/status/1769855183352193081?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">March 18, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>The SEC initially admitted to mistakes and apologized for the &#8220;shortfall&#8221; in the case. However, they maintained their lawyers had not acted in bad faith and requested the judge waive sanctions.</p>
<p>This attempt at damage control proved futile. In a recent 80-page ruling, Judge Shelby not only sanctioned the SEC by requiring them to cover Debt Box&#8217;s legal fees related to the TRO, but also denied their motion to dismiss the lawsuit without prejudice.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/1u6hadqR/" width="2475" /></p>

<p>This decision has significant implications. Firstly, it&#8217;s a major victory for the crypto exchange and a blow to the SEC&#8217;s enforcement record under Chair Gary Gensler.</p>
<p>Critics, including a group of Republican senators, have long expressed concern about the agency&#8217;s zealous approach to regulating the crypto sector. This case provides concrete evidence that the SEC&#8217;s methods might be overly aggressive.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Federal Court Imposes Sanctions on SEC for Misconduct in Debt Box Lawsuit</p>
<p>In a significant turn of events, the United States District Court has imposed sanctions on the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for what has been described as a &#8220;gross abuse of power&#8221; in its…</p>

<p></p>
<p>Secondly, the ruling raises serious questions about the SEC&#8217;s use of TROs. Judge Shelby&#8217;s criticism highlights a potential for abuse.</p>
<h2><strong>DEBT Box Fallout Sends Ripple Effects Across Crypto Industry</strong></h2>
<p>The fallout extends beyond Debt Box. Leading crypto companies like Coinbase, currently embroiled in their own legal battles with the SEC, are watching closely.</p>
<p>This decision could embolden them to challenge the SEC&#8217;s tactics more aggressively. More broadly, it may lead to increased scrutiny of Gensler&#8217;s regulatory approach.</p>
<p>Coinbase Chief Legal Officer Paul Grewal tweeted:</p>
<blockquote>
&#8220;The Commission just foisted a bill onto every one of us for their litigation misconduct,&#8221; reflecting the industry&#8217;s concern and frustration.
</blockquote>
<p>However, it&#8217;s crucial to note that the judge&#8217;s ruling doesn&#8217;t rule on the firm&#8217;s guilt or innocence regarding the alleged fraud. The lawsuit will continue. Furthermore, the impact on other ongoing SEC cases against crypto firms remains to be seen.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Whale Abruptly Moves 16,003 BTC After 5+ Years Silence</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/1-5-billion-bitcoin-leaves-coinbase-bullish-signal/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/1-5-billion-bitcoin-leaves-coinbase-bullish-signal/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。一只比特币鲸鱼突然在网络上转移了约16,003 BTC，这些比特币在休眠了五年以上后才动用。交易数据表明这笔交易涉及到一些非常古老的硬币。交易涉及的地址从5年到7年闭塞的比特币数量很大，价值约10.8亿美元。分析师发现这次交易与Coinbase有关，可能是资金的输出。这一举动可能预示着一个大型实体可能正在进行一些新的买入，并将硬币移至可能的自管式存储。最新的比特币价格在67,000美元左右交易。 <div>
<p>On-chain data shows a Bitcoin whale has suddenly moved around 16,003 BTC on the chain after staying dormant for more than five years.</p>
<h2>A Large Amount Of Dormant Bitcoin Has Just Moved On The Network</h2>
<p>As CryptoQuant community manager Maartunn pointed out in a <a href="https://twitter.com/JA_Maartun/status/1769443343237283932" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, the Bitcoin blockchain has recently processed a transaction involving some very old coins.</p>
<p>The indicator of interest here is the &#8220;<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-giant-awakens-whale-1000-btc-years-slumber/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Spent Output Age Bands</a>&#8221; (SOAB), which keeps track of the total amount of Bitcoin the different age bands in the market are now transferring on the network.</p>

<p>The age bands here refer to groups of coins divided based on holding time. The 1 day to 1 week age band, for example, includes all tokens that have been dormant for at least a day and at most a week.</p>
<p>In the context of the current discussion, the 5-year to 7-year age band is relevant. Below is the chart showing the SOAB data for this particular cohort.</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin SOAB" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="2580" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GI5TN0lW4AAInKx?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096" width="4096" /></p>

<p>It would appear that 16,003 BTC belonging to this age range have just been moved on the network. This stack would be worth around $1.08 billion at the current exchange rate.</p>
<p>Given the massive scale of the transfer, it&#8217;s likely that a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-soars-past-67000-as-whale-population-grows/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">whale</a> entity is involved here. As for why this investor has decided to break their long silence, it can be complicated.</p>
<p>Maartunn has done some additional sleuthing to find out more about the transfer. It would seem that the profit-to-loss ratio of this transfer was 15, which is quite the amount.</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Whale Profit" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="2580" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GI5TyM-W0AAZXP3?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096" width="4096" /></p>

<p>As the chart shows, there have been other recent transfers of dormant coins holding a comparable profit ratio, which means that this latest transaction isn&#8217;t exactly unique. However, the scale of the movie certainly makes it stand out more.</p>
<p>The analyst has found that the transaction is related to a Coinbase move. Below is the Bitcoin <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-bullish-exchange-netflow-negative-spike/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">netflow</a> data for the exchange, which provides hints about the direction of this transfer.</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Coinbase Netflow" class="alignnone aligncenter" height="2580" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/GI5Vg3tXoAAJNkM?format=jpg&amp;name=4096x4096" width="4096" /></p>

<p>CryptoQuant&#8217;s netflow metric would suggest that the transaction was an outflow, as the indicator&#8217;s value had turned negative. However, Maartunn isn&#8217;t sure whether it&#8217;s an outflow, saying, &#8220;I need more time to conclude whether this is a real outflow &#8211; eventually ETF related &#8211; or it&#8217;s just an internal flow.&#8221;</p>

<p>If it is indeed an outflow, it could be a bullish sign for Bitcoin, as it suggests a large entity is potentially participating in some fresh buying and then taking the coins off into possible self-custody.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>Bitcoin has gone through some notable drawdown over the past week as its price is now trading around $67,000.</p>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的<br />本周最新的钓鱼诈骗事件导致了近300万美元的损失，钓鱼者冒充知名加密交易者Ansem，窃取了260万美元。钓鱼者在交易者的帖子下发布了总共超过3百万美元的欺诈链接，受害者包括不明身份的用户和知名项目。社交媒体上充斥着冒充重要人物的假账户，试图欺诈加密用户。最近，许多项目在预售中筹集了数百万美元，吸引了许多投资者寻求巨额利润，这导致了更多的钓鱼活动。加密领域的盗窃事件仍然在摇撼着市场，加密用户必须警惕他们点击的链接，并采取足够的安全措施来保护他们的资金。 <div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Another start of the week, another crypto scam alert. This week’s latest phishing scam opened Pandora’s box of scamming tactics after almost $3 million was stolen by an impersonator pretending to be a top crypto trader.</p>

<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto Scams, A Tale As Old As Time</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Whether prices are up or down, scammers are on the lookout for their next <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/new-crypto-heist-alert-hacker-drains-5-6m-from-data-storage-platform-wallet/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">big heist</a>, and this market slowdown was no exception.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Crypto detective ZachXBT informed about the latest scamming attack over the weekend. The investigator shared that an account pretending to be renowned crypto trader Ansem (@blknoiz06 on X) phished over $2.6 million.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">An account impersonating <a href="https://twitter.com/blknoiz06?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">@blknoiz06</a> phished &gt;$2.6M today just by replying to each of his posts taking advantage of the recent meme coin craze. </p>
<p>The largest single victim lost ~$1.2M.</p>

<p>&mdash; ZachXBT (@zachxbt) <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1769150002490638597?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">March 16, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Under the @blfnoiz06 username, the impersonating account replied to the trader’s X posts promoting a presale link that redirected users to a wallet drainer.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The scammer would announce under each post that he was about to &#8220;launch his token&#8221; $BULL, and the presale participants were required to send a minimum of 1 SOL and a maximum of 3 SOL.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Ironically, the scammer replied to one of Ansem’s posts where he stated, “I don’t launch coins bros.” As reported by the crypto detective, the largest victim lost $1.2 million worth of SOL. Hours after the report, an additional $250,000 had been stolen, raising the loot to almost $3 million.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Another ~$250K stolen since my post lol</p>
<p>&mdash; ZachXBT (@zachxbt) <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1769180302860046608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">March 17, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">When questioned whether these were real victims or scammers moving their stolen tokens around, ZachXBT confirmed that several victims, including the largest one, had messaged him to inform him of the scam.</p>
<h2 style="font-weight: 400;">Phishing In Troubled Waters</h2>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Despite not being a new tactic, the number of phishing scams involving popular and influential actors in the crypto community appears to have increased recently.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Scrolling through social media, especially X, means seeing many accounts <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/deepfakes-use-buterins-image-in-sham-crypto-promo/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">pretending</a> to be important figures and trying to catch naive, greedy, or incautious users.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Web3 anti-scam platform Scam Sniffer urged its followers to stay vigilant after detecting several impersonators trying to prey on crypto users.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The array of personalities and projects being taken advantage of goes from virtual artists to L2 NFT-focused blockchains to liquid re-staking protocols, as reported by the anti-scam platform.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Scammers appear to be trying to take advantage of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-meme-shiba-inu-dogecoin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">memecoin frenzy</a> that’s taking place. Recently, many projects have raised millions in presales, and many investors are looking for their next big profit. As a result, phishing in troubled waters becomes an easy task.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">As seen in the dramatic launch of the Solana-based memecoin Slerf, impersonators tried to take advantage of the situation. They created an account pretending to represent the team behind the project.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">This launch saw the accidental burn of the Liquidity pool (LP) and Presale airdrop SLERF tokens, which resulted in the loss of over $10 million raised by presale participants.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><img alt="crypto scam, solana, bitcoin, slerf" class="size-large wp-image-288048 aligncenter" height="658" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Captura-de-Pantalla-2024-03-18-a-las-11.50.02-a.-m.jpg?w=601&#038;resize=601%2C658" width="601" /></p>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Responding to the real account, the impersonator claimed the mistake was “a joke” and provided a fraudulent link for presale investors to “claim” their tokens.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">These tactics have made many affected figures limit the people who can reply to their posts and issue warnings about the scam. Similarly, others have <a href="https://twitter.com/Slerfsol/status/1769621998068535694" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">chosen</a> to end their posts with an image disclosing that any other information or link below doesn’t come from them.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It’s worth noting that crypto heists continue to shake the crypto space, with <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-hacks-value-saw-97-in-february-investigator/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">millions lost</a>. Due to this, crypto users must be wary of the links they engage with and ensure they have taken enough security measures to safeguard their funds.</p>

<title>Binance Investigates 300M BOME Token Pre-Listing Purchase In Insider Trading Scandal</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/binance-investigates-300m-bome-token-pre-listing/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/binance-investigates-300m-bome-token-pre-listing/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的<br />加密货币交易所币安对Solana Book Of Meme（BOME）上市涉及内幕交易的指控进行了调查。BOME的市值从零迅速上升到超过20亿美元，引发了社区指控内幕交易的讨论。币安迅速回应了指控，启动了内部调查。同时，OKX交易所丰富自身列表的方式与币安不同，强调他们独立做出上市决定。交易所币安的币安币（BNB）在过去24小时下跌4.8％，交易停留在543美元。 <div>
<p>Crypto exchange Binance has investigated allegations of insider trading concerning the listing of Solana <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-implements-stricter-token-listing-procedure/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">meme coin</a> Book Of Meme (BOME). </p>
<h2>Binance Investigates Insider Trading Claims</h2>
<p>On March 14th, Pepe Meme artist Darkfarms introduced the Solana meme coin BOME. He initiated the token&#8217;s presale by sharing a Solana address on Twitter, where raised SOL funds were utilized to add <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/nigeria-crackdown-binance-authorities-demand/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">liquidity</a>. </p>
<p>Within three days, BOME <a href="https://wublock.substack.com/p/talk-with-bome-investor-flynngao?r=jbpop&amp;triedRedirect=true" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">skyrocketed </a>from zero to a peak market value of over $2 billion (currently valued at $700 million) and secured a listing on the Binance exchange. </p>
<p>However, before the listing of the meme coin, a whale &#8211; a person or entity that holds a large amount of crypto &#8211; <a href="https://twitter.com/ChainROI/status/1769045094458331525" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">purchased </a>314 million BOME tokens for $2.3 million on the Raydium decentralized exchange (DEX) on March 15, at an average price of $0.0074 per token. </p>
<p>After the listing, the token&#8217;s value skyrocketed to $0.026, making the purchased tokens worth approximately $5 million. This suspicious transaction triggered community discussions, with some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/1bguk21/comment/kv9v4dt/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">speculating </a>about the possibility of insider trading. </p>

<p>Binance promptly responded to the allegations by launching an internal investigation into the insider trading claims linked to BOME&#8217;s listing on their exchange. </p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/binancezh/status/1769596302323798256?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">statement</a>, Binance addressed the community&#8217;s concerns, stating that it takes such information seriously and is committed to conducting a thorough investigation. The exchange&#8217;s preliminary findings indicate that the individual named in the allegations has no connection to Binance.</p>
<p>Moreover, Binance expressed gratitude for the community&#8217;s vigilance and emphasized the importance of transparency and fairness. The exchange promised to continue investigating the matter in-depth to uncover the truth surrounding the allegations. </p>
<p>To encourage reporting any instances of currency quotation corruption or insider misconduct involving Binance team members, the exchange offered <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/changpeng-zhao-ordered-to-surrender-passport/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">financial rewards</a> ranging from $100,000 to $5 million while ensuring the confidentiality of the whistleblower&#8217;s identity.</p>
<p>According to CoinGecko <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/book-of-meme" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">data</a>, the BOME token currently trades at $0.01114, marking a significant 51% decline from its listing price and all-time high (ATH) of $0.02689. Additionally, the trading volume has decreased by 35%.</p>
<h2>OKX Founder Responds To Speculations</h2>
<p>In contrast to Binance, the second-largest offshore exchange, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/okx-approved-a-win-for-singapores-crypto-ambitions/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">OKX</a>, has not listed any recent Solana meme coins. The founder of OKX, StarXu, has responded to speculations regarding this matter. </p>
<p>StarXu <a href="https://x.com/star_okx/status/1769733521793536340?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">clarified </a>that the OKX listing team&#8217;s primary focus is to discover valuable and promising utility tokens for their customers at an early stage. Unlike some exchanges, OKX does not entertain requests or pitches for listings. </p>
<p>Instead, the founder of OKX stated that they thoroughly researched potential projects in the market and closely monitored the performance of the tokens over a long period. Final listing decisions are made independently by OKX&#8217;s <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/okx-probe-south-korea-alleged-crypto-violations/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Listing Committee</a>.</p>

<p>StarXu emphasized that repeatedly promoting or pushing tokens to OKX team members on Twitter will not influence the listing process in any way. He urged individuals to refrain from such activities and stated that they have no influence on the selection of tokens for listing on the OKX exchange.</p>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。知名加密货币分析师Willy Woo对比特币的未来进行了深入分析，提出了对该资产与黄金和美元这样的传统资产进行投资的可行性。他对BTC投资的风险/回报比进行了研究，并表示比特币有望明显超过黄金。其分析提出了三种可能的估值情景：实现“超级比特币化”、与美元相匹配以及超越黄金。同时，BTC市场正面临美联储等宏观因素的影响，尤其是即将宣布的联邦公开市场委员会（FOMC）会议，可能对比特币价格产生显著影响。总体而言，尽管最近出现了差距，比特币仍然表现出韧性，维持在66000美元以上的水平。 <div>
<p>Renowned crypto analyst Willy Woo has recently <a href="https://x.com/woonomic/status/1769535005384912931?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">delved</a> into the future of Bitcoin, providing an analysis that explores the asset&#8217;s investment viability against traditional assets like gold and the US dollar.</p>
<p>With over a decade of experience in the market, Woo&#8217;s insights offer a dive into the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-shake-up-galaxy-ceo-novogratz-warns-btc/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">possibilities</a> for the world&#8217;s largest cryptocurrency.</p>

<h2>Exploring Bitcoin&#8217;s Potential Valuations</h2>
<p>Examining the risk/reward ratio of BTC investment, Woo presents an optimistic outlook, suggesting that Bitcoin holds a significant chance of outperforming gold.</p>
<p>His analysis outlines three scenarios for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-coinbase-premium-deep-red-reason-crash/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin&#8217;s future valuation</a>: achieving &#8220;hyperbitcoinization&#8221; with a coin value of $4.8 million, matching the US dollar at $1 million per BTC, and surpassing gold with a valuation of $690,000 per coin.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Today that bet is:</p>
<p>$4.8m &#8211; hyperbitcoinisation
$1m &#8211; matches USD size
$690k &#8211; displaces gold</p>
<p>The payoff is 10x &#8211; 70x, now make your own guess at chances of success and bet accordingly.</p>
<p>— Willy Woo (@woonomic) <a href="https://twitter.com/woonomic/status/1769535009080148183?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">March 18, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Woo&#8217;s forecasts suggest that the prospect of earning returns ranging from 1,000% to 7,000% draws the interest of those looking for advice on investing in BTC. However, he cautions investors to judge the potential success of cryptocurrencies and tailor their investment approaches as needed. Specifically, Woo noted</p>
<blockquote><p>For example if you think there’s more than 10% chance of BTC superceding gold, then it’s probably worth investing to get the 10x.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Macro Influences And Bitcoin&#8217;s Current State</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, the cryptocurrency market, especially BTC, is on the verge of finding itself at the mercy of broader <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/jim-bianco-backs-vanguard-on-bitcoin-etfs-decision/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">economic decisions</a>, such as the upcoming announcement by the US Federal Reserve.</p>
<p>Prominent Chinese crypto journalist Colin Wu highlights the anticipation of the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, which could significantly influence Bitcoin&#8217;s price movements.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The Federal Reserve FOMC will announce its interest rate decision on March 20 this week, and Chairman Powell will give a speech. Currently, CME shows that the probability of keeping interest rates unchanged is as high as 99%. In addition, Switzerland, Australia, the United…</p>
<p>— Wu Blockchain (@WuBlockchain) <a href="https://twitter.com/WuBlockchain/status/1769543035619250407?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">March 18, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>With expectations set on the Fed potentially maintaining interest rates, the decision could have far-reaching implications for BTC and the wider crypto market.</p>
<img alt="Bitcoin (BTC) price chart on TradingView" class="size-medium" height="1556" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/Eg8uvmHo/" width="2770" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite recent pullbacks that saw Bitcoin&#8217;s price decrease by nearly 10% over the past week, the cryptocurrency has shown resilience, maintaining its position above the $66,000 mark.</p>

<p>This recent dip, amid anticipation of the FOMC meeting and the upcoming BTC halving, illustrates the complex interplay between macroeconomic factors and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-hashrate-plunges-from-all-time-high-but-why/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">cryptocurrency valuations</a>.</p>

<title>Binance CEO Predicts Bitcoin Surging Beyond $80,000 Driven By ETF Inflows</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-surging-beyond-80000-driven-by-etf-inflows/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-surging-beyond-80000-driven-by-etf-inflows/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章首先介绍了比特币在过去5天内的波动情况，包括价格从历史最高点跌至更低水平，然后回升至68000美元以上。文章引用了Binance首席执行官Richard Teng的观点，表示比特币的价格将超过80000美元，归因于机构投资的增加。文章还提到了数字资产的大量流入，创下历史纪录，全球交易量达430亿美元，美国市场引领资金流入。总体来说，文章表明比特币和数字资产继续受到增长和投资者关注的推动。 <div>
<p>Over the past five days, Bitcoin (BTC), the leading cryptocurrency, has experienced a period of heightened volatility, triggering significant liquidations of leveraged positions as its price fluctuated wildly in hours. </p>
<p>After reaching an all-time high of $73,750 on Thursday, BTC experienced a<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-a-decades-long-investment-ceo-says-despite-recent-downturn/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> sharp decline </a>to $64,600 on Sunday. On Monday, at the start of the trading week, the cryptocurrency recaptured the $68,000 level. Nonetheless, it retraced over 2% shortly after, settling around the $66,800 mark.</p>
<p>Amidst this turbulent market activity, Binance Chief Executive Officer Richard Teng, as <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-17/binance-ceo-teng-sees-bitcoin-topping-80-000-on-etf-inflows" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reported </a>by Bloomberg, believes that Bitcoin&#8217;s record-breaking rally will persist, propelling its price beyond $80,000. </p>
<h2>Binance CEO Bullish On Bitcoin</h2>
<p>Teng attributes this expected surge to the increasing influx of institutional investment into the newly approved spot Bitcoin <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/jim-bianco-backs-vanguard-on-bitcoin-etfs-decision/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">exchange-traded funds</a> (ETFs), trading for just over two months. The introduction of Bitcoin ETFs in the United States earlier this year has attracted significant attention from institutional investors, resulting in new inflows.</p>

<p>Speaking at an event in Bangkok on Sunday, Teng stated that he originally estimated Bitcoin to hover around $80,000 by the end of the year. However, he now envisions the cryptocurrency surpassing that milestone due to reduced supply and sustained demand. </p>
<p>Teng emphasized that his forecast represents his viewpoint and acknowledged that the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-defi-tvl-rockets-80-impact-on-sol-price/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">rally </a>will not be linear. He believes the market&#8217;s ups and downs will ultimately benefit the entire ecosystem.</p>
<p>Lastly, Teng highlighted the continued inflow of funds into US spot Bitcoin ETFs since their approval in January. He expects more institutions and family offices to increase their allocations to Bitcoin ETFs shortly.</p>
<p>Richard Teng assumed the CEO role after Binance co-founder Changpeng Zhao (CZ) stepped down in November following Binance&#8217;s <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-ceo-to-step-down-4-billion-settlement/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">$4.3 billion settlement</a> with US authorities. </p>
<h2>Digital Asset Inflows Skyrocket </h2>
<p>In a recent blog <a href="https://blog.coinshares.com/volume-174-digital-asset-fund-flows-weekly-report-60801e380967" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, digital asset investment company CoinShares announced that digital asset investment products experienced a record weekly inflow, reaching $2.9 billion last week. </p>
<p>This surpasses the all-time high of $2.7 billion set the previous week. Furthermore, these inflows bring the year-to-date (YTD) total to an impressive $13.2 billion, surpassing the total inflows for all of 2021, which were $10.6 billion.</p>
<img alt="Bitcoin " class="size-large wp-image-288038" height="660" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Screenshot_79.jpg?w=669&#038;resize=669%2C660" width="669" />
<p>Trading volumes for the week amounted to $43 billion, matching the previous week&#8217;s record and accounting for 47% of the overall global Bitcoin volumes. </p>
<p>During this period, global exchange-traded products (ETPs) crossed the milestone of $100 billion for the first time. However, due to the<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/vanguard-ceo-double-down-on-anti-bitcoin-etf-stance/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> price correction</a> towards the end of the week, the total settled at $97 billion.</p>

<p>Regionally, the United States witnessed substantial inflows of $2.95 billion, while minor inflows were observed in Australia, Brazil, and Hong Kong, amounting to $5 million, $24 million, and $15 million, respectively. </p>
<p>Conversely, Canada, Germany, Sweden, and Switzerland experienced combined outflows of $78 million during the same week. On the other hand, the year has seen outflows of $685 million thus far.</p>
<p>Bitcoin dominated the inflows last week, securing $2.86 billion and accounting for 97% of all inflows year-to-date. Interestingly, short Bitcoin positions witnessed their largest inflows in a year, totaling $26 million, marking the fifth consecutive week of increased interest in this area.</p>

<p>She shared a screenshot outlining five essential aspects of meme coin investing, compiled by <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-team-1-2-million-burned/">Shiba Inu team member Da Vinci</a>. The first step of the guide highlighted the necessity of understanding the risks and high volatility characteristic of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/meme-coin-madness-sends-ethereum-fees-soaring/">meme coin market</a>, accentuating how these coins frequently undergo <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/can-doge-avoid-a-dive-sell-pressure-puts-memecoin-to-the-test/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">swift price fluctuations. </a></p>
<p>Lucie further disclosed how much meme coins were subservient to social media. According to the SHIB influencer, the price of meme coins is greatly influenced by intangible factors like <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/digitoads-races-towards-5-million-milestone-without-dogecoin-style-elon-musk-celebrity-endorsements/">celebrity endorsement</a> and social media trends. This highlights the possible absence of an intrinsic value in these coins, amplifying the potential for increased risks. </p>
<p>In stressing the dangers associated with <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/solanas-biggest-memecoin-gains-681000-in-3-days-as-more-investors-bet-on-its-popularity/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">meme coin investments</a>, the Shiba Inu team has also provided important advice to investors looking into this market. They urge crypto enthusiasts to thoroughly understand the fundamental principles of a meme coin, along with its community dynamics and market trends, before making any investment decisions.</p>
<p>Further highlighting the need for risk mitigation, the team has stated the necessity of utilizing only expendable funds for <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/top-meme-coin-to-surge-100x-post-bitcoin-halving/">meme coin</a> investments. They stressed the importance of responsible investing, urging investors to base their decisions on solid research rather than market hype. By adhering to these <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/guide-for-crypto-investors-7-memecoins-that-could-outperform-shiba-inu-in-2024/">guides</a>, investors may potentially avoid unnecessary risks in the market, while also optimizing their <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/3-meme-coins-you-should-have-in-your-portfolio-for-the-bull-run/">investment strategies</a>. </p>
<h2>Shiba Inu: More Than Just A Meme?</h2>
<p>Starting as a humorous project developed by an anonymous individual or group identified as “Ryoshi”, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-google-ai-price-shib/">SHIB</a> began its journey as a meme coin, distinguished by its speculative nature and comedic mascot inspired by the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/who-moved-1-trillion-shiba-inu-tokens-huge-transfer-raises-eyebrows/">Shiba Inu</a> dog breed. However, over the years, the cryptocurrency has been making serious efforts toward differentiating itself from others, adopting a unique three-token structure, cultivating a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bone-binance-shiba-inu-army-campaigns-for-listing/">vibrant community</a> and showcasing its versatile use cases.</p>

<p>In light of these developments, Lucie has <a href="https://x.com/lucieshib/status/1769577485123936423?s=46" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">boldly declared</a> in a recent X post, that SHIB has finally transcended the meme coin label. The Shiba Inu marketing influencer pointed out that the cryptocurrency has secured a position among the top 11 altcoins in the space, underscoring the token’s <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shibarium-new-record/">growing popularity</a> and possibly <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-price-0-0001-target/">promising trajectory</a>. </p>
<p>She has also expressed optimism concerning SHIB’s ability to evolve into a <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/company/are-governance-tokens-the-future-of-defi/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">governance token</a>, potentially granting holders the opportunity to participate and vote on the decision-making processes of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-founder-end-vision/">Shiba Inu ecosystem.</a></p>

<title>FTX Bankruptcy Trade Turns Into Legal Showdown As Profits Soar By 200%</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-bankruptcy-trade-turns-into-legal-showdown/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-bankruptcy-trade-turns-into-legal-showdown/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> 摘要：<br /><br />这些信息是积极的。伦敦的破产资产交易公司Attestor Ltd.从FTX加密交易所购买的加密资产价值暴涨，获得了巨大的利润。然而，Attestor购买的FTX账户的卖家Lemma Technologies选择保留索赔，引发法律纠纷。Lemma的主要投资者Bang面临盗用数字资产的指控。此外，涉及Haru Invest的另一案件也牵涉到Bang。这些法律纠纷的解决将影响各方的未来。 <div>
<p>London-based boutique distressed asset trading firm Attestor Ltd. experienced a significant bonanza as the value of crypto assets purchased from <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftxs-sam-bankman-fried-should-receive-50-year-jail/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Sam Bankman-Fried&#8217;s</a> FTX crypto exchange soared. </p>
<p>According to a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-18/london-fund-s-ftx-bankruptcy-windfall-mired-in-legal-battle" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, Attestor&#8217;s trade became the talk of distressed investing circles as profits multiplied at an astonishing rate &#8211; 50%, 100%, and even close to 200%.</p>
<h2>Multi-Million-Dollar Gain From FTX Bankruptcy Threatened</h2>
<p>As the value of crypto assets rose sharply, Attestor and other market participants reportedly seized the opportunity to purchase distressed assets at “rock-bottom prices” from Bankman-Fried&#8217;s clients seeking to recover their losses. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-drops-bombshell-lawsuit/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">bankruptcy proceedings</a> of FTX, Bankman-Fried&#8217;s cryptocurrency exchange, are projected to deliver investors the full amount of their frozen funds, estimated at 100% of the initial investment.</p>
<p>However, Attestor&#8217;s hold on its share of the windfall has become uncertain. The seller of one of the largest FTX accounts purchased by Attestor, an allegedly &#8220;obscure&#8221; Panamanian company called Lemma Technologies, controlled by a South Korean trader, has opted to keep the claim to itself, at least for now.</p>

<p>Attestor&#8217;s legal team argues in a New York court that this situation demonstrates &#8220;seller&#8217;s remorse.&#8221; The price <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/blockfi-resolves-dispute-with-ftx-alameda-research/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">agreed upon with Lemma in June 2023</a> was $58 million, but the claim&#8217;s current value is expected to reach $165 million. </p>
<p>Lemma, the Panamanian firm, has yet to publicly explain its position or respond to Attestor&#8217;s lawsuit in New York. Attestor&#8217;s attorneys assert that Lemma will only honor the trade confirmations if compelled to do so by the force of law.</p>
<p>Adding to the intrigue is that Lemma&#8217;s main investor, Junho Bang, is facing legal charges in a separate case in Seoul, South Korea. </p>
<h2>Embezzlement Charges</h2>
<p>Attestor agreed with Lemma in June to purchase a bundle of FTX claims, believed to be among the largest. With this year&#8217;s <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/incarcerated-sam-bankman-fried-promote-solana/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">cryptocurrency recovery </a>and successful asset recovery efforts, these claims are now set to pay out in full. </p>
<p>The attestor is reportedly eager to close the deal and is willing to &#8220;complete the transactions immediately.&#8221; However, Lemma&#8217;s Junho Bang appears to be in no hurry to do so, possibly due to his involvement in the separate crypto-lender Haru Invest case, according to Bloomberg.</p>
<p>Bang stands accused of “embezzling” digital assets from the lender and is currently facing charges by South Korean authorities. Although the Haru Invest case and the Attestor&#8217;s lawsuit over FTX claims are distinct, Bang is central to both matters.</p>

<p>During the cryptocurrency boom, Haru Invest allegedly offered “high returns,” but it eventually froze<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-founder-sam-bankman-fried-in-the-spotlight/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> customer redemptions</a>, citing issues with its service provider, B&amp;S Holdings, which allegedly provided false information. B&amp;S described itself as a quantitative trading company for crypto assets, including FTX&#8217;s FTT token.</p>
<p>As the legal proceedings continue, the resolution of these cases will shape the outcomes for the involved parties and shed light on the future dynamics of distressed investing in the crypto space.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Analyst Targets $500,000 But Warns of “Scary” Dips</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-targets-500000-scary-dips/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-targets-500000-scary-dips/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。一位加密分析师认为，到2025年中旬，比特币将达到50万美元。尽管价格走势上涨，但分析师预计会出现一些“可怕”的跌幅。尽管比特币价格在周末出现震荡，但分析师建议投资者保持信心，认为比特币价格会随着时间推移上涨。此外，比特币ETF的需求不断增加，预计价格将因激增的需求而上涨。不过，分析师警告投资者在未来可能面临惊人的价格波动，但应保持冷静。比特币价格仍然看涨，尤其是在比特币减半奖励之前。 <div>
<p>In a post on X, one crypto analyst thinks Bitcoin will reach $500,000 by mid-2025. However, even as prices trend higher, the rally won&#8217;t be smooth sailing, expecting some &#8220;scary&#8221; dips. </p>
<h2>Bitcoin Is Shaky</h2>
<p>The <a class="editor-rtfLink" href="https://twitter.com/bitcoinmunger/status/1769441980113691023" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">analysis</a> is when Bitcoin prices appear shaky, characterized by sharp corrections. Over the weekend, prices plunged lower, denting confidence after a weak conclusion on Friday. Prices are yet to recover, trending below the psychological $70,000 level.</p>
<img alt="Bitcoin on track to $500,000 | Source: Analyst on X" class="size-full wp-image-287989" height="690" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GI5RmqaX0AAP8Ro.jpg?resize=1024%2C690" width="1024" />
<p>Even amid this, the analyst says people should hold on tightly, relaying confidence that the only way for the world&#8217;s most valuable coin is up. To support this outlook, the analyst compares Bitcoin&#8217;s price action and the historical trajectory of gold following the launch of Gold exchange-traded funds (ETF). </p>
<p>At current rates, and despite the lull over the weekend, Bitcoin is outpacing gold&#8217;s historical growth pattern. This preview suggests that, like gold, Bitcoin could rally over time. From this projection, the analyst thinks not only will bulls shake off the current weakness but see prices rally nearly 7X from current rates to $500,000, following a similar path to gold&#8217;s trajectory.</p>

<p>Still, while the $500,000 target is undoubtedly enticing, the analyst warns investors to brace themselves for &#8220;scary falls&#8221; along the way. These dips, the analyst emphasizes, shouldn&#8217;t be misconstrued as signs of the end. Instead, they should be seen as a natural part of Bitcoin&#8217;s historical price action.</p>
<a href="https://www.tradingview.com/x/BfxVsiD9/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="Bitcoin price trending upward on the daily chart | Source: BTCUSDT on Binance, TradingView" class="size-full" height="904" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/BfxVsiD9/" width="1787" /></a>
<p>Despite the expected volatility, the analyst urges investors to &#8220;stay calm&#8221; now and in the future in the face of anticipated price drops. After sharp expansions over the past few trading weeks, there could be suggestions that the coin has peaked, and prices are likely to correct in the cool-off. </p>
<h2>Demand From Spot ETFs Ahead Of Halving</h2>
<p>Although it may be accurate, the rate at which Bitcoin ETF issuers purchase BTC for their clients is positive for the market. In a post on X, an analyst observes that the amount of spot Bitcoin ETF inflows within a month is comparable to a year of Gold ETF inflows. </p>
<p>This analysis suggests that the demand for BTC is way higher. Accordingly, prices may respond by rallying in the face of surging demand.</p>

<p>Bitcoin remains bullish, less than a month before the protocol halves <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-price-correct-after-halving/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">miner</a> rewards. Supporters are adamant that in the next epoch, considering the current level of demand, there will be a supply crisis. In that case, BTC prices might remain high.</p>

<title>US Treasury Approved Exchange Announces XRP Listing</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/us-treasury-exchange-xrp/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/us-treasury-exchange-xrp/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的<br />法官Analisa Torres判定XRP不属于证券后，XRP价格有望继续上涨。美国财政部批准的交易所Atlantis Exchange宣布将上市XRP。该交易所对XRP的快速跨境交易能力表示赞赏，并预测其价格可能会增长100倍。此外，XRP目前价格为$0.611，市值为$33.48亿，位列第6。交易所开放了XRP的存款和交易，但暂未集成原生区块链。 <div>
<p class="p2">The XRP price could be headed for greater heights with the latest development coming out of the community. While <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-scores-win-endorsed-as-non-security-status/">the altcoin</a> has been trading on leading crypto exchanges since Judge Analisa Torres’s rules that programmatic sales did not qualify as securities sale, it has moved a step forward with an announcement from an exchange approved by the United States Treasury Department.</p>
<h2 class="p2">XRP Debuts On US Treasury-Approved Exchange</h2>
<p class="p2">On Saturday, March 16, Atlantis Exchange <a href="https://x.com/Atlantis_Ex/status/1769207654365196413?s=20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> that it would be listing XRP for trading. This listing is significant to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ripple-ceo-success-for-xrp/">the altcoin</a> because Atlantis Exchange is one of the few exchanges for trading cryptocurrencies that have been registered with not only the United States Treasury, but also the United Nations.</p>

<p class="p2">This listing puts XRP among around 50 cryptocurrencies which are currently trading on the platform. Deposits for users were opened on March 13, and trading on the platform officially began on Monday, March 17. Trading is also expecting to carry on for three days before users will be able to withdraw <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-analyst-bullish-on-ethereum-and-xrp/">XRP tokens</a> from the exchange, which will open on March 20.</p>
<p class="p2">Additionally, the network for depositing XRP to the crypto exchange is the BSC network. This means that users who want to send tokens to Atlantis need to make sure that they are actually using the BSC network to transfer the tokens. Otherwise, they could end up losing their coins. The crypto exchange is yet to integrate the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-advocate-goes-big-500000-pledged-for-senate-campaign-vs-us-senator/">XRP Ledger</a> on the platform, which means transactions cannot be carried out to and from the exchange using the native blockchain.</p>
<h2 class="p2">Nothing But Praise</h2>
<p class="p2">In the posts announcing the listing of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-price-to-hit-3-4-crypto-expert-reveals-when/">XRP token</a>, Atlantis Exchange also took time out to praise the cryptocurrency. The exchange outlines the fact that the token is used for cross-border transactions, highlighting its ability to confirm transactions in 3-5 seconds.</p>

<p class="p2">The exchange also sees a bright future for the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-etf-is-around-the-corner-uphold-research-chief/">XRP price</a>. In its post announcing the listing of XRP for trading, Atlantis Exchange predicted that <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/xrp-price-to-hit-3-4-crypto-expert-reveals-when/">the altcoin’s price</a> could rise another 100x. Now, the feasibility of this is questionable, but it does show that Atlantis does believe that the altcoin will do well going forward.</p>
<p class="p2">As for the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-analyst-bullish-on-ethereum-and-xrp/">token&#8217;s price</a>, it is seeing a slow start to the week with light gains of 0.42% over the last day. However, its current trading value of $0.611 means that the coin is down 2.54% in the last week. Nevertheless, it remains the 6th-largest cryptocurrency in the space with a market cap of $33.48 billion.</p>

<title>Why Bitcoin Halving Could Bring Uncertainty To Mining Industry: An In-Depth Analysis</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/why-bitcoin-halving-could-bring-uncertainty-to-mining-industry/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/why-bitcoin-halving-could-bring-uncertainty-to-mining-industry/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要: 这些信息是积极的。文章讨论了即将到来的比特币减半事件对矿工收入和网络安全的影响。减半将导致收入减少50%，可能使一些操作不盈利。然而，价格上涨和交易费增加可能抵消收入减少，维持挖矿动力。此外，减少供应和增加需求可能有助于挖矿行业的发展。在挖矿技术创新和清洁能源的进一步利用下，操作成本可能会降低，环境可持续性可能会得到改善。最后，金融产品和机构投资能够稳定市场。 <div>
<p>As the countdown to the fourth Bitcoin halving approaches, scheduled around April 19th, 2024, miners are bracing for significant changes in their operations. The halving, which occurs approximately every four years, marks a pivotal event in Bitcoin&#8217;s economic landscape, impacting both miners&#8217; revenues and the network&#8217;s security.</p>
<p>Currently, miners receive 6.25 bitcoins as a reward for each validated block. However, with the upcoming halving, this reward will be slashed by half, dropping to 3.125 bitcoins per block. This abrupt reduction in revenue poses challenges for miners, particularly those operating on narrow profit margins.</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.bitfinex.com/announcements/anatomy-of-the-halving-part-2-block-reward-and-network-security-navigating-the-new-economic-landscape/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">According to a report by cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex,</a> The halving&#8217;s immediate effect is a 50% decline in miners&#8217; income, which could render some operations unprofitable unless mitigated by an equivalent rise in Bitcoin&#8217;s price or reductions in operational costs. The subsequent strain might force less efficient miners out of the market, potentially contracting the network&#8217;s hashing power temporarily.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-287977" height="303" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_00544d.png?resize=542%2C303" width="542" /></p>
<h2><strong>Bitcoin Halving And The Challenge Of Network Security</strong></h2>
<p>Moreover, the reduced block reward raises concerns about Bitcoin&#8217;s network security and the potential for increased centralization of mining power. The network relies on decentralized miners to validate transactions and secure the blockchain.</p>
<blockquote>
“Centralization risks could mean the potential censorship of transactions and increased vulnerability to coordinated attacks or regulatory pressures,” Bitfinex said.
</blockquote>
<p>However, a decrease in rewards, without compensatory factors like increased Bitcoin prices or transaction fees, might disincentivize mining activities among smaller miners, leading to a consolidation of mining power among larger, more resourceful entities. This concentration of power could pose <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-halving-questioned-by-this-expert/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">risks to Bitcoin&#8217;s decentralized nature</a>, potentially enabling censorship of transactions and increasing vulnerability to coordinated attacks or regulatory pressures.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/AoJHf19j/" width="1835" /></p>

<p>Historically, halvings have spurred price rallies in Bitcoin due to increased scarcity. If this trend persists, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-50-drop-possible-ahead-of-halving/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">appreciating value of Bitcoin</a> could counterbalance reduced  block rewards, sustaining miner incentives and bolstering network security. However, this outcome hinges on several factors, including market demand and macroeconomic conditions.</p>
<p>Regulatory scrutiny adds another layer of complexity to the mining industry&#8217;s future. Governments worldwide, including the Biden administration in the US and various EU nations, are eyeing stricter regulations on Bitcoin mining due to environmental concerns.</p>
<h2><strong>Potential Outcomes And Strategies Post-Bitcoin Halving</strong></h2>
<p>The proposed Bitcoin mining energy tax in the US aims to generate substantial revenue, projected at nearly $10 billion in 2025 and over $42 billion in the next decade. If enacted, this tax could reshape the economic landscape for Bitcoin mining in the US, compelling industry players to adopt more energy-efficient technologies or relocate to less regulated jurisdictions.</p>

<p>Despite these challenges, there are potential beneficial outcomes for the mining industry after the bitcoin halving event. A significant<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-to-reach-100k-in-2024/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> price increase in Bitcoin,</a> driven by reduced supply and growing demand, could offset reduced block rewards, maintaining or even increasing mining profitability.</p>
<p>Continued innovation in mining technology, coupled with access to cheaper and cleaner energy sources, could lower operational costs and improve environmental sustainability.</p>
<p>Furthermore, expansion into new regions with abundant renewable energy could diversify industry risks and enhance resilience. Increased transaction fees, driven by higher demand and efficiency improvements, could also supplement miners&#8217; revenue.</p>
<p>Institutional investment and the development of innovative financial products could stabilize the market and further integrate Bitcoin into the global financial system.</p>

<title>Ex-Coinbase CTO Urges ‘Vote for Bitcoin’: Why It Matters</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/ex-coinbase-cto-vote-for-bitcoin/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章中主要要点包括：巴拉吉·斯里尼瓦桑在社交媒体上呼吁支持比特币；将比特币与美元的竞争视为全球意义重大的决定；强调比特币的透明性和抗干预性；对比特币市场的发展和投资前景进行观察；指出比特币对传统金融秩序的冲击；预测比特币引起地缘政治和社会变革可能引发的冲突。文章以比特币目前的交易价格为结尾。 <div>
<p>In a thought-provoking statement on X (formerly Twitter), Balaji Srinivasan, the former Chief Technology Officer (CTO) at Coinbase and a notable figure in the venture capital world through his tenure at Andreessen Horowitz, stirred the crypto community and beyond with a bold proclamation: &#8220;VOTE FOR BITCOIN.&#8221; Srinivasan, leveraging his considerable influence in the tech and crypto spheres, articulated a vision that extends beyond mere investment advice, framing the choice between BTC and the US dollar (USD) as a pivotal global referendum.</p>
<p>He argued, &#8220;The real election is BTC vs USD, the primaries have already started across the world, and every ballot counts. So make sure to vote early and often. [&#8230;] The USD/BTC exchange rate is the one financial indicator that DC can’t fake,&#8221; highlighting the intrinsic transparency and resistance to manipulation Bitcoin offers compared to traditional financial metrics vulnerable to distortion by central authorities like the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/us-crypto-industry-major-victory-federal-reserve/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Federal Reserve</a>.</p>

<p></p>
<h2>Bitcoin Vs. The US-Dollar: The Real Election</h2>
<p>Srinivasan&#8217;s assertion underscores a growing distrust in the mechanisms of traditional financial regulation and the authenticity of Bitcoin. He further emphasized the significance of recent legal and regulatory developments, particularly pointing to the August 29, 2023, ruling in the Grayscale case as a watershed moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Since they can&#8217;t fake the price of Bitcoin, the only thing the tradfi system could do is try to block the exit from dollars to Bitcoin. Which is why the SEC fought against ETF access for ten years. They finally lost on Aug 29, 2023 [&#8230;] this <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/breaking-grayscale-scores-victory-against-us-sec-spot-bitcoin-etf-imminent/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">court decision</a> is important because it opened the floodgates, allowing value to flow towards the Bitcoin ledger — and away from DC&#8217;s control,&#8221; he noted, suggesting the decision&#8217;s potential to catalyze a more widespread migration of value to BTC.</p>
<p>The conversation around Bitcoin&#8217;s resilience against governmental control is a central theme in Srinivasan&#8217;s discourse. He contends that BTC exists on a ledger beyond the federal government&#8217;s reach, making it inherently resistant to &#8220;freeze, seize, inflate, or confiscate&#8221; tactics that can be employed against more conventional assets. This characteristic of Bitcoin, according to Srinivasan, not only protects individual wealth but also signals a broader shift in how value is stored and exchanged.</p>
<p>Srinivasan&#8217;s insights extend to the investment landscape, where he claims, &#8220;Bitcoin&#8217;s incentives were strong enough to recruit not just <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-private-bitcoin-event/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">BlackRock</a>, but Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, and a critical mass of major firms.&#8221; This comment speaks to the BTC&#8217;s performance and its emerging role as a necessary component of diversified investment portfolios. He provocatively suggests that absence from the Bitcoin market might soon be seen as a strategic misstep, indicating the growing mainstream acceptance of cryptocurrencies as legitimate assets.</p>

<p>Addressing the broader implications of BTC&#8217;s ascendancy, Srinivasan paints a vivid picture of a shifting economic order. &#8220;Its vertical rise signals that something is wrong in the legacy economy [&#8230;] telling you that the smart money no longer has full faith and confidence in fiat,&#8221; he asserts. This observation not only critiques the current state of traditional finance but also posits Bitcoin as a beacon of market sentiment, indicating broader economic trends and concerns.</p>
<p>Perhaps most compellingly, Srinivasan delves into the geopolitical and social dimensions of BGC&#8217;s rise. He foresees potential conflict as traditional power structures react to the decentralizing force of Bitcoin. &#8220;Just visualize&#8230;BLM/antifa/Hamas mobs&#8230;except this time with the support of blue-controlled police and military,&#8221; he speculates, drawing parallels between historical crackdowns on dissent and what he perceives as the inevitable backlash against Bitcoin&#8217;s disruption of established financial and political norms.</p>
<p>In concluding his thorough exposition, Srinivasan encapsulates the essence of his argument: &#8220;So: that&#8217;s why BTC vs USD is the real election.&#8221; This statement elevates the discourse surrounding BTC from technical and financial considerations to a philosophical and political declaration.</p>
<p>For Srinivasan, the choice between Bitcoin and traditional fiat currencies like the USD transcends conventional economic debates, embodying a critical juncture in the evolution of global finance and governance. Through his detailed and evocative commentary, Srinivasan not only champions Bitcoin as a superior asset but also as a symbol of a broader movement towards transparency, autonomy, and resistance against centralized control.</p>
<p>At press time, BTC traded at $67,464.</p>

<title>Is FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried Ditching Prison? Lawyers Reveal Daring Next Steps</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-prison-2/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-prison-2/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。文章揭示了前FTX交易所首席执行官Sam Bankman-Fried为避免监禁制定的计划，包括公开表明自己是共和党人，指责律师，发表强烈的反对币安的言论。检察官要求法院判处SBF 40至50年监禁，表示此处罚将反映出被告行为的严重性。辩护律师则提出将其判处5至6年半监禁，称外界会比监狱更需要他。司法部承认终身监禁对被告来说过于严厉，但也强调不要求法院判处终身监禁。 <div>
<p>A recent <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940.410.3_1.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">court filing</a> revealed plans that the former CEO of the defunct crypto exchange FTX, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-collapse-sam-bankman-fried-trial/">Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF)</a>, had drafted to ensure he avoids jail term. SBF, whose sentencing comes up on March 28, faces the possibility of spending up to 100 years locked behind bars. </p>
<h2>How Bankman-Fried Intended To Avoid Prison</h2>
<p>As part of his plans to avoid a jail term, Sam <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sam-bankman-fried-charges/">Bankman-Fried</a> included going on Tucker Carlson and coming out as a Republican. This formed part of what Sam Bankman-Fried had termed “probably bad ideas” in the Google doc, which contained a long list of things he planned to do to save face. </p>

<p>The FTX founder was publicly known to have made <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/breaking-news-ticker/ftxs-sbf-hit-with-fresh-batch-of-bank-fraud-charges/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">significant political donations</a> to the Democratic party while secretly funneling funds to the GOP. However, from his plan, SBF seemed to have believed that publicly coming out as a Republican would have helped his case more. He also planned to come out against the “woke agenda,” as Republicans are known to be conservatives. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, there were earlier reports that Bankman-Fried would blame all his lawyers as <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-execs/">part of his defense</a>. This was indeed true, as the convicted crypto founder contemplated this, highlighting in the Google doc how he would paint them as incompetent. SBF also planned to make everyone believe that this “cartel of lawyers” was why they failed in running FTX. </p>
<p>Bankman-Fried also thought putting out a “strong anti-Binance message” could help his case. The FTX founder may have indeed carried out this plan, as a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/is-sbf-behind-binance-negative-news/">Bitcoinist report</a> revealed how he might have been responsible for the negative news that gripped the largest crypto exchange last year. </p>
<h2>Prosecutors Ask For 40-50 Years For Sam Bankman-Fried</h2>
<p>As revealed in their <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940.410.0_2.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">sentencing submission</a>, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/us-government-bitcoin-holdings/">Department of Justice (DOJ)</a> has asked the court to sentence SBF to 40 to 50 years in prison, labeling it “necessary.” They noted that such punishment would reflect the seriousness of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ftx-sam-bankman-fried-convicted/">Bankman-Fried’s crimes</a> and protect the public from further crimes of the defendant.  </p>

<p>The defendant’s lawyers had <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/sam-bankman-fried-ftx-fraud/#:~:text=Bankman%2DFried&#039;s%20Lawyers%20Propose%20A,six%20and%20a%20half%20years).">earlier proposed</a> a sentencing limit of 5 years to 6 and a half years, arguing that their client would be more useful in the outside world than in prison. However, the prosecution rebutted this submission and argued that such a sentence would be “woefully inadequate to satisfy the purposes of sentencing.”</p>
<p>Interestingly, the DOJ acknowledged that a life sentence for Sam Bankman-Fried would be “greater than necessary” to satisfy the sentencing guidelines, especially considering the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/prison-ftx-sam-bankman-fried/">defendant’s age</a>. As such, they emphasized that they weren’t asking the court to impose a life sentence. </p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章指出，中国的加密货币投资者在2023年度超越全球其他国家，实现了115亿美元的盈利。尽管中国政府对加密货币活动实施了严格限制，但中国投资者展现出了坚韧不拔的精神。美国在全球市场中占据主导地位，投资者获得94亿美元的收益。此外，亚洲地区继续在加密货币领域发挥重要作用，预示着数字资产类别前景光明。2024年的前几个月显示出了有望实现2021年高峰收益的趋势，尽管中国当局提醒投资者加密货币市场仍具有波动性和监管审查。 <div>
<p>Cryptocurrency investors in China have defied government restrictions to emerge as the<a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/cryptocurrency-gains-by-country-2023/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> fourth-largest earners</a> globally in 2023, according to a report by blockchain research firm Chainalysis.</p>
<p>Despite the government&#8217;s stringent stance on cryptocurrency-related activities, Chinese investors managed to accumulate an impressive $1.15 billion in gains, contributing to a total global crypto earnings of nearly $38 billion.</p>

<p>This resurgence marks a significant recovery from the previous year&#8217;s losses and underscores the enduring interest in virtual assets within China.</p>

<h2><strong>China&#8217;s Crypto Resilience</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3255699/chinas-cryptocurrency-investors-record-gains-more-us1-billion-2023-despite-sweeping-government-ban" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">China&#8217;s performance</a> in the cryptocurrency market stands out given the country&#8217;s strict regulations and bans on cryptocurrency trading and mining.</p>
<p>The success of Chinese crypto enthusiasts highlights a resilient and determined community that continues to find ways to engage in the digital asset space.</p>
<h2><strong>Global Market Trends</strong></h2>
<p>The overall cryptocurrency market experienced a rollercoaster ride in 2023, with earnings remaining steady throughout the year until a dip in August and September.</p>
<p>However, the market quickly rebounded, with November and December witnessing a surge in earnings that surpassed all previous months.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/SFF8tapd/" width="1835" /></p>

<strong>US Dominance And Hong Kong&#8217;s Market</strong>
<p>The United States maintained its dominance in the global cryptocurrency market, with American investors securing an estimated $9.4 billion in gains, far exceeding other countries.</p>
<p>In comparison, investors in the United Kingdom, the second-highest-earning nation, collectively made nearly $1.4 billion.</p>
<p>Hong Kong, a special administrative region of China, also saw a lively cryptocurrency market, with investors securing <a href="https://chinaeconomicreview.com/mainland-china-crypto-investors-made-1bn-in-2023-despite-ban/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">$250 million in gains.</a></p>

<strong>Asia&#8217;s Role And 2024 Outlook</strong>
<p>The continued strength of cryptocurrency adoption, particularly in Asia, signals a promising horizon for the digital asset class.</p>
<p>Despite regulatory challenges and market volatility, the early months of 2024 have shown promising trends that might herald gains comparable to the peak of 2021.</p>
<p>Major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have experienced notable price surges, with BTC even breaking its all-time high price record.</p>

<strong>Regulatory Caution</strong>
<p>Amidst the optimism, Chinese authorities have issued cautionary advice to investors, reminding them of the inherent risks associated with cryptocurrencies.</p>
<p>This serves as a reminder that despite recent successes, the cryptocurrency market remains volatile and subject to regulatory scrutiny.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, BItcoin was <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">trading at $67,590,</a> down 2% and 5% in the daily and weekly timeframes, data by Coingecko shows.</p>

<title>Bitcoin Hashrate Plunges From All-Time High, But Why?</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-hashrate-plunges-from-all-time-high-but-why/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-hashrate-plunges-from-all-time-high-but-why/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。最近比特币挖矿算力急剧下降，导致了7天平均比特币挖矿算力的新高峰。这种下降可能是由于比特币价格下跌导致的挖矿收入下降，挖矿难度创新高以及即将到来的减半事件引起的。挖矿者可能会因此选择离开网络，以避免损失。当前比特币价格约为68000美元，过去一周下跌5%。 <div>
<p>On-chain data shows the Bitcoin mining hashrate has registered a plunge from the fresh all-time high (ATH) it had just recently set.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Mining Hashrate Has Dived Down Recently</h2>
<p>As the Bitcoin network works on the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/ethereum-proof-of-work-fork-dates-unveiled/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">proof-of-work (PoW)</a> consensus mechanism, validators called miners have to compete with each other using computing power to get a chance to add the next block to the chain.</p>
<p>The total measure of this computing power that&#8217;s currently connected to the BTC blockchain is known as the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-hashrate-rebounds-smashes-all-time-high/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">&#8220;mining hashrate</a>.&#8221; This metric can directly correlate to the security of the network, since if a malicious entity has to succeed in an attack, it has to take over at least 51% of the total computing power.</p>

<p>Naturally, when the hashrate goes up, so does the resistance of the blockchain, as there is more machines to hack before the 51% target can be achieved. This is only, of course, given that the new hashrate being added is sufficiently decentralized.</p>
<p>Now, here is a chart that shows the trend in the 7-day average Bitcoin mining hashrate over the past year:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Bitcoin Mining Hashrate" class="alignnone wp-image-287897 size-large" height="411" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/chart_cab8de.png?resize=980%2C411" width="980" /></p>

<p>As displayed in the above graph, the 7-day average Bitcoin mining hashrate set a new ATH just a few days back. Since then, though, the indicator&#8217;s value has plunged down.</p>
<p>This decline would suggest that some miners have decided to disconnect from the blockchain. As for why this drop in the metric has occurred, there are likely to be a few reasons contributing to the trend.</p>
<p>The first and perhaps the most obvious is the fact that the Bitcoin price itself has plummeted from its latest high. Miners get their revenue from two sources, the block rewards and transaction fees, but the former is the one that makes up for the majority of their income.</p>
<p>The block rewards also happen to remain fixed in their BTC value, meaning that their USD value is really the only variable for the revenue of the miners as a whole. Obviously, when the asset&#8217;s price goes up, so does the value of these rewards.</p>
<p>With the recent price drop, the miner revenue has also tumbled in value. The miners who were already observing thin margins, like those situated in places with high electricity prices, may have decided it&#8217;s not worth staying connected to the network after the price drawdown.</p>
<p>At the same time as the crash has hit, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-mining-difficulty-soars-7-what-does-it-mean/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">mining difficulty</a> has also shot up to a new ATH. The difficulty is a feature of the Bitcoin network that controls how hard miners would find it to mine on the network.</p>
<p><img alt="Bitcoin Difficulty" class="alignnone wp-image-287898 size-large aligncenter" height="413" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/chart_117c6b.png?resize=980%2C413" width="980" /></p>

<p>The concept of mining difficulty exists so as to ensure that miners can&#8217;t just add extra computing power to the chain to mine new blocks faster and receive new rewards faster.</p>
<p>The implication of the difficulty is that any new hashrate added to the network is essentially new competition for the existing hashrate, as they all compete for the same fixed BTC rewards. With the difficulty now at an ATH, miners&#8217; individual revenues would have naturally taken a hit.</p>

<p>Lastly, there is also the fact that the next halving, an event where BTC&#8217;s block rewards would be permanently slashed in half, is also due next month, which would drastically affect the miners&#8217; income.</p>
<p>Miners around the world would be coming up with strategies to deal with the halving and for some, it may even mean leaving the network behind, at least for now.</p>
<h2>BTC Price</h2>
<p>At the time of writing, Bitcoin is trading around $68,000, down 5% over the past week.</p>

<title>Shiba Inu Burn Rate Sees Incredible 2,300% Increase In One Day – Details</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-burn-rate-2300/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-burn-rate-2300/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的<br />最近，Shiba Inu的销毁率激增，导致SHIB价格大幅反弹。在过去24小时内，Shibburn的数据显示，SHIB销毁数量增长了超过2300％，为195百万个SHIB代币。此举带来了SHIB价格的恢复，之前曾因一波利润回吐而受到打击。同时，Shibarium也似乎开启了其模因币季节，并可能对SHIB价格产生重要影响。Lucie还警告投资者谨慎投资模因币，并建议只用可承受损失的零花钱来投资。截至撰写时，SHIB的价格为$0.00002845，过去24小时涨幅达到了14%。 <div>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-burns-bright-shib/">Shiba Inu (SHIB) burns</a> are again the major talking point in the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/new-shiba-inu-ecosystem-token-march-7/">meme coin’s ecosystem </a>following a recent surge in the burn rate. This has also led to a massive rebound for SHIB’s price, which suffered a sharp correction in the past week due to a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-pepe-whales-sold/">wave of profit-taking</a>.</p>
<h2>Shiba Inu Burns Increase By Over 2,300%</h2>
<p>According to Shiba Inu’s burn tracker, Shibburn, <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-8-billion-shib-burned/#:~:text=Over%208%20Billion%20Shiba%20Inu%20Burned%20In%20The%20Last%2024%20Hours&amp;text=As%20a%20result%20of%20this,transferred%20to%20a%20dead%20wallet." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">SHIB’s burn rate</a> increased by over 2,300% in the last 24 hours, with 195 million SHIB tokens burned during this period. This development has also provided a much-needed recovery to the meme coin’s price, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-whale-dumps-substantial-holdings-on-the-market-heres-how-much/#:~:text=Dogecoin%20Whale%20Offloads%2086%20Million,meme%20coin&#039;s%20recent%20price%20surge.">which declined by over 18%</a> last week. </p>

<p>SHIB has <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/shiba-inu/shiba-inu-shib-0-0008-ath/#:~:text=SHIB&#039;s%20all%2Dtime%20high%20(ATH,a%20new%20ATH%20very%20possible." rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">been on the rise</a> in the past few weeks, even climbing to the number 10 spot of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-dogecoin-shib-excitement/">largest crypto tokens</a> by market cap. However, its run was halted last week by a wave of profit-taking from crypto whales who saw the meme coin’s recent price surge as an avenue to profit from their investment in the crypto token. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the recent increase in the burn rate and SHIB’s price reacting positively to it will undoubtedly excite the SHIB community, especially as the broader crypto market continues to lag. Shiba Inu’s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-lead-dev-shib-bull/">boldly claimed</a> that the meme coin would lead this bull market, and SHIB’s price recovering nicely after every dip can help strengthen that narrative. </p>
<h2>Shibarium Also Having Its Meme Season?</h2>
<p><a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shib-2024/">Shiba Inu’s Marketing Lead, Lucie</a>, recently <a href="https://x.com/LucieSHIB/status/1769565972841607589?s=20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">hinted</a> at a meme coin season brewing on the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-shibarium-public/">layer-2 network, Shibarium</a>. She added that the SHIB ecosystem has had success with memes, seeing how tokens like <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shibarium-shiba-inu-price/">SHIB, BONE, and LEASH</a> have experienced impressive growth since launching. </p>

<p>Shibarium&#8217;s meme coin season could be very significant for SHIB’s price in the short term, given the impact that Solana’s meme coin season has had on the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-price-2-year-high/">SOL token</a>. Shibarium seeing more traders invest in memes on the network would increase network activity and ultimately cause more SHIB tokens to be burned. <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bone-binance-shiba-inu-army-campaigns-for-listing/">BONE, Shibarium’s utility token</a>, will also benefit from such development. </p>
<p>Lucie was also quick to <a href="https://x.com/LucieSHIB/status/1769573220510814587?s=20" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">warn</a> traders about the risk involved in investing in meme coins, noting that they shouldn’t be taken as “serious investments.” Therefore, she advised them against selling their investments to invest in memes. Instead, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-meme-coin-trader/">meme trading</a> should only be done with pocket money that one can afford to lose, Lucie added. </p>
<p>At the time of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.00002845, up by 14% in the last 24 hours according to <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/shiba-inu/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">data</a> from CoinMarketCap. </p>

<title>Weekly Crypto Preview: Major Events And Trends To Watch</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/weekly-crypto-preview-major-events-trends/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/weekly-crypto-preview-major-events-trends/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。<br />本周比特币和加密市场将受到几个关键事件的影响，如中央银行利率决定、Nvidia GTC会议和Etherfi的推出。中央银行利率决定可能影响比特币和其他加密货币，特别是美联储的决定。Nvidia GTC会议将提升几个以人工智能为重点的加密货币的地位，如NEAR和Render。此外，Etherfi推出ETHFI代币，通过液态重新抵押协议，用户可以在不锁定资产的情况下获得以太坊的利息奖励。 <div>
<p>This week in the Bitcoin and crypto markets is marked by several pivotal events that could significantly influence investor sentiment and market dynamics. Among them, central bank interest rate decisions, the Nvidia GTC conference, and the launch of Etherfi are particularly noteworthy. Below is an in-depth preview of these events and their potential impact on the crypto landscape.</p>
<h2>#1 FOMC Meeting Looming: How Will Bitcoin And Crypto React?</h2>
<p>Central banks representing nearly half of the global economy are slated to announce key interest rate decisions this week, affecting six of the ten most traded currencies. This series of decisions, the largest so far for 2024, includes announcements from the United States, Switzerland, Australia, the United Kingdom, Japan, among others.</p>
<img alt="Central bank decisions this week" class="size-full wp-image-287870" height="508" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GI4FCFCWwAAI3n4.png?resize=823%2C508" width="823" />
<p>These moves could indicate how central bankers perceive the current risk of inflation, with significant implications for the<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dollar-currency-index-dxy-crypto-bitcoin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> US dollar index (DXY)</a> and, inversely, for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The highlight of the week is the US Federal Reserve&#8217;s interest rate decision on Wednesday, March 20. Interest rates are expected to remain at their current level, with a 98% probability, as per the CME Fed Watch tool.</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs noted in a research <a href="https://twitter.com/MikeZaccardi/status/1769482598537904259" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">memo</a>, “Inflation has been firmer in recent months [&#8230;] We now expect 3 cuts in 2024, mainly because of the slightly higher inflation path [&#8230;] We suspect that the Fed leadership is also still targeting a first cut in June.” This narrative underscores a cautious approach to rate adjustments, reflecting a nuanced understanding of current economic indicators and their potential impact.</p>
<p>This upcoming FOMC meeting is particularly significant for the crypto market. Recently, the correlation between the Bitcoin and crypto market with the broader macroeconomic factors has strengthened, highlighted by Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies&#8217; price movements in reaction to<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-rockets-to-new-all-time-high-amid-cpi-surge-and-elon-musks-crypto-critique-of-dxy/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> hotter-than-expected US CPI and PPI data.</a> The anticipation of the “higher for longer” interest rates by the US Fed has led to market volatility, underscoring the importance of this week&#8217;s FOMC meeting for digital assets.</p>
<h2>#2 Nvidia GTC: NEAR, Render (RNDR) And AI Coins On The Rise</h2>
<p>The Nvidia GTC conference, a pivotal event for AI and GPU computing enthusiasts, is poised to elevate the profiles of several AI-focused cryptocurrencies. Notably, RNDR, NEAR, TAO, and FET have seen significant price movements in anticipation of the conference.</p>

<p><strong>NEAR In Focus: </strong>NEAR Protocol, a high-performance blockchain designed to provide the infrastructure for decentralized applications, has seen its native token NEAR surge by 125% in the last two weeks.</p>
<p>This uptick is largely attributed to the growing excitement over Nvidia&#8217;s annual conference, where Illia Polosukhin, co-founder and CEO of NEAR Protocol, is scheduled to appear on a panel titled &#8220;Transforming AI,&#8221; hosted by Nvidia&#8217;s founder and CEO, Jensen Huang.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>Polosukhin&#8217;s participation is highly anticipated, as it could signal NEAR&#8217;s deeper foray into AI applications and potential collaborations with Nvidia. This has sparked significant interest in the NEAR token as investors and enthusiasts speculate on the future integrations and innovations that may arise from this intersection of blockchain and AI.</p>
<p>The upcoming release of Near Tasks, an AI facet of NEAR&#8217;s ecosystem, further fueled speculation about the protocol&#8217;s commitment to leveraging AI within its infrastructure. This move could potentially position NEAR as a key player in the emerging field of decentralized AI, offering scalable and efficient solutions for AI applications.</p>

<p><strong>Render Network Spotlight:</strong> Jules Urbach, founder of Render Network, is <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/render-founder-nvidias-gtc-in-4-days-rndr-surge-ahead/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">set to deliver</a> a highly anticipated talk at the Nvidia GTC conference. His presentation, titled &#8220;The Future of Rendering: Real-Time Ray Tracing, AI, Holographic Displays, and the Blockchain,&#8221; promises to offer insights into the future of digital content creation and the role of decentralized networks in supporting these advancements.</p>
<p>Urbach&#8217;s history of impactful presentations at GTC, including his collaboration with Nvidia&#8217;s Jensen Huang in 2013, suggests that this year&#8217;s talk could have significant implications for the Render Network and the broader ecosystem of GPU computing and AI.</p>
<p>“I think it will be one of my most relevant GTC talks, and a reflection of the next paradigm shift we are entering for distributed GPU systems, on par with the first one back in 2013 — when I took the stage with Jensen to announce Render’s centralized precursor (ORC) and then launched with AWS,” Urbach stated looking ahead</p>
<h2>#3 Etherfi Launch</h2>
<p>Etherfi, a leading liquid restaking protocol, is set to launch its ETHFI token today, March 18, marking a significant development in the DeFi space. The launch on Binance&#8217;s Launchpool will enable users to stake BNB or FDUSD tokens to farm ETHFI tokens, offering early access to rewards and project engagement.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Following a successful $23 million Series A funding round, EtherFi&#8217;s total value locked (TVL) has surged to $2.9 billion, according to DefiLlama <a href="https://defillama.com/protocol/ether.fi" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">data</a>. The protocol&#8217;s innovative approach to liquid restaking, allowing users to access Ethereum staking rewards and additional yields without locking up assets, underscores its potential to reshape the Ethereum and broader crypto ecosystem.</p>
<p>Users can stake their Ethereum directly through Etherfi and receive ETHFI tokens in return. These crypto tokens represent the staked Ethereum and accrue staking rewards over time. However, unlike traditional staking, ETHFI tokens can be used within the DeFi ecosystem, offering users the flexibility to participate in other yield-generating activities without sacrificing their staking rewards.</p>
<p>Etherfi leverages EigenLayer, a layer that builds on top of Ethereum, to enable additional yields on top of Ethereum staking rewards. This integration not only enhances the reward structure for stakers but also contributes to the security and scalability of the Ethereum network by leveraging EigenLayer&#8217;s functionalities.</p>

<title>Bitcoin ETF Debate: Jim Bianco Backs Vanguard As He Advocates Caution</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/jim-bianco-backs-vanguard-on-bitcoin-etfs-decision/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/jim-bianco-backs-vanguard-on-bitcoin-etfs-decision/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />文章讨论了SEC批准的加密货币交易所产品，以及Vanguard对比特币交易所产品的立场。Jim Bianco为Vanguard辩护，指出其在ETF市场中的成功表现。文章还提到Vanguard的CEO Tim Buckley表示公司不会投资比特币ETF，并解释该决定是基于公司的3000万基金持有者的意见，他们不感兴趣。文章最后澄清了Buckley是否离开Vanguard以及相关细节。Jim Bianco的论点从整体上凸显了Vanguard在ETF市场中的出色表现。 <div>
<p>The cryptocurrency market has witnessed a major turning point following the approval of <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-markets-swell-in-2024-spotlight-bitcoin-etfs/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Bitcoin Spot Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)</a> by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on January 11. However, despite its intriguing growth over time, several popular figures in the crypto landscape are still against the exchange products.</p>
<h2>Jim Biance Defends Vanguard&#8217;s Position Toward Bitcoin Spot ETFs</h2>
<p>President and founder of Bianco Research, Jim Bianco, has taken to the X platform to <a href="https://x.com/biancoresearch/status/1769386975851593875?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">reveal</a> his insights regarding Vanguard&#8217;s stance against Bitcoin exchange-traded products while highlighting the company&#8217;s huge success without adopting the ETFs.</p>

<p>Bianco has highlighted several significant perspectives the community should consider regarding the subject. He believes that &#8220;Vanguard is the 850-pound gorilla&#8221; in the ETF market, while asset management firm &#8220;BlackRock is the 800-pound gorilla.&#8221;</p>
<p>According to Jim, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/blackrock-bitcoin-etf-gobbles-up-nearly-196000-btc/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Blackrock</a>&#8216;s ETF assets were valued at $2.84 trillion as of March 15. Meanwhile, about $18.19 billion was invested in all of their ETFs in the past week, with $2.6 billion going into IBIT.</p>
<p>He further drew a comparison to Vanguard&#8217;s assets, which were valued at $2.58 trillion, amassing approximately $29.44 billion inflow into all their ETFs last week, with zero invested in Bitcoin ETFs. This information demonstrates Vanguard&#8217;s strong results in the larger ETF industry, which has made it one of the best-performing firms in the market over time.</p>
<p>Bianco&#8217;s insights came in light of the criticism from the crypto community after Vanguard&#8217;s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Tim Buckley disclosed the company&#8217;s decision to not invest BTC ETFs.</p>
<p>In a video released by Vanguard, Tim Buckley stated that the firm &#8220;does not have plans to offer Bitcoin spot ETFs.&#8221; This is because it is not considered a &#8220;store of value&#8221; and does not belong in a &#8220;long-term portfolio.&#8221;</p>
<p>In spite of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cathie-wood-vanguards-stance-terrible/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">critiques</a> from the community, the CEO restated the firm&#8217;s viewpoint, which remained unaltered. He further declared that unless there was a &#8220;major shift in Bitcoin&#8217;s asset class,&#8221; Vanguard would continue to uphold its decision not to provide the products.</p>
<h2>A 30 Million Fundholders Decision</h2>
<p>Bianco also pointed out that the company&#8217;s decision was a result of 30 million fundholders &#8220;who are not interested in Bitcoin,&#8221; and Tim Buckley was just an &#8220;effective spokesman&#8221; for these fundholders.</p>
<p>He stated:</p>
<blockquote><p>Vanguard is not publicly owned. It is mutual, which means the fundholders own the company and Buckly is effectively the spokesman for these 30 million fundholders, who tell him they are not interested in BTC.</p></blockquote>
<p>These fundholders believe that Vanguard&#8217;s main focus should be on improving its customer service, not BTC because the firm has grown so &#8220;quickly and so successful.&#8221;</p>

<p>So far, Bianco has refuted claims within the crypto community about Buckley leaving Vanguard, stating that the CEO is retiring rather than being let go. &#8220;He is staying for another nine and half months as he is retiring at the end of the year,&#8221; he added.</p>

<title>Solana DeFi TVL Rockets 80%: Anticipating The Impact On SOL Price</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/solana-defi-tvl-rockets-80-impact-on-sol-price/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/solana-defi-tvl-rockets-80-impact-on-sol-price/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。Solana的DeFi活动激增，TVL达到38亿美元，交易量增长125%，超越以太坊。SOL币价上涨70%，市场乐观情绪高涨。分析指出OBV和CMF指标支持SOL继续上涨。Solana迅速发展的DeFi生态系统和网络活动使其在加密货币市场中成为令人瞩目的参与者。 <div>
<p>Solana, the blockchain network known for its speed and scalability, has witnessed an unprecedented surge in decentralized finance (DeFi) activity, propelling its native token, SOL, to new heights.</p>
<p>Not only has Solana&#8217;s DeFi total value locked (TVL) soared by over 80% in the past month, but its network activity has also surpassed that of Ethereum, further solidifying its position as a leading player in the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<h2><strong>Solana Shines With Soaring DeFi TVL </strong></h2>
<p>On the back of impressive growth,<a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Solana" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> Solana&#8217;s DeFi TVL</a> has reached its highest level in the last two years, currently standing at an impressive $3.8 billion, according to data from DefiLlama.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-287845" height="309" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_0cd344.png?resize=1024%2C309" width="1024" /></p>

<p>This surge in TVL can be attributed to a substantial uptick in trading volume on the DeFi protocols built on the altcoin&#8217;s Layer 1 network (L1). Since the beginning of the month, the daily trading volume on these protocols has experienced an astonishing 125% increase.</p>

<h2><strong>Altcoin&#8217;s Network Activity Up As Well</strong></h2>
<p>However, it is not just the DeFi metrics that showcase Solana&#8217;s remarkable performance. The network&#8217;s activity has recently surpassed that of Ethereum, the world&#8217;s leading blockchain platform.</p>
<p>Solana&#8217;s solid infrastructure and low transaction fees have attracted traders and investors seeking opportunities amidst a turbulent market. As a result, Solana&#8217;s total trading volume on March 16 exceeded Ethereum&#8217;s daily volume by more than $1.1 billion, reaching an impressive $3.52 billion, as reported by DefiLlama.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-287840" height="386" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_cd27e4.png?resize=956%2C386" width="956" /></p>

<p>The combination of Solana&#8217;s explosive DeFi growth and network activity has had a profound impact on the value of the<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/solana" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> SOL token.</a> Trading at $207 at the time of writing, SOL has experienced a remarkable 70% increase in value over the past month, defying the market&#8217;s downward trend.</p>
<p>While other cryptocurrencies grapple with price reversals, SOL continues to surge, buoyed by bullish sentiment and growing demand.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/7lHtcpS3/" width="2475" /></p>

<p>Analysts have pointed to key indicators, such as the On-Balance-Volume (OBV) and Chaikin Money Flow (CMF), which further validate SOL&#8217;s upward trajectory. The OBV, which tracks buying and selling pressure, has witnessed a steady uptrend, signaling a growth in buying momentum.</p>

<p>The CMF, measuring the flow of money in and out of an asset, confirms the increase in liquidity inflow into the SOL market. These indicators suggest a sustained positive sentiment surrounding SOL.</p>
<p>The remarkable growth of Solana&#8217;s DeFi ecosystem, coupled with its<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-network-forces-binance-to-halt-withdrawals/"> surge in network activity</a>, has positioned the blockchain as a formidable player in the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p>As the industry continues to evolve, Solana&#8217;s ability to attract DeFi participants, generate substantial revenue through network fees, and defy market trends bodes well for its future prospects.</p>

<title>Shiba Inu: Data Reveals Big Surge Edging Bitcoin, Ethereum Despite Setbacks</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-data-reveals-big-surge-edging-bitcoin/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-data-reveals-big-surge-edging-bitcoin/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章介绍了2024年热门的meme币市场，以及Shiba Inu（SHIB）在2024年悄悄夺得了风头。SHIB的价格大幅上涨，主要得益于在2022年推出的Ethereum Layer 2网络Shibarium的广泛采用。与此同时，比特币和以太坊虽然也有不错的增长，但在面对Shiba Inu的表现时显得较为谨慎。市场分析师预计SHIB还有进一步上涨的潜力，可能会达到更高的价位。文章中展示了这些市场趋势以及可能的未来发展。 <div>
<p>Move over, Bitcoin and Ethereum. The meme coin market is barking mad with Shiba Inu (SHIB) quietly stealing the show in 2024. While the big dogs have been grabbing headlines with new all-time highs, the self-proclaimed &#8220;Doge Killer&#8221; has been on a tear, outperforming its established rivals with a nearly 210% year-to-date (YTD) surge.</p>
<p>While Bitcoin and Ethereum have garnered significant attention for their price performance, Shiba Inu has quietly outpaced both, achieving impressive growth and capturing the interest of investors and analysts alike.</p>
<h2><strong>Shiba Inu&#8217;s Meteoric Rise: A Tale of Adoption And Innovation</strong></h2>
<p>Shiba Inu&#8217;s SHIB token has witnessed a staggering 246% price increase since the beginning of the year, reaching a peak of $0.00003599 before settling at a slightly lower but still remarkable price of $0.00002779. This unexpected surge has propelled Shiba Inu into the spotlight, raising questions about the factors behind its success.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-287810" height="384" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_ae9088.png?resize=635%2C384" width="635" /></p>

<p>At the time of writing, SHIB was trading at $0.000028,<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/shiba-inu" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank"> up 10% in the last 24 hours,</a> but shed 17% in the last seven days, data from Coingecko shows.</p>

<p>The key driver behind Shiba Inu&#8217;s remarkable performance lies in the burgeoning adoption and utilization of <a href="https://www.shibariumscan.io/stats" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Shibarium,</a> an Ethereum Layer 2 network introduced by the Shiba Inu ecosystem in August 2022. Shibarium has overcome initial challenges and gained significant traction, with major crypto platforms like Gate.io integrating the network.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-287802" height="210" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_353e12.png?resize=1024%2C210" width="1024" /></p>

<p>This integration has facilitated the processing of over 410 million transactions on Shibarium, demonstrating its robustness and efficiency compared to other Layer 2 solutions. The widespread adoption of Shibarium has fueled optimism among investors, contributing to the token&#8217;s price surge.</p>
<h2><strong>Bitcoin And Ethereum: Steady Growth Amidst The Shiba Inu Storm</strong></h2>
<p>While Shiba Inu has stolen the limelight, Bitcoin and Ethereum have also experienced substantial growth this year, albeit at a more measured pace. Bitcoin has breached its previous all-time high, reaching new price discovery territory as it surpassed multiple resistance points above $70,000. Despite setting new records, Bitcoin&#8217;s year-to-date (YTD) gain stands at a steady 65%, starting the year at $42 and currently trading at $68,049.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="1163" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/z62Jr1HJ/" width="2475" /></p>
<p>Ethereum, on the other hand, has demonstrated impressive price performance, soaring above several resistance levels to trade at $3,840 at the time of writing. Beginning the year at $2,280, Ethereum has slightly outperformed Bitcoin with a YTD increase of 68.5%. While these gains are significant, they pale in comparison to Shiba Inu&#8217;s remarkable 246% surge.</p>

<strong>Potential For Further Growth: A Promising Horizon</strong>
<p>Despite its impressive rally, the memecoin is still 170% away from reclaiming its 2021 all-time high, while Bitcoin has already surpassed its previous peak. This discrepancy has led market analysts to anticipate even more substantial price surges for SHIB, as it suggests significant room for growth. As a result, price projections predicting rallies towards the $0.01 territory have emerged, further fueling investor excitement.</p>

<title>Cardano Founder Dispels FUD: Insights On Hydra, Scaling And Partnerships</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-founder-fud-hydra-scaling-partnerships/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-founder-fud-hydra-scaling-partnerships/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。查尔斯·霍金森在周末的一系列消息中解决了关于Cardano项目的各种关切和谣言，特别是关于Hydra的发展、伙伴关系和区块链的整体扩展策略。霍金森驳斥了有关Hydra项目被取消的传言，并提供了关于DIS合作伙伴关系、ERC20转换器等各种倡议的时间表。他还澄清了有关World Mobile合作伙伴关系以及伙伴链的误解。霍金森的讨论重新确认了Cardano团队对以安全和可持续的方式扩展网络的承诺，同时推动区块链技术潜力的边界。ADA目前在0.696美元交易。 <div>
<p>In a series of messages over the weekend, Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, addressed various concerns and rumors circulating about the project, specifically regarding the development of Hydra, partnerships, and the overall scaling strategy for the blockchain.</p>
<h2>Cardano Founder Debunks FUD</h2>
<p>Hoskinson <a href="https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">began</a> by addressing rumors that the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-founder-debunks-hydra-scaling-issues/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Hydra protocol</a> had been abandoned, labeling such claims as baseless fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). &#8220;I&#8217;m seeing some videos claiming that Hydra has been abandoned. It is just pure FUD. The team has never been more productive and motivated, there is great community engagement and new papers on the way for enhancements to the protocol,&#8221; Hoskinson stated. He directed those curious about the project to the official Hydra website for the latest information.</p>
<p>When confronted with a barrage of questions regarding the timeline for various initiatives such as the DISH partnership, the ERC20 converter, activities in Ethiopia, other <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-strengthen-its-ecosystem-africa-partnership/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">African ventures</a>, and a partnership in Mongolia, Hoskinson provided a comprehensive update.</p>

<p>He highlighted the successful deployment of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/game-on-cardano-erc-20-convertor-coming-soon-to-testnet/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">ERC20 converter</a>, which facilitated <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-backed-singularitynet-sets-in-switzerland/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">SingularityNET</a>&#8216;s transition to Cardano, making it a billion-dollar asset. Hoskinson further noted, “Our Africa work continues through John via the RealFi company, we successfully trained developers in Mongolia and concluded pilots with all the entities mentioned. Sorry, try again.”</p>
<p>Further addressing queries about scaling Cardano, Hoskinson encouraged viewers to watch a detailed video that outlines Cardano&#8217;s preparedness for scaling challenges in a decentralized, secure, and high-integrity manner. He underscored Cardano&#8217;s achievements, including over 2300 days of continuous operation, as evidence of the project&#8217;s resilience and commitment to its founding principles.</p>
<p>“Cardano is best positioned to meet these challenges in a decentralized, secure, and high integrity way. Never forget what we&#8217;ve accomplished together with over 2300+ days uptime 24/7 while maintaining our principles,” Hoskinson said.</p>
<h2>Clarifications On The World Mobile Partnership</h2>
<p>Regarding the skepticism and negativity directed towards Cardano, Hoskinson <a href="https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1769452455257845806" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">speculated</a>, &#8220;Man, it&#8217;s raining FUD this weekend, and I&#8217;m not sure about the origin. I guess it&#8217;s that time of the cycle where everyone freaks out about Cardano&#8217;s potential and roadmap, so they throw a wave of FUD at us.&#8221;</p>

<p>He provided insights into the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-africa-special-iog-partners-with-world-mobile-to-connect-250k-people/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">partnership with World Mobile</a>, emphasizing the project&#8217;s ambitious goals. &#8220;No current system in the entire blockchain ecosystem is capable or has technology to resolve a project at this scale involving billions of users. That&#8217;s why World Mobile is building it,&#8221; Hoskinson explained.</p>
<p>Clarifying misconceptions about partnerchains, Hoskinson emphasized that they are indeed part of Cardano, contrary to some community misunderstandings. Partnerchains are designed to allow for the development of hypercomplex projects with unique protocols, such as different consensus mechanisms, ledger rules, and transaction semantics. He pointed out that this flexibility is crucial for projects like World Mobile and decentralized social networks, aiming to connect the unconnected through a decentralized network with equal and fair rules.</p>
<p>Hoskinson&#8217;s discourse over the weekend provided not only rebuttals to the circulating FUD but also reaffirmed the strategic direction and robust foundation upon which Cardano is building its future. His statements reinforce the commitment of the Cardano team to scale the network securely and sustainably while pushing the boundaries of blockchain technology&#8217;s potential.</p>
<p>At press time, ADA traded at $0.696.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。加密货币市场目睹了Shiba Inu（SHIB）代币的巨额转移，令人震惊。1万亿SHIB代币（相当于2881.4万美元）被转移到了Gate.io这家主要的加密货币交易所。同时，Shiba Inu社区对即将到来的Shiba Eternity游戏的更新感到兴奋，计划在未来的季度进行游戏的Beta测试。尽管SHIB市场经历了一段动荡时期，但近一个月来一直表现出色，价格上涨了194%。然而，最近大量SHIB代币流入Gate.io给市场的稳定性带来了阴影，让SHIB社区感到不安。liquidation surge和game development的信息会加剧这种不确定性。 <div>
<p>Cryptocurrency markets witnessed seismic activity as Whale Alert, a leading service tracking large crypto transactions, reported a monumental transfer of Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens. A staggering 1 trillion SHIB, equivalent to $28,814,000, was observed in transit from an undisclosed wallet to the portals of Gate.io, a major cryptocurrency exchange.</p>

<p>The colossal transfer sent shockwaves through the crypto community, prompting intense speculation about its implications. While the sender&#8217;s identity remains a mystery, such massive movements to exchanges often signal imminent sales or significant trading activity. This revelation injected a surge of volatility into the SHIB market, leaving traders on edge.</p>

<h2><strong>Navigating Uncertainty Amid Liquidation Surge</strong></h2>
<p>As the SHIB market grappled with uncertainty, investors faced a tumultuous landscape of fluctuating prices and heightened liquidations. In the past 24 hours, SHIB experienced a <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/shiba-inu" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">significant downturn</a>, with prices plummeting by 14.27%.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/UuMIqmgN/" width="1835" /></p>

<p>Adding to market jitters, data from CoinGlass revealed a surge in liquidations totaling a staggering $5,280,000. Of this amount, $4,080,000 stemmed from long liquidations, while $1,200,000 resulted from short liquidations.</p>

<strong>Shiba Inu Shows Resilience</strong>
<p>Despite the recent dip, SHIB has demonstrated <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-active-addresses-soar-over-170/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">remarkable resilience</a> over the past month, boasting a staggering 194% increase following a substantial rally. However, the influx of SHIB tokens to Gate.io has cast a shadow of doubt over the market&#8217;s stability, leaving the SHIB community on edge.</p>

<title>Nigeria SEC To Hike VASP Registration Fees Under New Regime – Details</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/nigeria-sec-to-hike-vasp-registration-fees-under/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/nigeria-sec-to-hike-vasp-registration-fees-under/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。尼日利亚证券交易委员会提议提高虚拟资产服务提供商（VASP）寻求运营许可的注册费用。此外，其他规定的变化也包括加密行业的主要方面。VASP的注册费用将增加400％，最低实收资本要求也将提高。文章还谈到了尼日利亚与币安交易所的争议，以及加密市场的最新数据。 <div>
<p>Nigeria&#8217;s Securities and Exchange Commission has proposed to raise the registration fees for virtual asset service providers (VASP) seeking an operational license. This development is accompanied by other changes in the regulations governing the key aspects of the crypto industry in the West African country.</p>

<h2>VASP Registration Fees In Nigeria To Rise By 400%</h2>
<p>On March 15, the Nigerian SEC released a<a href="https://sec.gov.ng/proposed-major-amendment-to-the-rules-on-issuance-offering-platforms-and-custody-of-digital-assets-to-stakeholders-and-the-general-public/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> set of proposed amendments</a> to its Rules on Digital Assets Issuance, Offering Platforms, Exchange, and Custody. According to the securities regulator, the suggested changes are aimed at providing more regulatory clarity to a rapidly developing crypto market as well as implementing feedback from industry players following recent discussions with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). </p>
<p>Of all the updated regulations, a quintupling increase in VASP registration fees from 30 million ($18,841.75) to 150 million ($94,208.76) has been a major talking point as such policies are usually viewed as a means of discouraging business participation, in this case, the emergence of new crypto exchanges. Meanwhile, it could also function as a protective mechanism, thus ensuring that only sturdy and well-funded parties are able to operate as VASPs.</p>
<p>Furthermore, crypto exchanges and trading platforms would now be expected to pay an application fee and processing fee of 300,000 naira ($188.42) and 1,000,000 naira ($628.06) as opposed to previous values of 100,000 ($62.81) and 300,000 ($188.42) respectively. </p>
<p>In addition, the country&#8217;s regulator has also raised the minimum paid-up capital for these businesses to 1,000,000,000 naira ($628,058.40) which must be set in bank balances, fixed assets, or as an investment in certain securities. Meanwhile, there will be a fidelity bond covering up to 25% of this minimum paid-up capital in line with the Commission’s existing rules and regulations. </p>

<h2>The Nigerian Crypto Space And Its Troubles</h2>
<p>Lately, Nigeria has been among major crypto headlines due to an ongoing squabble with prominent crypto exchange Binance. The government of the West African nation has accused Binance of playing a significant role in the devaluation of Nigerian Naira, demanding compensation to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/nigeria-fines-binance-10-billion/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">the tune of $10 billion. </a></p>
<p>This accusation has been accompanied by the Nigerian government making other demands of Binance in terms of user data and reportedly<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/nigeria-detains-binances-crypto-crime-investigator/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> detaining two of the exchange’s top executives</a>. In response, Binance <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-suspends-all-operations-in-nigeria/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">has shut down all Nigerian Naira (NGN) services</a> as well as delisted Naira trading pairs on its platform. However, there are still no indications the exchange will pull out of the African nation. </p>
<p>At the time of writing, the total crypto market cap is valued at $2.52 trillion, following a 4.23% decline in the last day. Meanwhile, Bitcoin, the market leader, now trades at $66,275.63 due to an ongoing price correction.</p>

<title>Shibarium Breaks The Internet (Again) With Over 400 Million Layer-2 Transactions</title>

<div> <br /><br />摘要: 这些信息是积极的<br />
SHIB的Layer-2区块链Shibarium达到了惊人的交易吞吐量里程碑，表现出了平台的稳定性和潜力。其与K9 Finance的战略合作有助于拓展生态系统，推动创新。尽管SHIB价格受到市场波动的影响，但SHIB的发展努力受到认可，被列入福布斯投资加密货币前十名，并受到金融节目《关注你的金钱》的关注。 <div>
<p>Shibarium, the Layer-2 blockchain developed by the creative minds behind Shiba Inu (SHIB), has shattered expectations by reaching an extraordinary milestone in transaction throughput. Surpassing an impressive<a href="https://www.shibariumscan.io/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> 411 million transactions,</a>   Shibariumscan has revealed the platform&#8217;s resilience in the face of market volatility.</p>

<p>The recent surge in user adoption and the influx of dApp builders have contributed to Shibarium&#8217;s exponential growth. Over the past few days alone, more than 3 million transfers have been added, solidifying Shibarium&#8217;s position as a force to be reckoned with in the blockchain space.</p>
<p>This achievement is particularly impressive given the current daily transaction throughput of 1.03 million, which, although lower than its peak of 4.2 million transfers per day on February 20, reflects the platform&#8217;s stability and potential for further expansion.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-287675" height="222" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_e0e426.png?resize=1024%2C222" width="1024" /></p>

<h2><strong>Shibarium Forges Strategic Partnership, Expanding Its Ecosystem</strong></h2>
<p>In a move to fortify its ecosystem and foster innovation, Shibarium has recently formed a strategic partnership with K9 Finance, a prominent player in the financial technology industry.</p>
<p>This collaboration marks a significant milestone for both parties, as K9 Finance launches its native coin, KNINE, on the Shibarium platform. As a testament to their commitment, Shytoshi Kusama, the visionary leader behind SHIB, and Kaal Dhairya, the brilliant SHIB lead developer, have been appointed as official advisors to K9 Finance.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-partner-token-featured-on-us-tv-station/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">partnership between Shibarium and K9 Finance</a> showcases the platform&#8217;s dedication to fostering collaborations that drive growth and fuel its mission to revolutionize the blockchain landscape. This strategic alliance will undoubtedly open doors to new possibilities, leading to enhanced user experiences and the creation of innovative decentralized applications.</p>
<h2><strong>SHIB Navigates Challenging Waters Amidst Market Turbulence</strong></h2>
<p>While Shibarium celebrates its record-breaking achievements, the price of<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-active-addresses-soar-over-170/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> Shiba Inu</a> (SHIB), the second-largest meme cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has experienced a turbulent ride in recent days.</p>
<p>Exhibiting a correlation with the price movements of Bitcoin (BTC), SHIB has encountered a 28% decrease in value following Bitcoin&#8217;s correction from its all-time high of $73,750.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/KHvF4SWB/" width="1835" /></p>

<p>Investors may find these price fluctuations discouraging, but it is crucial to consider the broader context of SHIB&#8217;s ongoing development efforts. Notably, SHIB received recognition and was featured on Forbes&#8217; prestigious top 10 list of cryptocurrencies to invest in.</p>

<p>Additionally, the cryptocurrency garnered attention on the popular financial program &#8220;Eye on Your Money,&#8221; where it was mentioned alongside Bitcoin. While these accolades did not result in immediate price surges, they reinforce SHIB&#8217;s potential and the significance of its long-term growth prospects.</p>

<title>Crypto Analyst Sets $5 Target For Cardano Price – Here’s How</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-analyst-sets-5-target-for-cardano-price-how/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-analyst-sets-5-target-for-cardano-price-how/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />ADA过去一周经历了波动，价格一度上涨至多月高点，但随后暴跌18%。一位知名分析师预测，ADA价格将在未来几个月中涨幅高达670%。当前ADA价格为0.6626美元，市值超过230亿美元。分析师认为ADA价格将在0.55美元和0.80美元之间水平震荡，然后迅速上涨至1.70美元，为未来的5美元突破铺平道路。ADA仍然是前十大加密货币之一。 <div>
<p class="p1">The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-king-of-dead-coins/">price action of Cardano</a> (ADA) over the past week is a story of two halves, with the token notching a new multi-month high early in the week only to crash by over 18% a few days afterward. This recent decline in ADA price reflects a broader bearish climate in the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p class="p1">Interestingly, a renowned crypto analyst on the X platform has put forward an exciting projection for the price of Cardano over the coming months. This latest price analysis suggests that this latest price downturn will be short-lived, with a bullish future on the horizon.</p>
<h2 class="p1">Analyst Predicts Cardano Price To Surge By 670%</h2>
<p class="p1">Popular crypto analyst <a href="https://x.com/ali_charts/status/1769096425407721629?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Ali Martinez took to X</a> to share his latest prognosis on the price of the Cardano token. According to the expert, the cryptocurrency’s current price action seems to be mirroring a pattern from 2018 to 2021.</p>
<p><img alt="Cardano" class="aligncenter wp-image-287623 size-large" height="660" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GI0X0dcXgAAw0Pf.jpeg?resize=955%2C660" width="955" /></p>

<p class="p1">From the highlighted weekly chart, the ADA price only recently broke out of a consolidation zone, which looks like a replica of the 2018 &#8211; 2020 consolidation range. Having retested the upper boundary of the range, the token looks set for a price upswing.</p>

<p class="p1">However, Martinez expects the Cardano price to move horizontally between $0.55 and $0.80 over the coming weeks. This period of sluggish activity will then be followed by a rapid price upswing to $1.70, according to the analyst.</p>
<p class="p1">In his post, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-doge-trading-volume/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Martinez</a> mentioned the possibility of a period of further price consolidation after the over 160% surge to $1.70. This is expected to “set the stage for a breakout to $5” for the Cardano price</p>
<p class="p1">This audacious projection represents an almost 700% surge for the ADA token from the current price point. From the highlighted chart, these bullish moves are expected to occur over the next few months in 2024.</p>
<h2 class="p1">ADA Price Overview</h2>
<p class="p1">As of this writing, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-network-sees-massive-growth-in-new-wallets/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Cardano token</a> is valued at $0.6626, reflecting a steep 8.3% decline in the past 24 hours. The altcoin, like the general market, has been experiencing a significant amount of bearish pressure over the past few days.</p>

<p class="p1">This dip comes barely three days after <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/analyst-predicts-cardano-price-to-skyrocket-by-1400/">ADA’s price</a> hit $0.8, its highest level in nearly two years. According to data from CoinGecko, the value of cryptocurrency has dropped by more than 18% since then, with a 12% decline in its weekly timeframe.</p>
<p class="p1">Nevertheless, the Cardano token still ranks as one of the ten largest cryptocurrencies in the sector, with a market capitalization of over $23 billion.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要: 这些信息是积极的。<br />约翰·迪顿是一位著名律师和XRP支持者，决定挑战麻省现任参议员伊丽莎白·沃伦，他投入了50万美元的资金进入参议员竞选。他得到了加密社区的支持，包括卡尔达诺创始人查尔斯·霍金森。迪顿对胜选充满信心，认为沃伦容易受到挑战。他利用社交媒体筹集资金，主张自由和加密立场。迪顿的挑战已经引起了媒体的关注，他的竞选策略强调反对传统政治。<br /> <div>
<p>In a bold move, prominent lawyer and XRP proponent John Deaton has made a substantial $500,000 donation to his Senate campaign against incumbent US senator for Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren.</p>
<p>Deaton is presenting a Republican challenge to senator Warren, giving the prominent progressive her first serious, albeit still remote, opponent and setting up an election-season dispute over cryptocurrencies.</p>

<h2><strong>Deaton&#8217;s Campaign Gains Momentum With Crypto Community Support</strong></h2>
<p>Deaton&#8217;s announcement has ignited a surge of support from the crypto community, with many prominent figures expressing their endorsement and willingness to contribute to his campaign.</p>
<p>Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson was among the first to step forward, donating the maximum allowable amount of $3,300. <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/elizabeth-warren-rallies-donors-marine-veteran-crypto-attorney-john-deaton-announces-senate-challenge" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Deaton&#8217;s campaign</a> has also embraced crypto donations, allowing supporters to contribute using various cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>— John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1768759999533334680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">March 15, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<h2><strong>Deaton Confident In Victory, Cites Warren&#8217;s Vulnerabilities</strong></h2>
<p>Despite Warren&#8217;s long-standing presence in Massachusetts politics, Deaton exudes confidence in his ability to secure victory in the upcoming election.</p>
<p>He highlights several factors that indicate Warren&#8217;s vulnerability, including her low favorability ratings and the fact that a significant portion of eligible voters in Massachusetts are neither Democrats nor Republicans.</p>
<p>Deaton believes these factors, coupled with his strong support from the crypto community, give him a fighting chance to unseat the incumbent senator.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/uB97CnpQ/" width="1835" /></p>

<strong>XRP Community Speculates On Deaton&#8217;s Potential Impact On Crypto Regulation</strong>
<p>While Deaton&#8217;s campaign primarily focuses on challenging Warren&#8217;s anti-crypto stance, the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">XRP</a> community is abuzz with speculation about the potential implications of his victory for the ongoing Ripple lawsuit.</p>
<p>Deaton&#8217;s extensive legal experience and vocal support for the crypto industry have led many to believe that his election could positively influence the outcome of the case.</p>
<p>However, it remains uncertain whether Deaton&#8217;s involvement in the Senate race will directly impact the Ripple lawsuit.</p>

<strong>Deaton&#8217;s Fundraising Efforts And Campaign Strategy</strong>
<p>To bolster his campaign&#8217;s financial resources, Deaton has set an ambitious goal of raising $1 million by March 31st. He has turned to his substantial social media following, primarily crypto enthusiasts, to contribute to the cause.</p>
<p>Deaton&#8217;s campaign strategy emphasizes the importance of freedom and the need for nonpartisan leadership in Washington that represents the interests of ordinary citizens.</p>
<p>He believes that his outsider status and willingness to challenge the status quo resonate with voters disillusioned with traditional politics.</p>
<strong>Media Attention And Recognition Of Deaton&#8217;s Challenge</strong>
<p>Deaton&#8217;s candidacy has garnered significant media attention, with outlets such as Fox Business recognizing him as a major challenger who poses a genuine threat to Warren&#8217;s re-election bid.</p>
<p>His campaign has successfully captured the public&#8217;s imagination, and his message of freedom and crypto advocacy has struck a chord with many voters.</p>
<p>As the race heats up, it remains to be seen whether Deaton&#8217;s grassroots campaign can overcome the challenges posed by Warren&#8217;s incumbency and political establishment support.</p>
