Instead, those narratives were deferred to alternative protocols, mainly Ethereum. However, Bitcoin is now experiencing a renaissance of programmability, largely thanks to two recent innovations, <a href="https://rodarmor.com/blog/ordinal-theory/">Ordinal Theory</a> and <a href="https://bitvm.org/">BitVM</a>.</p><p>After the Ordinals meta-protocol and its BTC-based token standards were launched, it became undeniably clear that the Bitcoin community had a serious appetite for NFTs, fungible tokens, and general programmability. In December of 2023, <a href="https://messari.io/report/state-of-bitcoin-q4-2023#Ecosystem-Analysis">Bitcoin’s NFT sales volume</a> (including BRC-20s, which are technically nonfungible) exceeded that of Ethereum and Solana combined. This is especially significant due to their multiyear head starts of developing NFT communities.</p><p>BitVM, a strategy for executing arbitrary computation anywhere and then verifying it on Bitcoin, opened the door for new bridging mechanisms and ideas for enforcing transaction validity. While certain <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinLayers/status/1770147876376617251">dimensions of Layer-2s</a> (L2s), such as data availability, are more straightforward, Bitcoin L2s will still need innovations in order to scale to support dozens of layers. Up until these recent developments, other functions, such as the aforementioned trustless bridging and enforcing transaction validity, were believed by many to be impossible without a soft fork.</p><p>Ordinal Theory emphasized the demand for added functionality, and then BitVM made expressive and trust-minimized L2s seem possible. This has sparked a frenzy of Bitcoin layers, dubbed the “Bitcoin L2 Season.” However, some teams, such as the Core Foundation, were already building in the Bitcoin ecosystem and were greatly positioned to capitalize on the momentum of Bitcoin layers. While many other layers are still building towards mainnet, Core Chain offers a platform for Bitcoin programmability today.</p><h2>Background</h2><p>Core Chain is a Bitcoin layer (specifically, a sidechain) that uses the EVM and the novel Satoshi Plus consensus mechanism. Satoshi Plus is a combination of Delegated Proof of Work (DPoW) and Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS). It was designed with the goal of retaining Bitcoin’s decentralized security while achieving the scalability of more performant smart contract platforms. Parameters of Satoshi Plus, as well as other facets of the network, are governed in a decentralized fashion by Core DAO (powered by the CORE token). Core Chain is EVM-compatible, similar to Binance Smart Chain’s <a href="https://github.com/bnb-chain/bsc">implementation</a> of Geth. And finally, Core Chain features an enshrined BTC bridge, making BTC available on the network in the form of coreBTC.</p><p>The <a href="https://coredaofoundation.org/">Core Foundation</a> and Core DAO were founded in May 2022. The Core Foundation is self-funded and consists of <a href="https://coredaofoundation.org/team">contributors</a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/richrines/">Rich Rines</a> (previously a transfers engineering lead at Coinbase, and Founder and CEO at AutoReach), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cjreim/">CJ Reim</a> (Co-Founder and Managing Partner Amity Ventures, and a Genesis block Ethereum investor), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lindsey-haswell-5190378/">Lindsey Haswell</a> (previously the Chief Legal Officer at Blockchain.com and MoonPay, and the Regulatory Director at Uber), Jack (with 10 years of technical blockchain and Web3 experience and previously an engineer for BI software), <a href="https://pt.linkedin.com/in/brendonsedo">Brendon Sedo</a> (previously the Founder/CEO of Joist and EHF Investor Fellow), Max (with 18 years of experience as an entrepreneur, engineer, and product designer), and Charles (with a MSc in Computer Science and Theory and previously a senior design developer at multiple Web3 projects).</p><h2>Technology</h2><p>There are four key features of Core Chain that separate it from its competition:</p><ul><li><a href="https://docs.coredao.org/core-white-paper-v1.0.6/satoshi-plus-consensus">Satoshi Plus</a>: the novel consensus mechanism, which is a hybrid of DPoW and DPoS</li><li><a href="https://docs.coredao.org/core-white-paper-v1.0.6/governance">Core DAO</a>: the DAO that manages onchain governance</li><li><a href="https://docs.coredao.org/developer/develop-on-core/building-on-core">EVM</a>: the adapted Ethereum virtual machine for smart contract execution</li><li>coreBTC: the enshrined Core-native bridged BTC</li></ul><h3>Satoshi Plus</h3><p>Core Chain’s biggest differentiator from other Bitcoin layers (and merge-mining in general) is its Satoshi Plus consensus mechanism. Satoshi Plus is a hybrid model of Delegated Proof-of-Work (DPoW) and Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS).</p><p>DPoW is performed by Bitcoin miners and mining pools who delegate their existing Bitcoin hash rate to select validators on Core Chain. DPoS is performed by CORE tokenholders staking/delegating their CORE tokens to select validators on Core Chain. The DPoW hash and DPoS stake contribute to the calculation of a weighted score that determines which validators qualify for the next round of block creation. Certain parameters of the weighting are variable and set by the Core DAO; currently, the weighting ratio is two-thirds to hash and one-third to stake.</p><p>This hybrid model separates block production from Bitcoin miners, which removes any possible incentives for Bitcoin miners to censor Core Chain. This novel approach combats a <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/791.pdf">classic issue</a> with merge-mining (and other forms of parent-child shared security). In this issue, the security provider network can perform MEV or censorship on the child chain with no penalties and no incentives not to, as they are theoretically more aligned with the parent chain than the child chain.</p><h4>Network Participant Roles</h4><p>Participants in Satoshi Plus consensus include Bitcoin miners, CORE stakers, validators, relayers, verifiers, and Core DAO. Together, they secure the Core network through PoW and DPoS, as well as adjust consensus-related variables through an onchain governance process.</p><p><strong>Bitcoin Miners</strong></p><p>Bitcoin miners and mining pools participate in Satoshi Plus consensus by mining Bitcoin blocks and subsequently delegating the blocks to a Core validator in each block they produce. This process involves adding the data to the <a href="https://opcodeexplained.com/opcodes/OP_RETURN.html">op_return</a> field, a data field for including arbitrary data used in many other network functions such as inscriptions. The consensus process signals to the Core network that a miner is delegating their hash to that validator and participating in Satoshi Plus. It comes at no additional cost to the miner, and miners can even include their own Core address in order to receive the CORE tokens distributed in the consensus process.</p><p>Because this process comes at no cost to the miner, it carries no guarantees that a participating Bitcoin miner is aligned with Core. Consequently, block production is managed by a distinct role, the validator, to whom miners delegate their hashing power.</p><p>This flavor of shared security is on an individual opt-in basis per miner. It’s also non-rivalrous, meaning that a single miner does not exclude themself from participating in merge-mining or shared security for another network (e.g., PoX with <a href="https://messari.io/report/state-of-stacks-q4-2023">Stacks</a>) by delegating hash to a Core validator. The exception to this non-rivalrous nature could be if other shared security models also require data to be posted in the op_return field, which has a size limit of 80 bytes.</p><p><strong>CORE Stakers</strong></p><p>CORE token stakers participate in Satoshi Plus by delegating CORE tokens to validators on Core Chain.</p><p><strong>Validators</strong></p><p>Validators take part in Satoshi Plus by both running validator hardware and staking their own CORE tokens. Miners delegate hash, and delegators delegate stake to validators, which, combined with their own stake, create their weighting scores. As an open and permissionless system, validators can also run Bitcoin miners themselves and delegate hash to themselves if they choose.</p><p>Also, liquid staking is <a href="https://medium.com/@core_dao/launching-liquid-staking-on-core-introducing-stcore-657171f52a9f">natively available</a> through the stCORE token. This theoretically increases consensus participation, as users don’t have to choose between staking and utilizing liquidity in DeFi or other protocols.</p><p><strong>Relayers and Verifiers</strong></p><p>Relayers participate in Satoshi Plus by relaying Bitcoin block headers to the Core network via the onchain light client. Like all other roles in Satoshi Plus, the set of relayers is permissionless. Anyone can participate by registering and locking up a refundable CORE token deposit. However, relayers must both register and pass verification in order to earn rewards.</p><p>Verifiers participate in Satoshi Plus by identifying and reporting malicious actions within the network. If successful, validators may have their stake slashed or be jailed outright. Verifiers are compensated for their monitoring when block rewards are dispensed. Acting as a verifier is permissionless.</p><h4>Consensus Process</h4><p><strong>Weighting</strong></p><p>Both hash power (from Bitcoin miners) and staked CORE tokens (from CORE delegators) are combined to create an overall score. The formula for weighting uses only one dynamic variable, the m Parameter. The value of this parameter is set by Core DAO and can be changed at any time through a vote (more on voting in the Governance section). Each validator’s hash and stake are measured as a direct linear percentage of the total value from all validators, and the m Parameter dictates the weighting for hash and stake inversely. In other words, an m Parameter of 0.3 would mean hash represents 30% of the total weight and stake represents 70% of the total stake.</p><p><em>      S = rHp / tHp * m + rSp / tSp * (1 - m)</em></p><p>Where:	</p><p><em>      rHp</em> = hash power delegated to the validator</p><p><em>      tHp </em>= total hash power</p><p><em>      rSp </em>= stake delegated to a validator</p><p><em>      tSp</em> = total stake</p><p><em>      m</em> = a dynamic weighting that can be adjusted over time</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/3aeef19368f9aa6b9d8371ae9fcb80e9b6e5f0b8-1920x1080.png?w=800" /><p>Measuring stake is straightforward, as Satoshi Plus uses a linear voting mechanism (i.e., one CORE token equals one vote). Hash is slightly more complicated, as it’s exogenous. relayers fetch BTC block information to bring Bitcoin’s consensus data into Core Chain’s environment, and block production is used to estimate hash. Hash is represented by the number of blocks produced by any miner, as over the long term, this ratio should be directly equivalent to a miner’s share of the total hashrate.</p><p>Every round (roughly one day), hash power is calculated by counting the number of blocks produced by participating miners from exactly one week prior (i.e., today’s hash delegations are decided by last week’s block production).</p><p><strong>Validator Election and Leader Selection</strong></p><p>The top 21 validators system is ranked by the weighted score of hash and stake. These validators are able to participate in block production. Core uses its Validator Election mechanism to rank the top 21 validators based on hybrid scores, creating the validator set for a consensus period of 200 slots, known as an epoch. Each slot presents an opportunity for a block to be created and lasts 3 seconds. As such, each epoch lasts 600 seconds, or 10 minutes, and gives a validator up to 10 chances to create a block once accepted for an epoch.</p><p>Because slots are distributed in a round-robin pattern, not randomly, each validator is guaranteed at least 9 slots( i.e., opportunities) to create a block. If a validator misbehaves, it can be jailed and subsequently removed from the quorum for the next epoch.</p><p><strong>Rewards</strong></p><p>Block rewards, consisting of both transaction fees and a coinbase reward, are split between validators and the System Reward Contract, which pays out relayers and verifiers.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/6ef149c53afacf2ed8eb7f573d7f921e1add3f71-1920x1080.png?w=800" /><p>Validators receive consensus rewards in the form of both transaction fees and a coinbase reward, all paid in CORE. Validators keep a fee (which they set as their personal commission) and then distribute the rest to miners and delegators. Hash and stake delegators are distributed rewards based on the same m Parameter that dictates the weighting between hash and stake for the Validator Election.</p><p>The System Reward Contract accumulates rewards to pay out both relayers and verifiers, which must be claimed by the parties (rather than automatically sending the tokens, as is done with validator rewards to their delegates). The current maximum caps of rewards held by the contract are 10 million CORE and 1 million CORE for relayers and verifiers, respectively. Any excess CORE rewards are burnt.</p><h3>Ethereum Virtual Machine Compatibility</h3><p>Core Chain uses the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) for its execution environment. While this environment was initially created for Ethereum, it has been adopted by many other networks, including BNB, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync.</p><p>The EVM is the most robust execution environment in crypto, with the most active developers. Solidity, a popular EVM language, is the most popular language among crypto developers. Core Chain gains access to this pervasive ecosystem, including all developer tools and crypto infrastructure known by EVM developers from Ethereum, Polygon, BNB, Avalanche, and others. <a href="https://docs.coredao.org/developer/develop-on-core/building-on-core">Toolings</a> include Remix, Hardhat, Solidity, Truffle, ethers.js, and more. Infrastructure includes MetaMask, token standards (e.g., ERC-721 or ERC-20), blockchain scanners, smart contracts, and connections to middleware such as IPFS.</p><p>Electric Capital’s 2023 developer report highlights both EVM dominance and developer interest in the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. Most notably:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.developerreport.com/developer-report?s=87-of-multi-chain-devs-work">87%</a> of multichain developers work on at least one EVM chain</li><li>Bitcoin and Ethereum account for <a href="https://www.developerreport.com/developer-report?s=bitcoin-and-ethereum-account-for">40%</a> of all crypto developers (not counting other EVM environments)</li><li><a href="https://www.developerreport.com/developer-report?s=40-of-all-bitcoin-open-source">40%</a> of all Bitcoin developers were focused on Bitcoin layers and scaling</li></ul><h3>coreBTC</h3><p>Core Chain has a BTC bridge enshrined into the protocol, which locks BTC on Bitcoin to mint coreBTC on Core Chain.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/57aead7a5516c642bfa4baa7f0b37fcf0d158013-1920x1080.png?w=800" /><p>The minting, securing, and burning of coreBTC operates as follows:</p><p>Minting coreBTC:</p><ul><li>A user sends BTC to a Locker's Bitcoin address</li><li>Porter monitors the Bitcoin blockchain and submits proof of transaction to the Core Chain smart contract</li><li>Smart contract verifies transaction via Bitcoin Light Client and mints equivalent coreBTC</li></ul><p>Protecting coreBTC:</p><ul><li>Lockers deposit overcollateralized assets as collateral</li><li>Liquidators monitor collateral ratios and force liquidation if collateral drops too low</li><li>Liquidators use coreBTC to buy Locker's tokens at discount, burning coreBTC</li><li>Guardians monitor Lockers for misbehavior like unauthorized transfers</li><li>Slash Locker's collateral as penalty, burning coreBTC equal to violation</li></ul><p>Burning coreBTC:</p><ul><li>User requests to burn coreBTC, specifying Bitcoin address</li><li>Smart contract burns coreBTC and alerts Locker</li><li>Locker sends equivalent BTC to user's address</li><li>Transaction verified by Bitcoin Light Client</li></ul><p>Key participants include:</p><ul><li>Users<ul><li>Send BTC to mint coreBTC</li><li>Request to burn coreBTC to redeem BTC</li></ul></li><li>Lockers<ul><li>Hold users' BTC on Bitcoin blockchain</li><li>Deposit overcollateralized assets as collateral</li><li>Send BTC to users redeeming coreBTC</li></ul></li><li>Porters<ul><li>Monitor Bitcoin blockchain for transactions to Lockers</li><li>Submit proof to Core Chain to initiate coreBTC minting</li></ul></li><li>Core Chain Smart Contracts<ul><li>Mint and burn coreBTC</li><li>Verify Bitcoin transactions via Light Client</li><li>Manage Locker collateral and slashing</li></ul></li><li>Bitcoin Light Client<ul><li>Verifies Bitcoin transactions for Core Chain</li></ul></li><li>Liquidators<ul><li>Monitor Lockers' collateral ratios</li><li>Force liquidation if collateral drops too low</li></ul></li><li>Guardians<ul><li>Monitor Lockers for misbehavior</li><li>Trigger slashing of Locker collateral for violations</li></ul></li><li>Slashers<ul><li>Can report Locker violations to trigger slashing</li><li>Rewarded with portion of slashed collateral</li></ul></li></ul><h2>The CORE Token</h2><p>The CORE token is used for transaction fees, staking (and mining) rewards, and governance. It has a total supply of 2.1 billion, to be distributed through block rewards over 81 years. CORE also has a minor deflationary mechanism, as it can burn excess rewards for relayers and verifiers.</p><p>The development of Core Chain was entirely self-funded. CORE’s total supply of 2.1 billion is <a href="https://medium.com/@core_dao/the-3d-blockchain-an-introduction-to-cores-distribution-and-tokenomics-c6e987ca5ae7">distributed</a> between contributors, users, miners, reserves, treasury, and relayer rewards.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/b3b8e9d2e4256f8aaf8bb9ac9bf0a15639532a8e-1280x720.png?w=800" /><h3>Governance</h3><p>Governance of Core DAO, managed through the CORE token, is in Stage 1.5, with Stage 3 being the end goal for decentralization. Changes to Core Chain are proposed through Core Improvement Proposals (CIPs) and can be proposed by any member of the community.</p><h4>Stage 1: Offchain Governance</h4><p>Proposals are made offchain and are passed with a majority vote. The voting period is seven days.</p><h4>Stage 2: Partial Onchain Governance</h4><p>If passed, the next stage of governance would allow changing fixed parameters with onchain voting. The m Parameter is already subject to governance, but this would extend it to other variables, such as the percentage of burned fees (currently 0%). There are also discussions around adding time delays to discourage vote selling.</p><h4>Stage 3: Full Onchain Governance</h4><p>This Stage is not fully fleshed out and is in development by the community. Ideas include requiring collateral to post proposals.</p><h2>State of the Core Ecosystem</h2><p>Many protocols in Core Chain’s ecosystem are focused on BTC and BTC derivatives (i.e., Bitcoin-native assets based on BTC such as Ordinals NFTs). BTC is largely an underutilized asset, as the limited programmability of Bitcoin Script makes it challenging to activate BTC in conventional DeFi protocols while maintaining custody of the asset(s). With a consensus mechanism integrated with Bitcoin’s own consensus, Core Chain aims to provide a DeFi environment for protocols to utilize BTC assets with minimal trust assumptions. <a href="https://coredao.org/explore/blog/63">Core Ignition</a> is a six-month incentive program intended to catalyze more growth around Bitcoin DeFi.</p><p>Notable native projects already on Core Chain include:</p><ul><li><a href="https://glyph.exchange/">Glyph</a> — a DEX and liquidity hub</li><li>Colend — a borrowing and lending protocol</li><li><a href="https://nlx.trade/">NLX</a> — a perps DEX</li><li>Spiritdex — a Uniswap V4 style DEX</li><li><a href="https://wizardgallery.xyz/">WizardNFT</a> — an NFT marketplace for Core NFTs and bridged Bitcoin Ordinals</li><li>CoreX — a social DEX</li><li><a href="https://www.pinksale.finance/">Pinksale</a> — a launchpad</li><li>Element Wallet — a Core-native mobile app with built-in chat and wallet features, designed to be the end-to-end interface for Core Chain users.</li><li>Satoshi App — a mobile application designed for Core ecosystem airdrops, enabling users to earn tokens of protocols launching on Core Chain.</li><li><a href="https://bitstable.finance/">BitStable</a> — a stablecoin issuers that takes both BTC assets and Ethereum assets as collateral</li></ul><p>As discussed in the Technology section, Core Chain has an enshrined BTC bridge, but it also has connections with third-party bridges to interop with other ecosystems:</p><ul><li><a href="https://docs.coredao.org/developer/develop-on-core/bridging-with-core/bridging-tokens-to-core-with-layerzero">LayerZero</a> — a bridging integration that connects Core Chain to Avalanche, BNB, Arbitrum, Polygon, and other networks</li><li><a href="https://coredao.org/explore/blog/65">Multibit</a> — a BRC-20 focused bridge connecting Core Chain to Ethereum, BNB, and Bitcoin</li></ul><p>Core Chain also features cross-chain dapps and infrastructure that have originated in other ecosystems, including:</p><ul><li><a href="https://medium.com/@core_dao/introducing-pyth-network-cores-latest-infrastructure-integration-07f0c5909408?source=user_profile---------14----------------------------">Pyth</a> — an oracles service</li><li><a href="https://medium.com/@core_dao/core-is-now-supported-by-ankr-rpc-f522f108cbd0?source=user_profile---------15----------------------------https://medium.com/@core_dao/core-is-now-supported-by-ankr-rpc-f522f108cbd0?source=user_profile---------15----------------------------">Ankr</a> — an RPC service</li><li><a href="https://icecreamswap.com/?chain=core">IceCreamSwap</a> and SushiSwap — DEXs</li></ul><p>Upcoming Core ecosystems projects include</p><ul><li>NLX — a perpetuals DEX</li><li>A launchpad and DEX for bridged Ordinals (NFTs and BRC20s)</li></ul><h2>Competitive Landscape</h2><p>Bitcoin layers have proliferated dramatically since the start of 2023. A space that previously only consisted of a handful of state channels, client-side validated (CSV) networks, and sidechains, is now home to over <a href="https://www.bitcoinlayers.org/">40 projects</a>, although most are still in development.</p><p>The leading incumbents include Stacks, Rootstock, Liquid, and Lightning Network. Core Chain’s EVM-compatible, sidechain model is</p><ul><li>Similar to Stacks in that they’re both sidechains. Both networks’ consensus adaptations (Stacks’ Stacking and Core Chain’s Satoshi Plus) rely on not only Bitcoin miners but also a PoS component for added security. Stacks uses the Clarity execution environment, which does not a community as robust as the EVM one.</li><li>Similar to Rootstock in that they’re both sidechains. Both networks’ execution environments are the EVM. Rootstock uses direct merge-mining without any PoS component, unlike Core Chain’s Satoshi Plus consensus, which includes a PoS component.</li><li>Similar to Liquid in that they’re sidechains. Liquid is more limited in functionality, unlike the Turing-complete EVM execution environment of Core Chain. Liquid operates as a federation, as opposed to the open network that is Core Chain.</li><li>Unlike Lightning Network, which is a state channel. Lightning offers no added functionality (other than scaling), unlike the Turing-complete EVM execution environment of Core Chain. Lightning does not require any additional trust assumptions (i.e., users can unilaterally exit from a channel after a challenge period). Unlike Core Chain’s Satoshi Plus consensus, it places trust in Core nodes for duties such as consensus and transaction integrity.</li></ul><p>More recently, newer layers have emerged, such as BOB, Citrea, Bison, and more. Several of these entrants are leveraging the EVM as they explore the development of rollups. Currently, rollups cannot exist on Bitcoin due to technical limitations. However, this could change in a few years time, building on innovations such as BitVM to support the key features needed to be considered a rollup:</p><ul><li>Enforcing the validity of rollup transactions on Bitcoin L1 with validity or fraud proofs. With fraud proofs, it a rollup would require a permissionless and open set of challengers rather than a federated set like many of today’s BitVM-based models propos).</li><li>Storing necessary calldata on Bitcoin to recreate the rollup’s state.</li><li>BTC bridging with minimal trust assumptions, allowing for unilateral exits from the rollup back to Bitcoin L1.</li></ul><p>Many existing sidechains will likely reduce their trust assumptions and gravitate towards rollup models as the tech becomes available. Also, many of the upcoming rollups will initially launch as sidechains. This would be a similar route compared to the gradual development of Ethereum L2s, which ran in production for years before nearly any of them had working proofs (fraud or validity) to enforce transaction validity.</p><h2>Roadmap</h2><p>Core has a series of development plans on its roadmap:</p><ul><li>Non-custodial BTC Staking: A third component of Satoshi Plus, any BTC holder can use absolute time-locks to delegate their Bitcoin to Core validators in exchange for token rewards, all without giving up custody of their private keys.</li><li>Local fee markets: These can make transactions more predictable and potentially cheaper.</li><li>Atomic swaps: Leveraging HTLCs, atomic swaps could be used for general purposes.</li><li>coreBTC improvements: Integrating coreBTC with Core Chain’s Satoshi Plus consensus and using multisig wallets can increase the security of the asset. Additionally, Lockers could be given more collateral options.</li><li>coreBTC as a gas token: This would allow users to pay for transaction fees in either CORE or coreBTC and would enable users to interact with the ecosystem without using any other asset than BTC.</li><li>Bitcoin LST: This would allow BTC stakers to earn yield on their BTC while also using that BTC for various applications on Core Chain.</li><li>Restaking: This would enable other protocols to benefit from Core Chain’s Bitcoin protection.</li></ul><h2>Closing Summary</h2><p>The number of Bitcoin layers has exploded over the past six months, with renewed optimism for Bitcoin programmability. Core Foundation was one of several teams already building in the Bitcoin ecosystem for years, finding themselves greatly positioned to capitalize on the momentum of Bitcoin layers.</p><p>Core Chain is a scaling and programmability solution for Bitcoin that is differentiated by its Satoshi Plus consensus, EVM execution environment, Core DAO governance, and coreBTC bridge. The Core Chain community is building an ecosystem of Bitcoin-focused applications, leveraging Bitcoin security wherever possible along the way. In the coming months, Core Chain plans to iterate towards its governance role and catalyze more ecosystem development with incentives programs.</p></div>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章探讨了意图驱动交易的前景，为用户提供增强的互操作性、全球流动性访问和MEV捕获。尽管以太坊协议已经采纳了意图驱动架构，但它们存在于孤立的系统中，强调了最大化意图系统优势的需要。虽然意图架构协议不断发展，但中心化拍卖预计会持续存在，直到去中心化设计出现。此外，转向基于意图的系统引入了替代的货币化途径，赋予意图架构层和用户重要的定价权，预计市场机会达220亿美元，意图架构层由于其适度的定价权和交易量聚合能力而成为主要受益者。 <div>
<p>Explore the promising realm of intent-based transactions, offering users enhanced interoperability, global liquidity access, and MEV capture. While Ethereum protocols have embraced intent-based architectures, their existence within siloed systems underscores the need for a new approach to maximize intent system benefits. Despite ongoing development of intent architecture protocols, centralized auctions are expected to persist until decentralized designs emerge. Additionally, the transition to intent-based systems introduces alternative monetization avenues, empowering intent architecture layers and users with significant pricing power, while presenting a $22 billion market opportunity across spot trading, perpetual protocols, and bridging verticals, with intent architecture layers poised as the primary beneficiary due to their moderate pricing power and volume aggregation capabilities.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章深入探讨了memecoin在加密市场循环中的作用，强调其可预测的行为和爆炸性回报。它将memecoin定位为传统观念之外的后期投机资产，探讨了基于启发式的投资策略明显优于基于市值加权的智能合约平台。通过跟踪memecoin市值阈值，该策略在memecoin、智能合约和现金之间分配资金，展示了显著的回报。然而，文章也承认memecoin领域的不断发展，增加了其流行性，挑战了历史模式的可预测性，并强调memecoin投资的灵活性的必要性。 <div>
<p>The article delves into the role of memecoins in the crypto market cycles, emphasizing their predictable behavior and explosive returns. Highlighting memecoins' position as a later-stage speculative asset beyond traditional sensibilities, it explores a heuristic-based investment strategy outperforming market-cap-weighted smart contract platforms significantly. By tracking memecoin market cap thresholds, the strategy shifts allocations between memecoins, smart contracts, and cash, showcasing remarkable returns. However, the article also acknowledges the evolving landscape of memecoins, with increased popularity challenging the predictability of historical patterns and emphasizing the necessity for adaptability in memecoin investments.</p>

<div><h2>Key Insights</h2><ul><li><strong>Hedera DeFi TVL is up 146% YTD to $157 million. </strong>DeFi TVL denominated in HBAR is also up 89% YTD, implying that the TVL increase was in part due to capital inflows.</li><li><strong>SaucerSwap’s V2 launch in November 2023 has helped the DEX achieve impressive growth,</strong> with SAUCE price ($0.21), TVL ($150 million), and average daily trading volume ($5 million) all hitting all-time highs in 2024.</li><li><strong>Stablecoin market cap has continued to increase in 2024 after a strong Q4.</strong> The supply of USDC on Hedera is up 27% YTD to $8 million.</li><li><strong>Stader liquid staking TVL on Hedera has been decreasing in 2024</strong>, down 11% YTD from 378.6 million HBAR to 338.1 million.</li></ul><h2>Primer</h2><p><a href="https://messari.io/project/hedera-hashgraph">Hedera (HBAR)</a> is an open-source, public-permissioned Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain network. It is governed by 30 global organizations, known as the <a href="https://hedera.com/council">Hedera Council</a>, with input on the network’s features and ecosystem standards from the community via <a href="https://hips.hedera.com/">Hedera Improvement Proposals (HIPs)</a>.</p><p>The Hedera Network offers an optimized version of the Besu EVM for smart contracts (Hedera Smart Contract Service), alongside a native tokenization service (Hedera Token Service) and high-throughput data writing and verification service (Hedera Consensus Service). These services are known as the <a href="https://hedera.com/how-it-works">Hedera Network Services</a>, which developers can use to build decentralized applications. The network is powered by the <a href="https://docs.hedera.com/guides/core-concepts/hashgraph-consensus-algorithms">Hashgraph Consensus Algorithm</a>, which delivers high throughput, fair ordering, and low-latency consensus for all transactions. The combination of the Hedera Network Services and Hedera’s high speed and cheap transactions makes Hedera an optimal solution for DeFi applications. This report will focus on Hedera’s growing DeFi ecosystem and highlight its key developments and metrics.</p><p><a href="https://docs.hedera.com/guides/core-concepts/hashgraph-consensus-algorithms">Website</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/hedera">X (Twitter)</a> / <a href="https://hedera.com/discord">Discord</a></p><h2>DeFi Overview</h2><h3>Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)</h3><h4>SaucerSwap</h4><p><a href="https://www.saucerswap.finance/">SaucerSwap</a> is the largest native DEX on Hedera. The SaucerSwap DEX utilizes an automated market-making (<a href="https://docs.saucerswap.finance/get-started/faq#what-is-an-amm">AMM</a>) architecture where token-based liquidity pools facilitate liquidity for trades. SaucerSwap consists of two different protocols: SaucerSwap V1 and V2.</p><p><strong>SaucerSwap V1</strong></p><p><a href="https://docs.saucerswap.finance/protocol/saucerswap-v1">SaucerSwap V1</a> is an AMM <a href="https://www.saucerswap.finance/whitepaper.pdf">forked</a> from Uniswap V2 and modified to interact with the Hedera Token Service (<a href="https://hedera.com/token-service">HTS</a>) through the Hedera Smart Contract Service (<a href="https://hedera.com/smart-contract">HSCS</a>). Uniswap V2-based AMMs are liquidity pools that consist of two cryptoassets. As the two cryptoassets enter and leave the pool, the price of the assets against one another constantly rebalances. </p><p>This price is determined by the formula: </p><p><em>x * y = k</em></p><p>“<em>x</em>”<em> </em>and “<em>y</em>”<em> </em>signify tokens in a liquidity pool, and “<em>k</em>” is the product of the token reserves. </p><p>All swaps routed through V1 liquidity pools <a href="https://docs.saucerswap.finance/protocol/saucerswap-v1">incur</a> a 0.3% fee. Then, ⅚ of the fee is directed towards the pool’s liquidity providers pro-rata, and the remaining ⅙ is directed to the protocol.</p><p>Upon depositing assets into a V1 liquidity pool, users <a href="https://docs.saucerswap.finance/protocol/saucerswap-v1#yield-farm">receive</a> liquidity pool tokens in return. These LP tokens can then be <a href="https://docs.saucerswap.finance/protocol/saucerswap-v1#yield-farm">staked</a> to earn yield farming rewards in both HBAR and SAUCE. Rewards emissions are <a href="https://docs.saucerswap.finance/governance/overview#saucerswap-dao">determined</a> by SaucerSwap DAO.&nbsp; </p><p><strong>SaucerSwap V2</strong></p><p><a href="https://docs.saucerswap.finance/protocol/saucerswap-v2">SaucerSwap V2</a> is a concentrated liquidity AMM <a href="https://docs.saucerswap.finance/protocol/saucerswap-v2#core-concepts">forked</a> from Uniswap V3 and modified to interact with the Hedera Token Service (<a href="https://hedera.com/token-service">HTS</a>) through the Hedera Smart Contract Service (<a href="https://hedera.com/smart-contract">HSCS</a>). Concentrated liquidity AMMs aim to improve various inefficiencies of traditional V2 AMMs. For AMMs that use the “(<em>x)(y) = k</em>” formula, the AMM provides liquidity at all price points from zero to infinity. This ensures that liquidity can be provided at every possible price point, but it also creates inefficiencies as less liquidity is provided at each given price point.</p><p>For example, assuming the price of HBAR is $0.10, a traditional AMM provides the same amount of liquidity at “HBAR = $0.01” or “HBAR = $1.00 million,” despite X only being $100.00. Since the likelihood of X increasing or decreasing 100x in a short period is very low, a large portion of the liquidity goes unused.</p><p>The concentrated liquidity model innovates upon this by allowing users to <a href="https://docs.saucerswap.finance/protocol/saucerswap-v2#concentrated-liquidity">choose</a> which prices to provide liquidity at through price ranges. V2 liquidity positions only <a href="https://docs.saucerswap.finance/protocol/saucerswap-v2#concentrated-liquidity">provide</a> liquidity, based on the formula <em>“(x)(y) = k,” </em>within the boundaries designated by a user’s chosen price range. </p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/3dcc725df805552642e22bec18000ea8557b9604-1345x497.png?w=800" /><p><em>Source: </em><a href="https://uniswap.org/whitepaper-v3.pdf">Uniswap V3 Core Whitepaper</a></p><p>Swaps routed through V2 liquidity pools <a href="https://docs.saucerswap.finance/protocol/saucerswap-v2#fee-tiers">incur</a> a fee ranging from 0.05% to 1%, depending on the liquidity pool.

V2 liquidity providers are eligible to receive rewards from the <a href="https://docs.saucerswap.finance/protocol/saucerswap-v2#liquidity-aligned-reward-initiative-lari">Liquidity-Aligned Reward Initiative (LARI)</a>. Any HTS token can be distributed as rewards through this initiative, and liquidity providers receive rewards based on the volume routed through their liquidity positions. </p><p>The <a href="https://hashscan.io/mainnet/token/0.0.731861">SAUCE</a> token is an HTS token on Hedera with a maximum token supply of 1 billion.

SAUCE tokens will serve as voting power in <a href="https://docs.saucerswap.finance/governance/overview#saucerswap-dao">SauceSwap DAO</a> in the future. SAUCE is also used for both liquidity provision <a href="https://docs.saucerswap.finance/tokenomics/overview#sauce-token">rewards</a> (Yield Farming and LARI) and can be <a href="https://docs.saucerswap.finance/tokenomics/overview#sauce-token">staked</a> as xSAUCE. xSAUCE is a rebasing token that earns <a href="https://docs.saucerswap.finance/protocol/single-sided-staking">rewards</a> from the following sources:</p><ul><li>⅙ of swap fees collected from both V1 and V2 liquidity pools.</li><li>30% of farming emissions</li><li>HBAR native staked rewards from WHBAR’s underlying HBAR balance.</li></ul><h4>Heliswap</h4><p><a href="https://www.heliswap.io/">Heliswap</a> is another native DEX on Hedera. Similarly to SaucerSwap, Heliswap utilizes an automated market-making (<a href="https://docs.heliswap.io/features#liquidity-pools">AMM</a>) architecture where token-based liquidity pools facilitate liquidity for trades. As of writing, Heliswap’s V1 AMM is <a href="https://docs.heliswap.io/#about-heliswap">forked</a> from Uniswap V2, but a V2 version of Heliswap is on the <a href="https://docs.heliswap.io/roadmap#heliswap-v2">roadmap</a>.</p><p>All swaps routed through V1 liquidity pools <a href="https://docs.heliswap.io/features/lp-tokens-and-rewards">incur</a> a 0.3% fee. The entire fee is <a href="https://docs.heliswap.io/features/lp-tokens-and-rewards">directed</a> to Heliswap’s liquidity providers. Upon depositing assets into a V1 liquidity pool, users <a href="https://docs.heliswap.io/features/lp-tokens-and-rewards">receive</a> liquidity pool tokens in return. These LP tokens can then be <a href="https://app.heliswap.io/farms">staked</a> to earn yield farming rewards in both HBAR and HELI.</p><p>The <a href="https://docs.heliswap.io/tokenomics/usdheli-token">HELI</a> token is an HTS token on Hedera with a maximum token supply of 888.89 million tokens. HELI <a href="https://docs.heliswap.io/tokenomics/token-allocation">allocations</a> are as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Ecosystem Rewards</strong>: 311.11 million (35% of the maximum token supply)</li><li><strong>Team &amp; Advisors</strong>: 177.78 million (20% of the maximum token supply)</li><li><strong>Ecosystem Development</strong>: 133.33 million (15% of the maximum token supply)</li><li><strong>DAO Pool</strong>: 88.89 million (10% of the maximum token supply)</li><li><strong>Grants</strong>: 66.67 million (7.5% of the maximum token supply)</li><li><strong>Council Treasury</strong>: 66.67 million (7.5% of the maximum token supply)</li><li><strong>Token Drops</strong>: 44.44 million (5% of the maximum token supply)</li></ul><p>The core utility of HELI is <a href="https://docs.heliswap.io/tokenomics/usdheli-token#governance">governance</a>. HELI tokenholders can both <a href="https://docs.heliswap.io/governance#who-can-make-a-proposal">create</a> governance proposals and vote on them. HELI is also used for liquidity provision <a href="https://app.heliswap.io/farms">rewards</a> and can be <a href="https://docs.heliswap.io/single-sided-staking-phase-2">staked</a> in a single-sided staking pool.</p><h3>Liquid Staking</h3><h4>Stader</h4><p><a href="https://www.staderlabs.com/">Stader</a> is a liquid staking provider that offers support for Hedera. As of writing, Stader is the only provider of liquid staking on the Hedera network. Users can <a href="https://www.staderlabs.com/hedera/">stake</a> HBAR with Stader and receive <a href="https://www.staderlabs.com/docs-v1/hedera/HBARX">HBARX</a> in return. HBARX is a liquid staking token that <a href="https://www.staderlabs.com/docs-v1/hedera/HBARX#what-is-hbarx">represents</a> a user’s share of Stader’s staking pool. This approach allows users to access the benefits of staking without having to indefinitely lock up token holdings.</p><p>Additionally, HBARX rebases to reflect accumulated staking rewards. As such, the exchange rate between HBAR and HBARX increases as Stader accumulates staking rewards. Furthermore, Stader charges a 10% fee on staking rewards to cover the costs associated with operating the staking service. Users can unstake HBARX for the underlying staked HBAR and any accrued rewards at any time, but they must wait one day to withdraw.</p><h3>Services</h3><h4>DaVinciGraph</h4><p><a href="https://davincigraph.io/">DaVinciGraph</a> is a token management service on Hedera that allows projects to streamline onchain management services related to tokens.

Additionally, the TVL denominated in HBAR also increased to 1.4 billion, an increase of 89% YTD. This suggests that Hedera’s TVL increase was not only driven by an increase in the price of HBAR (+24% YTD) but also by capital inflows.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/29fab6bfe556ea678b8ba31c12ba29a0f2bf9843-720x405.png?w=800" /><p>Furthermore, SaucerSwap has further solidified its dominance within the Hedera network ecosystem, increasing its TVL YTD from $60.4 million to $143.8 million (+138% YTD) and accounting for 98% of the network's total TVL. SaucerSwap's <a href="https://medium.com/@SaucerSwap/saucerswap-v2-launch-details-f6d4244e27c7">launch</a> of SaucerSwap V2 in November brought new features and improvements, including concentrated liquidity, MetaMask support, Tokenomics V2, and the Liquidity-Aligned Reward Initiative (LARI). As for Heliswap and Pangolin, their respective TVLs have decreased by 18% and 4% YTD.</p><p>DeFi Diversity measures the number of protocols that constitute the top 90% of DeFi TVL. A greater distribution of TVL across protocols reduces the risk of widespread ecosystem contagion resulting from adverse events like exploits or protocol migrations. Due to the dominance of SaucerSwap, Hedera’s DeFi diversity remains at 1.</p><h3>Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)</h3><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/2db30b0a0d07876f949d9540578cad0459932049-720x405.png?w=800" /><p>DEX volumes on Hedera continue hitting new highs in 2024, after setting an all-time high in Q4 of 2023. Led by SaucerSwap, daily average DEX volume is up to $5.2 million. This is 308% higher than Q4’s daily average DEX volume of $1.3 million. Throughout 2024, SaucerSwap has accounted for 99% of DEX volume on Hedera.</p><h4>SaucerSwap</h4><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/b1410a4d1825aad516f8c2257f005969c257cf24-720x405.png?w=800" /><p>On November 17, 2023, SaucerSwap V2 was <a href="https://medium.com/@SaucerSwap/saucerswap-v2-launch-details-f6d4244e27c7">launched</a>.

This enables 4,000x more capital efficiency as opposed to SaucerSwap V1.</li><li><strong>Revamped Web-App</strong> - A completely re-desgined web app to interact with the protocol and both V1 and V2 pools.</li><li><strong>MetaMask Support</strong> - Full integration with MetaMask to allow any user with a MetaMask wallet to interact with the protocol.</li><li><strong>Update Tokenomics Model</strong> - A 60% reduction in SAUCE token inflation to 126.84 SAUCE per minute accordingly:<ul><li>V1 Yield Farms - 59.82 SAUCE per minute</li><li>DAO + LARI - 55.49 SAUCE per minute</li><li>Developers - 11.53 SAUCE per minute</li></ul></li><li><strong>Liquidity-Aligned Reward Initiative (LARI)</strong> - SAUCE token rewards for V2 liquidity providers. </li></ul><p>The success of V2 is reflected in both SaucerSwap’s TVL and the price of SAUCE. On November 17, 2023, SaucerSwap TVL was $36.2 million. By the end of December, TVL had nearly doubled to $62.4 million, and by the end of February, TVL was $149.9 million, a 314% increase since SaucerSwap V2 went live. Similarly, the price of SAUCE also increased after V2. By the end of February, SAUCE was $0.21, an 824% increase from its November 17 price of $0.02.</p><p>The V1 pools with the highest <a href="https://www.saucerswap.finance/liquidity">liquidity</a> include:</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.saucerswap.finance/liquidity/0.0.1463739">HBARX/HBAR</a> - $21.8 million</li><li><a href="https://www.saucerswap.finance/liquidity/0.0.1461945">SAUCE/HBAR</a> - $15.1 million</li><li><a href="https://www.saucerswap.finance/liquidity/0.0.1465865">SAUCE/xSAUCE</a> - $5.3 million</li><li><a href="https://www.saucerswap.finance/liquidity/0.0.1462797">USDC/HBAR</a> - $2.6 million</li><li><a href="https://www.saucerswap.finance/liquidity/0.0.1465211">HBAR/xSAUCE</a> - $2.4 million</li></ol><p>The V2 pools with the highest liquidity include:</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.saucerswap.finance/liquidity/0.0.3964790">SAUCE/xSAUCE</a> - $7.1 million</li><li><a href="https://www.saucerswap.finance/liquidity/0.0.3961531">HBARX/HBAR</a> - $3.8 million</li><li><a href="https://www.saucerswap.finance/liquidity/0.0.3951117">SAUCE/HBAR</a> - $2.9 million</li><li><a href="https://www.saucerswap.finance/liquidity/0.0.3964804">USDC/HBAR</a> - $1.4 million</li><li><a href="https://www.saucerswap.finance/liquidity/0.0.3948521">USDC/USDC (HTS)</a> - $0.8 million</li></ol><p>These ten pools represent 42% of SaucerSwap’s TVL. However, with the addition of concentrated liquidity, the absolute number of TVL does not necessarily dictate the liquidity of a DEX. An additional way to measure liquidity is through price impact on swaps. As of writing, a $100,000 swap of HBAR (769,946 HBAR) to USDC has a price impact of -2.47%. As for SAUCE, a $100,000 swap of SAUCE (521,342 SAUCE) to USDC has a price impact of -2.78%.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/a9319e4299591ba5004bbbd02b96c607e848020e-720x405.png?w=800" /><p>The success of V2 can be further explained through SaucerSwap’s DEX volumes, broken down by V1 and V2 volumes. In every month except January, V2 volumes outperformed V1. In December, V2 volumes were over three times higher than V1. However, V2’s best month came in February, when it set a monthly high of $123.3 million in DEX volume.</p><p>By the end of February, 52% of the supply of SAUCE had been staked as xSAUCE. Moreover, the exchange rate between SAUCE and xSAUCE is 1.1362:1, and xSAUCE stakers are receiving an approximate APR of 3.6%.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/6f4e540abf0928cfbb2b89b8cf2f422dee3423df-720x405.png?w=800" /><p>SaucerSwap has seen a healthy increase in both transactions and active addresses in 2024. In 2024, there has been an average of 12,300 daily transactions and 1,600 daily active addresses. Respectively, this is a 235% (3,700 daily transactions) and 186% (600 daily active addresses) increase compared to Q4 of 2023.</p><h3>Stablecoins</h3><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/96690185a6a4dd227dcd5305bb409a63bea21414-720x405.png?w=800" /><p>The only stablecoin that has been natively deployed on the Hedera Network is USDC. USDC has built on its strong Q4 and is up 35% YTD to a market cap of $8.3 million. Furthermore, a significant portion of this USDC is being used in Hedera’s DeFi ecosystem. $3.1 million USDC (37% of Hedera’s USDC supply) is deposited into SaucerSwap liquidity pools. Additionally, <a href="https://hashscan.io/mainnet/token/0.0.1055472">USDT</a> and <a href="https://www.saucerswap.finance/swap/HBAR/0.0.1055477">DAI</a> have each been bridged to Hedera using Hashport. $282,200 USDT and $104,900 DAI have been deposited into SaucerSwap liquidity pools.&nbsp;</p><h3>Liquid Staking</h3><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/7b76098e861f108e84d5f59667fae4774f2edcaa-720x405.png?w=800" /><p>Liquid staking is not included in the TVL figure. Despite this, it remains a relevant metric with growing significance. Stader is the only provider of liquid staking on the Hedera network. Liquid staking TVL in HBAR peaked in Q1 2023 and has been on a gradual decline since. Declines in Liquid staking TVL have continued in 2024 and are down 25% YTD to 338.1 million HBAR. Furthermore, liquid staking as a % of total staked for rewards has been steadily decreasing in 2024, down 25% YTD to 4.5% of all HBAR staked for rewards.</p><h3>Services</h3></div>

Building a well-balanced and diversified portfolio typically requires a significant time investment in order to understand and navigate the crypto world. Instead, many users opt for momentum-based trading strategies, as seen in the recent <a href="https://messari.io/report/memecoin-escape-velocity">memecoin craze</a>. For better or for worse, this style of trading could easily turn into a default for new traders, as opposed to strategies that are more anchored in fundamentals. As a result, this environment of extreme highs and lows can present a challenge for traders seeking to gain exposure to the fast-growing crypto sector. Rather than trying to “find the needle in the haystack,” some investors might prefer John Bogle’s approach of simply “<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/920319-don-t-look-for-the-needle-in-the-haystack-just-buy">buying the haystack</a>” itself.</p><p>The strategy is exceedingly popular in the traditional finance world, with global exchange-traded fund (ETF) assets <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/224579/worldwide-etf-assets-under-management-since-1997/">approaching $10 trillion</a>. This strategy has proven to be favorable for investors, as it allows for building a well-balanced and diversified portfolio without the significant time investment. In the crypto world, there has been significant interest in the recently approved <a href="https://messari.io/report/btc-etf-positioning">Bitcoin ETF</a>, demonstrating plenty of traditional and crypto-native demand for this sort of financial product.</p><p>In an attempt to meet this demand, among others, Cryptex has focused its efforts and developments around a single goal: making untradeable markets tradeable. For those seeking to buy the haystack, Cryptex offers the Total Market Cap (TCAP) token which tracks the entire cryptocurrency market cap. This approach effectively unlocks a previously untradeable market and simplifies the investment process in the complex world of cryptocurrencies. In addition, Cryptex has managed to provide TCAP and other offerings without venture capital money or an initial coin offering. Instead, Cryptex stays true to the crypto ethos by providing unique products that are owned and developed by the DAO and protocol.</p><h2>Background</h2><p>Cryptex (<a href="https://messari.io/project/cryptex">CTX</a>) was launched on April 8, 2021, with the goal of making crypto-native markets tradeable. Unlike many of its peers, Cryptex’s launch did not involve any venture capital money or initial coin offerings and was instead a fair launch. The <a href="https://cryptexfinance.notion.site/Meet-Our-Founders-c714ad85176b4773b1001c5a8e4420e5">story</a> began with co-founder <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/JoeCryptex">Joe Sticco</a>’s vision to create the S&amp;P 500 of crypto. He worked with co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-matzner-86aa0719">Thomas Matzner</a> to bring the idea to life with the help of Ethereum developer <a href="https://twitter.com/preston_vanloon">Preston Van Loon</a>. Formerly at Google, Van Loon also helped establish Prysmatic Labs and worked on Ethereum's shift to Proof-of-Stake (PoS). Since launching, Cryptex has gone through several iterations, including <a href="https://v1.cryptex.finance/">Cryptex V1</a>, <a href="https://docs.cryptex.finance/v2/overview">Cryptex V2</a>, and <a href="https://docs.cryptex.finance/pi/intro">Cryptex π</a>.</p><p>Cryptex uses Ethereum smart contracts, Perennial derivatives vaults, and Chainlink/Pyth data oracles to provide a unique trading experience for users on the Arbitrum Network. The protocol’s flagship product, the TCAP token, tracks crypto’s total market cap and functions similarly to an index fund. Cryptex offers several other innovative products such as its squared markets or its curated basket funds. Cryptex operates as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) where decision-making is in the hands of CTX tokenholders. The CTX token came into existence via a fair launch, establishing a foundation of transparency and community-driven governance. CTX tokenholders have the authority to cast votes on a range of governance matters, including the introduction of proposals, the implementation of system upgrades, and the strategic management of the treasury.</p><h2>Technology</h2><p>In its endeavor to enable the trading of previously untradeable markets, Cryptex has gone through several iterations: Cryptex V1, Cryptex V2, and Cryptex π. While the underlying goals remained the same, the means to achieving these ends varied significantly enough to merit a deep dive into the technology.</p><h3>Cryptex V1</h3><p>On April 8, 2021, the Cryptex team launched <a href="https://v1.cryptex.finance/">Cryptex V1</a>. It introduced its inaugural product TCAP, which followed crypto’s total market cap. To track this metric via a price feed mechanism, Cryptex collaborated with Chainlink. Chainlink’s <a href="https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds#price-feeds">Price Feeds</a> aggregated data from four distinct providers and provided the average value onchain for TCAP contracts to access. The Chainlink oracles updated said data based on every 1% change in price. To mint TCAP, Cryptex employed a collateralized debt position (CDP) design. Its users first deposited collateral, such as ETH, DAI, or WBTC, and then received the overcollateralized synthetic asset TCAP in return. The value of TCAP was then a simple, index-fund-like calculation of crypto’s total market cap divided by 10 billion (e.g., at the time of writing, TCAP is worth $259.10, reflecting a total market cap of $2.59 trillion).</p><p>Cryptex Finance encountered some challenges with the CDP design, which was integral to keeping TCAP close to its peg. Due to the oracle and token price's dynamic nature, the peg was difficult to maintain because it depended on market behavior.</p><p>To better engage with its community, Cryptex Finance introduced governance through its governance token <a href="https://messari.io/project/cryptex">CTX</a>. With listings on several exchanges such as Gemini, Holbi, and Coinbase, users were given the ability to vote on protocol upgrades. However, the peg problem still posed a challenge for the platform, leading the team to innovate towards better methods of maintaining the token’s stability. Despite these issues, TCAP still saw about $200 million exchanged in mints and burns during Cryptex V1. The fees generated from burning TCAP (equal to 1%) are all owned by the DAO.<br /></p><h3>Cryptex V2<br /></h3><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/65c1cd59f87b46e11d178b5d7aa8aeb6b81ad251-1829x1164.png?w=800" /><p></p><p>The Cryptex team <a href="https://medium.com/cryptexfinance/cryptex-finance-unveils-cryptex-v2-a-revolution-in-decentralized-perpetual-markets-powered-by-908496702812">launched V2</a> in June 2023. Its most notable change was moving from a CDP design to a perps-based approach that was fully decentralized. In addition to Chainlink oracles, the protocol’s <a href="https://docs.cryptex.finance/v2/architecture/">architecture</a> uses smart contracts on Ethereum, derivatives vaults on Perennial, and additional data oracles from Pyth. These all work together to provide a fully decentralized trading experience for users. Trading on <a href="https://v2.cryptex.finance/">Cryptex V2</a> is facilitated on the Arbitrum Network, which eventually led to an airdrop and <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/cryptexdao.eth/proposal/0xcb4fa1b0c56c7a381b44c7454696d58a2da26436e6af658c0679f8a4faf58a75">additional incentives</a> for V2.</p><p>Under Cryptex V2, the mechanisms behind TCAP are more robust, thanks to being built on the DeFi primitive <a href="https://perennial.finance/">Perennial</a>. The derivatives platform is a peers-to-pool automated market maker (AMM) that creates a two-sided market for traders and liquidity providers (LPs). At oracle price, LPs supply capital (acting as makers), and on the other side, traders can play the role of long/short takers.</p><p>There are two types of liquidity providers: passive, those who contribute to vaults that manage positions with baked-in hedging strategies; and active, those who choose to provide liquidity on one side of the market (long or short). LPs also have access to <a href="https://docs.cryptex.finance/v2/architecture#vaults">vaults</a>, which allow makers to hedge their positions. They use predetermined logic to manage these makers’ positions and then share the fees, profits, and losses with the makers. While these makers provide capital in the protocol, the takers (i.e., users) deposit their collateral to gain leveraged exposure to the Oracle price feeds. Trades are settled continuously with profits and losses distributed among participants according to their respective positions.</p><p>All of these trades are tracked by Perennial's collateral contract, which oversees the collateral deposited by users. Cryptex also utilizes Perennial’s product contracts as the core components holding the logic for the perpetual futures. However, the long and short positions are established as distinct instances of these product contracts.</p><p>Perennial's architecture introduces plenty of capital efficiency, as it directly matches up taker and maker trades. While Perennial does charge a variable <a href="https://docs.perennial.finance/protocol-design/funding-rate">funding rate</a> based on market usage, it is affordable when compared to platforms like GMX. Perennial also ensures that Cryptex trades can be executed with zero slippage since it is glued to oracle price points.<br /></p><h3>Cryptex π</h3><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/f6be799308e915e630404b2076a67e9bbaea4719-1931x1164.png?w=800" /><p></p><p>In the middle of Q4’23, the Cryptex team built upon V2’s features and launched <a href="https://cryptex.finance/blog/2023-11-29-introducing-pi/">Cryptex π</a>. The overall intentions of Cryptex π’s <a href="https://docs.cryptex.finance/pi/architecture">architecture</a> were to further increase capital efficiency and to incorporate more low-latency oracles like Pyth. As a result of these efforts, Cryptex was able to offer several <a href="https://cryptex.finance/#markets">additional markets</a>, including BTC-USD, ETH-USD, and SOL-USD. It also introduced squared markets for BTC and ETH, which allow for leveraged trading. Across <a href="https://cryptex.finance/#markets">these markets</a>, Cryptex has over $12 million in total liquidity and over $1 million in open interest. It incorporated several features and strategies to achieve these goals.</p><h4>Improving Capital Efficiency</h4><p>Rather than matching takers directly with LPs, Cryptex π first matches long takers with short takers and then turns to LPs to handle whatever’s left over. This system allows for a faster and more efficient user experience compared to V2. Also, Cryptex π uses bidirectional markets, e.g., one pool per market, as opposed to V2’s unidirectional market which uses one long and one short pool. On the technical side, Cryptex uses the “multi-invoker” feature. It serves as a smart contract that functions as a gateway to Perennial's smart contracts. Multi-invoker enables users or interfaces to execute several operations within Perennial with just one transaction.</p><p>The latest Cryptex version encourages more usage, which would ultimately improve efficiency, by introducing different order types such as stop losses, market, limits, and take profit. To enable these trades, Cryptex created another user type called “keepers.” In addition to executing these orders, keepers are responsible for verifying that price updates have been written onchain.</p><p>Cryptex π also addresses the potential friction caused by Perennial’s variable funding rate fee. Instead of relying on market usage, Cryptex π’s funding rate is determined by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional%E2%80%93integral%E2%80%93derivative_controller">PID mechanism</a>, which is one of the most well-established methods of employing feedback to establish control in a system.</p><h4>Low-Latency Oracles</h4><p>In addition to the Chainlink Core oracles, Cryptex π allows the protocol to expand and include low-latency oracles. As of writing, it has integrated with Pyth to attain these features. <a href="https://messari.io/report/understanding-pyth-network-a-comprehensive-overview">Pyth</a> is a robust oracle network that offers prices for cryptocurrencies, equities, foreign exchange pairs, ETFs, and commodities. It sources its data from several notable providers, including A few notable providers include Jane Street, Chicago Trading Company (CTC), Binance, and Galaxy. By tapping into this network, the Cryptex team has been able to get one step closer to realizing its goal of making untradeable markets tradeable.</p><h4>Fees</h4><p>Because Cryptex is built on Perennial, it inherits a dynamic fee structure. Perennial charges an exchange fee that varies depending on the <a href="https://docs.perennial.finance/protocol-design/funding-rate#market-skew">market skew</a> of each trade. Perennial levies three types of fees. Settlement fees are applied whenever a position is altered, aimed at offsetting the costs associated with oracle keeper fees. Taker fees are charged when opening or closing long/short positions. And, maker fees are charged when maker positions are opened or closed.</p><p>Cryptex π also introduced an interface fee, which is fixed at 2 basis points. The interface fee acts as compensation for simplifying the smart contract experience for users.</p><h2>Governance</h2><p>The history of Cryptex’s evolution from V1 to V2 to Cryptex π can be followed in the many <a href="https://forum.cryptex.finance/">community discussions</a> and proposals submitted to the Cryptex DAO. The DAO runs off of Cryptex’s native token CTX, which is further detailed in the Tokenomics section. The ability to submit proposals is limited to addresses that hold over 100,000 CTX ($515,000). For a proposal to pass, it then needs at least 400,000 CTX cast within 3 days and a simple majority.</p><p>After passing, the proposals are queued in the Timelock contract. This contract governs adjustments to system parameters, upgrades to logic, and contract modifications through a 'time-delayed, opt-out' mechanism. It uses a minimum of 2 days' notice for any governance action and 30 days for more significant changes like alterations to the risk system. All pending and executed actions are transparently visible on the <a href="https://www.tally.xyz/gov/cryptex">Timelock Dashboard</a>.</p><p>Although Cryptex governance is only on Ethereum Mainnet, the protocol has a bridge from Ethereum Mainnet to the Arbitrum Network through two primary contracts. First, the Arbitrum Message Relayer encodes and conveys proposal data to Arbitrum's delayed inbox, and second, the Arbitrum Message Executor subsequently executes the received calldata on the Arbitrum network.</p><p>The Cryptex DAO has a <a href="https://dune.com/cryptexfinance/cryptex-dao-dashboard">collection of data points</a> that highlight just how involved its community is. For example, the number of delegations is at an <a href="https://dune.com/queries/3046085/5066509">all-time high</a>, showing strong interest in the Crypt Keeper initiative (detailed below). The Cryptex team also stated that its core team doesn’t engage in staking in order to avoid double dipping.</p><h4>Single-Sided Staking</h4><p>CTX tokenholders have access to single-sided staking as another way to participate in Cryptex governance. By staking CTX, participants delegate their voting power to designated DAO representatives, known as Crypt Keepers, while still earning staking rewards. There is a 7-day lockup period during which withdrawals are not permitted. Rewards can be monitored via the Cryptex dApp or on platforms like <a href="http://zapper.fi">Zapper.fi</a>. Cryptex offers step-by-step guides on <a href="https://cryptexfinance.notion.site/How-to-make-yourself-a-Crypt-Keeper-112531ae15c14786abc5739217ca4ae7?pvs=25">how to delegate CTX</a> and <a href="https://cryptexfinance.notion.site/How-to-use-Single-Side-Staking-Delegate-to-Crypt-Keepers-b805429d797f4ed0847504987ce1f6e3?pvs=25">how to become a Crypt Keeper</a>. The single-sided staking program was <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/cryptexdao.eth/proposal/0x0c4f1f30e15cc920cd7851b7c2239379e65749c74b59236fa17b3545e674cb97">extended in November</a> via community vote.</p><h2>Tokenomics</h2><h3>CTX</h3><p>In April 2021, Cryptex <a href="https://medium.com/cryptexfinance/introducing-ctx-governance-powering-the-tcap-protocol-c1b32ce084bc">announced</a> the launch of its governance token, CTX. Tokenholders can use CTX to submit governance proposals, vote on such proposals, or delegate their votes.<br /></p><h4>CTX Distribution</h4><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/ec76a1ac598bd3ceb65cd1f599fbb717eebcea78-1600x868.png?w=800" /><p></p><p>CTX had an initial supply of 10 million tokens, which could inflate at a maximum of 2% per year, depending on the community. Minting new tokens could help in situations like when TCAP vaults are undercollateralized or incentives are needed for product development. The token distribution for CTX was as follows:</p><ul><li>Initial Protocol Incentives (25%)</li><li>Treasury (59.5%)</li><li>Founders (15%)</li><li>Advisors (0.5%)</li></ul><p>There was also an early adopter allocation to kickstart the governance process. Users who owned a vault during the first 14 days of CTX’s launch would be eligible for a portion of the 500,000 CTX allocated towards this initiative.</p><p>CTX currently has a little over <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/tokenholderchart/0x321C2fE4446C7c963dc41Dd58879AF648838f98D">2,000 holders</a>, with the top 100 addresses holding about 60% of the total allocation (excluding the <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x321C2fE4446C7c963dc41Dd58879AF648838f98D?a=0xa54074b2cc0e96a43048d4a68472f7f046ac0da8">Timelock</a> address). In November, the community voted on a <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/cryptexdao.eth/proposal/0x96484dfd692c7ca88a18e8112dc4150240b05b784168706ef018570b478dc82a">retroactive airdrop</a> to further incentivize governance participation. The airdrop was made available for eligible participants to claim in February.<br /></p><h3>TCAP</h3><p></p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/88226c0b94e4380c3df157019c5cbf5c005c957d-2677x1211.png?w=800" /><p></p><p><a href="https://app.cryptex.finance/v2/">TCAP</a> is a synthetic asset that is backed by ETH, DAI, and wBTC. Its price represents the total market cap of crypto divided by 10 billion, likely due to unit bias. Cryptex uses <a href="https://medium.com/cryptexfinance/cryptex-selects-chainlink-to-power-its-flagship-token-tcap-71461e73579f">Chainlink Oracles</a> to aggregate data from four distinct providers (CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, Coinpaprika, and CoinLore), which are used to find the <a href="https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/mcap-usd">average value onchain</a>. To acquire TCAP, users can either perform a swap on Uniswap/Sushi/Cryptex dapp or mint TCAP by locking up their own ETH, DAI, or wBTC. If the users wanted their collateral back, they would simply burn their TCAP. To protect users from malicious activity, the Cryptex DAO can pause the TCAP minting/burning software. As of writing, the community has not voted to use this feature.</p><p>TCAP functions similarly to a traditional index fund, and it offers some of the same benefits. These include more diversification, simplified portfolio management, and reduced costs. For a trader to gain exposure to crypto’s market cap, they would have to invest significant time and resources into understanding the intricacies of every wallet, exchange, and token.</p><p>The Cryptex dapp allows users to take both long and short positions on TCAP and to use up to 20x leverage on these trades. While it is free to mint TCAP, it should be noted that there is a <a href="https://cryptexfinance.notion.site/TCAP-e6a4ab3556254b52ad9b88319daa581e#:~:text=TCAP%20has%20no%20minting%20or%20streaming%20fees.%20Instead%2C%20a%201%25%20burn%20fee%20is%20applied%20to%20all%20transactions%20to%20fund%20Cryptex%20Finance%20DAO%20activities.">1% burn fee</a> associated with the token. Users can also take the maker side of the market by providing <a href="https://app.cryptex.finance/v2/liquidity">liquidity for TCAP trades</a>.</p><h4>Airdrops</h4><p>The Cryptex DAO has received two airdops, both of which ended up bolstering the liquidity of TCAP. In April 2023, the Cryptex team <a href="https://forum.cryptex.finance/t/utilizing-arb-token-allocation-to-incentivize-and-empower-the-cryptex-community/360">announced</a> that Cryptex was granted 75,000 ARB in recognition of its efforts in the DeFi space. The Cryptex team proposed to reinvest these tokens back into the community. Half of the ARB tokens were designated to enhance liquidity for the DAO's TCAP over a 60-day span. The remaining half was set to reward Cryptex V2 traders and a tiered referral system. The <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/cryptexdao.eth/proposal/0xa2445accdd988065ae4f478003c36321be2b9cdee1ddbba9b7ba1dcf1f159b63">vote passed</a>, with 90% in favor of the plan.</p><p>When Cryptex integrated with Pyth in November, Cryptex <a href="https://cryptex.finance/blog/2024-02-07-pyth-retroactive-airdrop/">was airdropped</a> 100,000 PYTH. The protocol subsequently conducted a <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/cryptexdao.eth/proposal/0x2327d7e847060ffb043a00b49d5e997992ebd83994acbd969ec27e144144f6e1">community snapshot vote</a> to decide how to use these tokens. The consensus led to the tokens being allocated to enhance TCAP liquidity.</p><h2>Risks and Challenges</h2><p>While Cryptex has several unique offerings, it has some hurdles to clear before it can claim a significant place in the DeFi space. One of the most notable challenges that Cryptex faces is overcoming a competitive landscape that is filled with larger, more established protocols. There is no shortage of decentralized perp exchanges, such as GMX or Vela. Both exchanges far outpace Cryptex in terms of total volume and users. For reference, GMX has seen <a href="https://dune.com/queries/2827533/4753953">$189.61 billion</a> in total volume compared to Cryptex’s <a href="https://dune.com/queries/2431693/4099226">$8.1 million</a>. For Cryptex to close the gap, it will likely have to establish a defensible moat by offering a unique product and continuing to foster an engaged community. In addition to TCAP and squared markets, Cryptex already has plans to offer baskets that track a curated list of top protocols by sectors (e.g., an AI basket).</p><p>Regarding TCAP itself, there is a fair amount of trust that must be placed in the oracles and their sources to provide accurate and up-to-date data. That said, Cryptex has not experienced any significant issues to date with this oracle dependency. In terms of liquidity, TCAP has been reinforced two times by outside resources through the Arbitrum and Pyth airdrops. While helpful in the short term, airdrops are not a sustainable source of liquidity.</p><p>While all decentralized trading platforms carry some risk, Cryptex faces the additional challenge of being limited by geo-political factors. In some countries like the U.S., there is a lack of clear legislation surrounding DeFi projects. As such, Cryptex’s offerings are only available on certain exchanges and platforms. Recognizing the inherent challenges that come with decentralized trading platforms, the Cryptex team proactively audited their protocol. Three separate audits were conducted regarding Cryptex’s <a href="https://cryptex.finance/Cryptex_-_Final_Report.pdf">vaults</a>, <a href="https://cryptex.finance/Cryptex_-_Staking_Report.pdf">single-sided staking</a>, and <a href="https://cryptex.finance/Cryptex_Finance_-_Artbitrum_Integration_-_Final_Report.pdf">governance bridge</a>.<br /></p><h2>Closing Summary</h2><p>For several years, Cryptex has iterated on its goal of making untradeable markets tradeable on the blockchain, as demonstrated in its flagship product, TCAP. The protocol’s evolution from Cryptex V1 to Cryptex π reflects a commitment to innovation. Its ongoing adaptations have been aimed at enhancing capital efficiency and trading experience on a foundation of decentralized governance. Through CTX governance, Cryptex aims to foster a participatory community, underscored by airdrops and strategic reinvestments to bolster its offerings.</p><p>Nevertheless, Cryptex must contend with formidable competitors and an ever-changing regulatory environment. Both factors pose substantial challenges to its expansion and long-term establishment in the market. The team plans to continue building custom indices and deploy new perpetual markets, as well as eventually expanding to more L2s and networks. Cryptex’s constant innovation, coupled with the engagement of its governance community, will be pivotal in securing a sustainable position in the DeFi space.</p></div>

<title>Understanding Primex Finance: A Comprehensive Overview</title>
<link>https://messari.io/article/understanding-primex-a-comprehensive-overview</link>
<guid>https://messari.io/article/understanding-primex-a-comprehensive-overview</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。Primex V1和V2为无需超额抵押的去中心化交易所（DEXs）上的现货保证金交易提供了强大的平台。通过引入信用桶，管理者和公证人，Primex创造了一个去中心化的生态系统，允许高效管理流动性、风险评估和治理，确保安全而灵活的交易环境。 PMX代币在该生态系统中扮演着重要角色。它既是治理和实用代币，激励参与，并促进各种协议操作，包括管理者奖励和协议费用支付。 V2为Primex带来了更大的愿景，为加密货币引入了去中心化的组合保证金。尽管其创新性方法，Primex的设计仍有依赖和限制，需要依靠去中心化桥梁进行跨链操作，并需要预言机价格通知管理者。Primex将在2024年为当前协议增加更多抵押能力和交易场所。其路线图承诺将更复杂的DeFi操作和保证金提供给链上交易者。 <div>
<div><h2>Introduction to Primex V1</h2><p>Primex V1 enables spot margin trading on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) without the need for over-collateralization. It is a permissionless, smart-contract-operated prime brokerage available on Ethereum, Polygon, and Arbitrum. Primex V1 addresses the challenge of enabling users to trade undercollateralized leveraged spot assets onchain. As the team adds new primitives and assets, Primex could offer portfolio margining on various DeFi positions such as spot, LP, and lending.</p><p><br />Primex was first announced in June of 2021 by Primex Labs out of Estonia. The team raised $5.7 million for a seed round in February 2022, led by CoinFund and Stratos Technologies, with participation from Wintermute, GSR, GoldenTree Asset Management, and others. Primex Labs is led by co-founders Vlad Kostanda and Dmitry Tolok, as well as CTO Alex Marukhnenko and CMO Anton Demenko. In May 2022, the team launched the alpha testnet, with the beta launch on Polygon in October 2023. In Q4’23, Primex expanded to Arbitrum and Ethereum.</p><p><br /></p><h2>The Protocol</h2><p>Primex is building a marketplace where lenders and borrowers can interact. Primex liquidity pools (called credit buckets) offer different parameters and associated risks and rewards for lenders than traditional DEXs or lending protocols. There are different pools for different assets, so lenders can choose to allocate to pools that meet their risk tolerance. Traders are the typical borrowers, and they can access that liquidity by choosing an asset to borrow and a credit bucket that matches their needs.<br /></p><p>There are four key players in the Primex ecosystem:</p><ol><li><strong>Lenders</strong> provide liquidity to the credit buckets. This liquidity is then accessed by traders for leveraged trading. Lenders earn interest from the borrowing fees paid by traders, offering a mechanism for passive income generation.</li><li><strong>Traders</strong> seek to leverage their positions to gain exposure to a wide range of assets listed on DEXs. Rather than receiving borrowed funds directly in their wallets, traders perform their trades through credit bucket contracts. Doing so enables more capital efficiency and ensures that positions can be liquidated efficiently.</li><li><strong>Keepers</strong> are bots that monitor positions and orders to perform various actions such as executing limit orders, closing positions under certain conditions, and liquidating risky positions. Keepers play a crucial role in maintaining the stability and security of the Primex ecosystem.</li><li><strong>Notaries (in future versions)</strong> will be trusted participants responsible for making decisions about parameter updates within the Primex protocol. These parameters can be global, affecting the entire ecosystem, or specific to credit buckets (such as supported pairs, leverages, and interest rates). Notaries will be nominated by the community through a staking process, and both the notaries and their nominators would be rewarded for their successful contributions. The core team will be responsible for these parameter changes at genesis. As the protocol matures and gets battle-tested, this role will decentralize to notaries.</li></ol><p>The smart contract architecture of Primex V1 is designed to facilitate the four key players’ interactions seamlessly. Credit buckets are fundamental smart contracts that include a set of parameters defining pool usage rules, such as supported pairs, leverage options, liquidation rules, interest rates for lenders, and fees for traders. These buckets act as an intermediary between lenders, traders, and other DeFi protocols like DEXs, enabling a decentralized and efficient trading environment.</p><p><br /></p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/6c1f5bbe3256bdc505b9ab1a13f49f5ca53af031-643x272.png?w=800" /><p>Source: <a href="https://docsend.com/view/3hnzsv24nvvzbpac">Primex Whitepaper</a></p><p><br />Credit buckets enable a mechanism of leveraging liquidity for trading while maintaining a controlled environment for risk management. The product is key to Primex V1 facilitating leveraged spot trading in a decentralized manner.</p><p></p><p>Primex differentiates itself from perp DEXs by giving exposure to spot instead of synthetic assets. With this mechanism, collateral only needs to be sufficient to cover losses, not capital at risk. As with perp DEXs, Primex users post collateral on the DEX and can have leveraged exposure. If the losses become greater than the collateral, then their positions would get liquidated and they would lose their collateral. Users can tap into their margin to access DEX liquidity instead of relying on market makers or LP collateral.</p><p></p><p>For instance, imagine a user had 1 ETH worth $3,000 and wanted to buy UNI. Using Primex, she could combine her assets with liquidity deposited by lenders to get an undercollateralized loan. If she borrowed $6,000 in ETH she could buy $9,000 worth of UNI on Uniswap (using her $3,000 and the $6,000 loan from Primex). She would owe interest on the amount borrowed, and she could only use it to buy UNI (assuming those are the rules of the bucket, for this example). If UNI were to fall by 33%, or whatever the liquidation rules of the credit bucket are, she would be liquidated, lose her ETH, and repay the loan. However, if UNI were to rise by 33%, she could sell the UNI for $12,000 in USDC, pay back her $6,000 loan, and take home $3,000 in profit (a 100% return).</p><p></p><p>However, Primex V1 has certain dependencies and limitations. For instance, the protocol's efficiency and flexibility in cross-chain operations are contingent upon the capabilities of decentralized bridges. Additionally, the protocol must rely on keepers for the execution of critical protocol functions. This introduces a layer of complexity, as Primex requires a robust network of bots to ensure the accurate execution of trades and liquidations. Lastly, Primex needs oracles to validate the actions of keepers and protect users from price manipulation. To enforce this, the protocol incorporates the concept of Oracle Tolerance (OT). OT accounts for the maximum price deviation from the oracle price when executing significant asset swaps on DEXs. This parameter is crucial for defining liquidation conditions as well as conditional orders like limits and stops. Primex also recently updated their docs and added the ability to be oracle-agnostic, adding flexibility and enabling new assets. The first oracles added are Chainlink, Pyth, and TWAP oracles from Uniswap v3 pools.</p><h2><br />Vision for Primex V2</h2><p><a href="https://blog.primex.finance/introducing-primex-v2-a-new-era-for-the-protocol-651b7a57656c">Primex V2</a> represents an evolution from its predecessor, Primex V1, marking a transition towards a more comprehensive and versatile platform within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. The vision for Primex V2 is to transform the protocol from a spot margin trading platform into a DeFi-native prime brokerage.</p><p><br /></p><p>Prime brokerage solves the problem of liquidity and capital efficiency for users by offering access to borrowing and trading against a portfolio of assets, rather than just one-to-one. This consolidation allows clients to optimize their investment strategies, leveraging the brokerage's resources to enhance their market position and performance.</p><p><br />One of the core innovations of Primex V2 is the introduction of the portfolio concept, which replaces individual positions as the central element of the protocol. A portfolio in Primex V2 can consist of various types of cryptoassets, DeFi positions, or debt, represented through both fungible assets (like cryptocurrencies and lending LP tokens) and non-fungible assets (such as Uniswap V3 LP position NFTs). This allows for a more flexible and dynamic approach to managing leveraged operations. To protect lenders and manage risks, the portfolio's value and liquidation value are recalculated in real time with price changes of the underlying assets.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, Primex V2 aims to democratize access to leveraged trading by removing constraints that previously limited borrowers to interacting only with pre-integrated protocols. By enabling users to specify contracts and engage with any protocol of their choice, Primex V2 facilitates a more open and versatile trading environment. This approach is somewhat analogous to flash loans, focusing on the repayment of the debt plus fees rather than the specifics of how the liquidity is utilized.</p><p></p><p>An interesting feature of Primex V2 is the ability to create hedged strategies by combining leveraged LP positions with spot margin positions. This allows traders to manage risk more effectively within a single protocol, without the need to rebalance positions across multiple platforms. Moreover, the introduction of flash loan functionality to credit buckets in Primex V2 enables borrowers to take out loans without collateral, provided the funds are repaid within the same transaction. This feature is designed for experienced users who can leverage these loans for arbitrage or other quick trading opportunities.</p><p><br />In summary, Primex V2's vision is to establish a more inclusive, flexible, and secure platform for leveraged trading and financial operations within the DeFi space. By expanding the range of supported assets, introducing innovative features like portfolios to credit buckets, and facilitating universal leveraged interaction with any protocol, Primex V2 might be able to deliver a smart contract-based prime brokerage service.</p><p><br /></p><h2>PMX Token</h2><p>The PMX token serves both as a governance and utility token within the Primex ecosystem. The token has not launched yet, and the protocol currently uses ePMX with restricted transferability. ePMX holders will be able to convert to PMX after the token launch. PMX will primarily be used for keeper incentivization and protocol fee payments. This limited functionality is designed to ensure stability and security as the protocol transitions from its initial launch phase to more stable operations. In the long term, the utility of PMX will expand significantly. It will enable holders to vote on critical protocol decisions, thereby participating in the community governance process. Additionally, PMX will be used to incentivize various participants in the ecosystem, including traders, lenders, and keepers, playing a vital role in the consensus mechanisms for keepers and notaries. This broad range of utilities aims to ensure the active and engaged participation of all stakeholders in the protocol's governance and operations, fostering a decentralized and efficient trading environment.</p><p></p><p>The initial distribution of 1 billion PMX tokens is categorized into community, treasury, team and advisors, strategic investors, and inflation. Specifically, the distribution percentages are as follows:</p><ul><li>35% to the community.<ul><li>30% of which goes to the early users and lenders.</li><li>18% of which goes to the public sale pool.</li><li>9% of which goes to Grants.</li><li>3% of which goes to audits and bug bounties.</li><li>20% of which goes to market making.</li><li>20% to early bucket notaries (18-month lock-up).</li></ul></li><li>11% to the treasury.</li><li>21% to the foundation and advisors (48-month vesting period).</li><li>23% to strategic investors (18-month vesting period).</li><li>10% dedicated to inflation.</li></ul><p><br />In the Primex protocol, fees are paid by traders depending on how they use the protocol. The exact amount of each fee might be dynamic, as details have not been released yet.</p><ul><li><strong>Traders</strong> encounter fees in the following areas:<ul><li><strong>Interest Rate</strong>: This is charged for using lenders' liquidity and is paid in the borrowed asset. It's a direct cost associated with the leverage provided to the Trader for their trading activities.<ul><li><strong>Reserve Fee</strong>: A portion of the Borrowing Fee, which goes to the Reserve in the form of pTokens (the interest-bearing version of the token). This fee contributes to the protocol's risk management and liquidity provision mechanisms.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Protocol Fee</strong>: Pays for protocol usage and keepers’ job, which can be settled in either the chain's native token (such as ETH) or in PMX, and is collected and stored in the Treasury. This fee is assessed once when a position is opened and depends on the total asset amount (the borrowed asset plus the deposit) without relying on the time during which this asset is being utilized. The total protocol fee will not exceed 0.3%, with a target value of 0.15% with protocol volume growth. The team has announced the update of the fee model splitting this fee in the following way:<ul><li><strong>Protocol Usage Fee</strong>: Paid for protocol usage, can be settled in either the position asset or in PMX. This fee is assessed when a position is closed as a percentage of the total position size. This enables traders to generate higher returns from small positions as the value of their positions is not reduced by the size of the fees from the outset, offering greater potential for growth.</li><li><strong>Condition Action Fee</strong>: If traders use a condition order like limit buys or stop-loss selling, they must pay a fee to keepers for their services. This makes fees more fair as traders only pay for services they use.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Lenders</strong> are subject to:<ul><li><strong>Withdrawal Fee</strong>: Charged when they withdraw liquidity from buckets, calculated as a percentage of the funds they withdraw. This fee is part of the protocol's mechanism to manage liquidity efficiently and ensure stability within the credit buckets.</li></ul></li></ul><p>These fees are collected and stored in the Treasury. The Reserve and Treasury periodically exchange accumulated fees to PMX or other necessary tokens, which are then distributed to keepers as needed. This mechanism ensures that the PMX token plays a central role in the protocol's economic activities, incentivizing participation and contributing to the protocol's sustainability.</p><p><br /></p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Primex V1 and V2 present a robust platform for spot margin trading on DEXs without the need for overcollateralization. Through the introduction of credit buckets, keepers, and notaries, Primex creates a decentralized ecosystem that allows for efficient liquidity management, risk assessment, and governance, ensuring a secure and flexible trading environment. The PMX token plays a central role in this ecosystem. It serves as both a governance and utility token, incentivizes participation, and facilitates various protocol operations, including keeper rewards and protocol fee payments. V2 brings an even bigger vision for Primex, introducing decentralized portfolio margining to crypto. </p><p>Despite its innovative approach, Primex's design has dependencies and limitations. For example, it must rely on decentralized bridges for cross-chain operations and needs oracle prices to inform keepers. Primex will be adding more collateral capabilities and trading venues to the current protocol in 2024. Its roadmap promises more complex DeFi actions and margin to be made available to onchain traders.</p></div>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。本周SEC在多个方面遭遇挑战。一方面，一家加密公司因SEC对其提出虚假指控而获得法院制裁。另一方面，共和党人批评SEC主席的强硬立法和未能明确规定数字资产规则。与此同时，SEC表示需要更多资金来履行其使命，提及市场增长、变化和加密市场的"狂野西部"。议员们表示稳定币立法仍然存在，但找到一个立法载体至关重要。 <div>
<p>It was a busy week for the SEC. A federal district court sanctioned the agency for making multiple misleading claims to secure a temporary restraining order against a crypto firm. At an SEC oversight hearing, Republicans criticized the Chair's aggressive rulemaking and failure to provide clear rules for digital assets. Meanwhile, the SEC said it needed more funding to fulfill its mission, citing market growth, market changes, and the "Wild West of the crypto markets." House Financial Services Chair Patrick McHenry and Senator Cynthia Lummis say stablecoin legislation is still alive, but finding a legislative vehicle remains key.</p>

As stakers are incentivized to delegate to high-performing and “safer” validators, stake may begin concentrating at the top.</p><p>Marinade Finance is an automated staking protocol on Solana, offering liquid and native staking solutions. By delegating stake to over 100 top-performing validators, Marinade aids in decentralizing the Solana validator set without harming staker APY. Between its liquid and native products, Marinade has over $1.8 billion in TVL. Marinade plans to delegate to even more validators once it introduces Protected Staking Rewards and the upcoming delegation strategy update, all while preserving its APY.</p><h2><strong>Background</strong></h2><p>Marinade was <a href="https://marinade.finance/blog/the-first-liquid-staking-solution-on-solana/">founded</a> during the March 2021 Solana x Serum Hackathon, winning the 3rd place prize of around <a href="https://marinade.finance/blog/state-of-marinade-in-the-wake-of-ftx-alameda/">$80,000</a>. After the hackathon, the Marinade team connected with <a href="https://twitter.com/lucio_tato">Lucio Tato</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/mbroeken">Marco Broeken</a>, who also submitted a liquid staking solution for the same hackathon. The two teams ultimately decided to <a href="https://marinade.finance/blog/stronger-together/">work together</a> under the Marinade brand.</p><p>After a <a href="https://marinade.finance/blog/liquid-staking-on-solana/">devnet launch</a> on Solana in May 2021, Marinade launched on <a href="https://marinade.finance/blog/what-a-launch/">mainnet</a> on August 2, 2021. A few months later, Marinade’s governance token MNDE was <a href="https://marinade.finance/blog/mnde-launch-serving-the-tastiest-token/">released</a>, with a retroactive airdrop for holders of Marinade SOL (mSOL). In April 2022, Marinade’s onchain governance <a href="https://marinade.finance/blog/let-marinades-on-chain-governance-begin/">launched</a>, which later migrated to governance platform <a href="https://app.realms.today/dao/MNDE">Realms</a> in July 2023.</p><p>Marinade has not raised any venture capital funding or conducted any public token sales. Instead, Marinade’s native token MNDE has mainly been distributed via various campaigns to reward users and contributors, detailed in the Tokenomics section below.</p><p>Marinade’s liquid staking protocol has undergone several updates since its launch, including new delegation strategies and <a href="https://marinade.finance/blog/introducing-protected-staking-rewards/">Protected Staking Rewards</a>. Marinade launched a native staking product, <a href="https://medium.com/marinade-finance/introducing-marinade-native-fdb641d98e64">Marinade Native</a>, in July 2023 to counterpart its liquid staking solution.</p><h2><strong>Technology</strong></h2><h3><strong>Marinade Liquid</strong></h3><p>Marinade’s original product is its liquid staking protocol. The protocol enables users to deposit SOL and receive a token receipt as mSOL. The deposited SOL is staked to validators according to Marinade’s Delegation Strategy, described below. As staking rewards accrue to the underlying staked SOL pools, mSOL appreciates relative to SOL over time.</p><p>Compared to native staking on Solana, liquid staking offers several advantages, including:</p><ul><li>No Opportunity Cost: SOL holders can opt out of dilution from inflation (currently 5.4% annualized inflation) while still partaking in other opportunities, such as DeFi.</li><li>No Unbonding Period: Natively staked tokens cannot be withdrawn until the epoch's end (every 2-3 days). Liquid stakers, however, can immediately swap from mSOL to SOL, assuming enough liquidity.</li><li>Stake Distribution and Management: When staking natively, it might be cumbersome to distribute stake across many validators. Furthermore, the average staker does not have the tools to monitor validators and automatically re-delegate in case of commission rugs, validator downtimes, or other performance issues. Marinade Liquid does all of this for stakers, aiding in both the decentralization of Solana’s validator network and the return to stakers.</li><li>Potential Tax Benefits: Depending on the tax jurisdiction, liquid staking can present the advantage of its rewards being taxed as capital gains rather than income.</li></ul><p>While liquid staking introduces several benefits, it also brings some smart contract risk. Users must place some trust in the contract that stores deposited SOL and mints mSOL. If it has a vulnerability, a malicious actor could steal the SOL or mint mSOL out of thin air. To that end, Marinade’s smart contracts were audited in 2021 by <a href="https://marinade.finance/docs/KudelskiSecurity.pdf">Kudelski Security</a> and <a href="https://marinade.finance/docs/AckeeBlockchain.pdf">Ackee Blockchain</a>, with audits on upgraded contracts in 2023 by <a href="https://marinade.finance/docs/Neodyme_2023.pdf">Neodyme</a> and <a href="https://marinade.finance/docs/Sec3_2023.pdf">Sec3</a>.</p><p>The primary fee involved in Marinade Liquid is a 6% fee on rewards. Based on a 7% APY, this translates to around a 0.42% fee on staked SOL. There is no deposit fee or unstake fee if a user waits for the epoch to end. If a user wants to instantly unstake, the fee ranges from 0.1% to 9% based on a <a href="https://docs.marinade.finance/marinade-protocol/system-overview/unstake-liquidity-pool">formula</a> that tracks the liquidity in a protocol-owned mSOL/SOL pool. Half of the fees go to the liquidity providers, and the other half go to Marinade’s treasury. On Marinade’s UI, the DEX aggregator Jupiter is used for instant unstaking, which sources liquidity from Marinade’s protocol-owned pool and mSOL/SOL pools in various third-party DeFi protocols.</p><p>The liquidity pool at its steady state is designed to contain 100% SOL (liquidity providers can only deposit SOL, not mSOL). If mSOL is deposited via an instant unstake order, the Marinade protocol rebalances the pool back to 100% SOL by using that mSOL as the next mSOL provided for a stake operation. The new staker’s SOL would then go to the liquidity pool at no cost to the user. Besides instant unstake orders, the liquidity pool is used for mSOL liquidations and to match staking and unstaking orders.</p><h3><strong>Marinade Native</strong></h3><p>In July 2023, Marinade <a href="https://marinade.finance/blog/introducing-marinade-native/">introduced</a> Marinade Native, a native staking product in conjunction with its liquid staking product. Marinade Native stakes SOL to Solana validators using the same delegations strategy as Marinade Liquid, described below.</p><p>Rather than receiving mSOL, Marinade Native stakers receive SOL rewards sent to their stake accounts every epoch. Furthermore, Marinade Native stakers retain custody of their SOL and are not introduced to any smart contract risk. Under Solana’s stake account structure, every account has a stake authority and a withdraw authority. Marinade Native receives stake authority but has no access to withdraw authority. Users can revoke Marinade Native’s stake authority access at any time.</p><p>Marinade Native has no management fee, unlike the 6% Marinade Liquid fee on rewards. Like Marinade Liquid, Marinade Native does not have a fee on deposits; however, it does have a fixed 0.001 SOL fee on all withdrawals.</p><p>Marinade Native introduces the same “Stake Distribution and Management” benefit as Marinade Liquid. It allows stakers to easily distribute their stake across top-performing validators while enjoying virtually the same qualities as native staking.</p><h3><strong>Delegation Strategy</strong></h3><p>SOL deposited in Marinade Liquid and Native are staked to validators based on the following criteria:</p><ul><li>60% – Marinade’s Algorithmic Delegation Strategy<ul><li>Marinade considers all active validators every epoch and gives <a href="https://github.com/marinade-finance/delegation-strategy-pipeline">scores</a> to eligible ones.<ul><li>Eligible validators have at least 10 epochs of data (roughly a month), a maximum of 10% commission in the past 10 epochs, and a minimum stake of at least 1,000 SOL.</li><li>Eligible validators are then <a href="https://docs.marinade.finance/marinade-protocol/validators#performance-based-score">scored</a> based on their commission-adjusted APY, percentage of blocks produced out of leader slots assigned, and decentralization based on data centers.</li></ul></li><li>Marinade’s stake is then distributed to the top 100 validators based on their scores. This operation is managed by a set of permissionless bots (anyone can run them).</li><li>Validators can also get blacklisted if they display vote lagging, commission rugs (e.g., raising commission to 100%), or twice fail to restart their node in 36 hours following a cluster restart after a blockchain halt. Blacklisted validators can appeal or demonstrate reformed behavior and be removed, but repeat offenders or one-time commission rug offenders are permanently blacklisted.</li></ul></li><li>20% – MNDE Directed Stake<ul><li>MNDE stakers can vote on validators, with 20% of Marinade TVL staked to validators proportionally based on the votes.</li><li>Validator eligibility rules are the same as the Marinade delegation strategy except<ul><li>The minimum stake is 100 instead of 1,000 SOL</li><li>Instead of being in the top 100 scores, the validator’s score must be at least 90% of the lowest-scored validator picked by the delegation strategy.</li></ul></li><li>Votes for a single validator are capped at 10% of total votes. If a validator receives more than 10% of the total votes, the overflow votes are distributed to other validators proportionally based on their votes or to validators picked by the delegation strategy if fewer than 10 eligible validators are voted for.</li></ul></li><li>20% – mSOL Directed Stake<ul><li>mSOL holders can vote on validators, with 20% of Marinade TVL staked to validators proportionally based on the votes. Users can vote with mSOL even if it’s deposited in select DeFi protocols.</li><li>Validator eligibility rules are the same as the Marinade delegation strategy except<ul><li>There are no minimum stake requirements</li><li>Instead of being in the top 100 scores, the validator’s score must be at least 80% of the lowest-scored validator picked by the delegation strategy.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>The above delegation strategy has been in effect since the March 2023 delegation strategy <a href="https://marinade.finance/blog/introducing-new-and-improved-delegation-formula/">update</a>. Another <a href="https://forum.marinade.finance/t/delegation-strategy-updates-finally/851">update</a> is in the works, which was recently <a href="https://app.realms.today/dao/MNDE/proposal/UbwXpefrUjrECWnbqHMA1z3c3UbCYBGkHVLhS7jcbUx">approved</a> via governance. Notable changes include:</p><ul><li>In addition to the hosting data center, decentralization scores will include overall stake distribution, hosting country, and hosting city. Accounting for overall stake distribution will improve Solana’s Nakamoto coefficient by delegating more stake to smaller validators.</li><li>As Marinade’s TVL grows, the number of validators receiving stake via the algorithmic delegation strategy can increase above 100.</li><li>MNDE and mSOL holders can allocate votes toward the algorithmic stake instead of only specific validators.</li><li>The maximum commission for eligible validators will be reduced from 10% to 8%.</li></ul><p><strong>Protected Staking Rewards</strong></p><p>In mid-February 2024, Marinade began the launch of <a href="https://marinade.finance/blog/introducing-protected-staking-rewards/">Protected Staking Rewards</a> (PSR). <a href="https://medium.com/marinade-finance/protected-staking-rewards-and-delegation-strategy-updates-098a23f8a851">PSR</a> enforces an onchain service-level agreement protecting stakers from reduced rewards for reasons such as validator performance issues or commission rugs. PSR requires validators to put up a bond to be eligible for Marinade stake. The required bond amount will equal 1 SOL for every 10,000 SOL received from Marinade delegation. The Marinade DAO will also commit 4 SOL for every 10,000 SOL delegated. Validator bonds will cover initial losses, with Marinade’s bond covering extended losses. As such, PSR allows Marinade to stake to more validators without sacrificing APY to stakers.</p><p>By February 15, validators needed to set up their bond to be eligible for stake, although the bond did not yet need to be funded. Over 330 validators have set up their bond so far. Neodyme is currently auditing the validator bonds contract. Once the audit is completed, Marinade will implement the governance <a href="https://app.realms.today/dao/MNDE/proposal/9j921vMYNm4LbUBL75CQr1qkJt2fq6ZLv9xTCS8yXhqw">proposal</a> that was recently passed to formally integrate PSR.</p><h2><strong>Tokenomics</strong></h2><h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3><p>Marinade’s token MNDE is used for governance and growth initiatives. MNDE currently has a capped supply of 1 billion tokens. Around 22.5% of the total supply has been allocated to the team, with the rest going to the DAO. The DAO has allocated tokens toward various initiatives, with around 63% of the total supply still unallocated. At a circulating supply of 257 million, MNDE’s market cap currently stands at over $65 million.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/b5c1f1f3e8b66e20670123a341553e5cd491596b-6400x3688.png?w=800" /><h3><strong>Initial Distribution</strong></h3><p>MNDE launched in November 2021 with a capped supply of 1 billion tokens. Of those tokens, 35% were allocated to the community, 35% to the DAO, and 30% to the Marinade team.</p><h3><strong>Team Token Allocation Changes</strong></h3><p>After a six-month lockup, the team’s tokens began vesting linearly in April 2022. The linear vesting was extended from 2 to 4 years in August 2022. In February 2023, the team <a href="https://marinade.finance/blog/mnde-tokenomics-update-revisiting-incentives/">announced</a> it would be reallocating 225 million MNDE to the DAO (22.5% of the total supply), reducing its allocation to 75 million tokens, 63 million of which had already been unlocked. The remaining 12 million tokens finished vesting in January 2024.</p><p>At the same time, the team announced that subject to governance, 138 million MNDE would be allocated to the team from the DAO. Instead of purely time-based unlocks, this distribution incorporates performance-based elements. At each milestone, 46 million MNDE would be allocated when TVL reaches 8 million, 16 million, and 32 million SOL. For each milestone, the team could request up to 2 million MNDE monthly to cover any operation expenses that outweighed protocol revenue. If the TVL milestones are hit, the rest of the budget will be unlocked with a 12-month vesting schedule.</p><p>In October 2023, Marinade reached the 8 million SOL TVL milestone. Of the 46 million MNDE allocated for this milestone, over 37 million MNDE remained in the operational budget, initiating a 12-month monthly vesting period. Subsequently, another 46 million MNDE was earmarked in anticipation of reaching the next milestone of 16 million SOL TVL.</p><p>Additionally, around 11.6 million MNDE was distributed from the DAO for initial contributor grants.</p><h3><strong>Growth Initiatives</strong></h3><p>Tokens not distributed to the team have been distributed by various initiatives:</p><p><em>Retroactive Rewards (Token Launch)</em>: <em>Distributed 20 million MNDE as a retroactive airdrop.</em></p><p>At launch, 20 million tokens (2% of the total supply) were airdropped as <a href="https://docs.marinade.finance/the-mnde-token/retroactive-rewards">retroactive rewards</a> to mSOL holders, LPs in the Marinade mSOL/SOL pool and other ecosystem integrations, and devnet participants.</p><p><em>Liquidity Mining Rewards (Token Launch - July 2023)</em>: <em>Distributed over 78 million MNDE as liquidity rewards in mSOL DeFi pools.</em></p><p>At launch, 350 million MNDE (35% of total supply) was allocated toward <a href="https://docs.marinade.finance/the-mnde-token/liquidity-mining">liquidity mining</a> at a target rate of around 1.7 million MNDE per week. An additional 80 million MNDE would be allocated as liquidity mining bonuses if several Marinade TVL milestones were reached (starting at 3 million SOL and reaching 100 million SOL).</p><p>Originally, the Marinade team <a href="https://marinade.finance/blog/mnde-launch-serving-the-tastiest-token/">decided</a> what liquidity pools were incentivized and with how much MNDE. In July 2022, a <a href="https://forum.marinade.finance/t/mdao-governance-proposal-liquidity-mining-gauges/190">proposal</a> was <a href="https://tribeca.so/gov/mnde/proposals/7">passed</a> to hand over this decision-making to MNDE holders via governance. Through liquidity gauges on governance platform <a href="https://tribeca.so/gov/mnde/proposals">Tribeca</a>, MNDE holders could vote on which protocols to allocate liquidity mining rewards. Additionally, the proposal implemented a weekly distribution cap of 1 million MNDE.</p><p>Throughout 2022, <a href="https://forum.marinade.finance/t/rethinking-liquidity-mining-gauges/290">discussions</a> about the liquidity mining program often concluded that it was not effectively incentivizing the sticky growth of mSOL TVL in DeFi protocols. This conclusion was reinforced by the fact that Marinade’s TVL was largely flat from Q4’21 until the FTX collapse in Q4’22. After the FTX collapse, DeFi activity on Solana reduced even more.</p><p>Thus, the DAO decided to further reduce emissions from the program. A “do not distribute” gauge was added that sent rewards back to the treasury. Around 77% of the budget was allocated to the “do not distribute” gauge. In January 2023, a <a href="https://forum.marinade.finance/t/reduce-liquidity-mining-weekly-rate-by-75/442/1">proposal</a> was <a href="https://tribeca.so/gov/mnde/proposals/29">passed</a> to reduce weekly rewards to 250,000 MNDE. Over 75% of votes still went to the “do not distribute” gauge, meaning only around 60,000 MNDE were distributed weekly. In July 2023, liquidity mining rewards, including the TVL milestones, were fully paused.</p><p>In total, just over 78 million MNDE were distributed via the liquidity mining program. Of that, 10.5 million came from the first two TVL milestones, which were reached in the first week.</p><p><em>Token Exchange Program (June 2022)</em>: <em>Distributed over 9.8 million MNDE to several DeFi protocols and validators in exchange for 483,000 USDC and 500,000 SLND.</em></p><p>In June 2022, a governance <a href="https://forum.marinade.finance/t/marinade-token-exchange-program/221">proposal</a> was <a href="https://tribeca.so/gov/mnde/proposals/8">passed</a> to execute a token exchange <a href="https://marinade.finance/blog/marinade-dao-executes-token-exchange-program-to-align-with-leading-solana-builders/">program</a> with several DeFi protocols and validators, <a href="https://marinade.finance/blog/marinade-kitchen-stories-june-2022/#:~:text=first%20video%20here-,Marinade%20DAO%20Financial%20Overview%20%E2%80%94%20June%202022,-Marinade%20DAO%20Financial">exchanging</a> 9.8 million MNDE for 483,000 USDC and 500,000 SLND. The exchange program <a href="https://forum.marinade.finance/t/marinade-token-exchange-program/221#what-is-the-rationale-behind-the-proposal-6">aimed</a> to align Marinade with strategic partners, diversify its treasury, and enable selected partners to purchase MNDE at a size that would’ve caused over 30% slippage in the open market. Participating DeFi protocols included Solend, Raydium, Friktion, Port, and Crema. Participating validators included Staking Facilities, Shinobi Systems, Cogent Crypto, Laine (Stakewiz), Blockdaemon, Stakin, and Solana Compass. MNDE was distributed with a 30-day unlocking period.</p><p><em>Open Doors Program (February 2023 - January 2024)</em>:<em> Distributed 1.7 million MNDE to protocols, validators, and individuals based on their contributions to mSOL growth, with another six months of rewards to distribute.</em></p><p>Marinade <a href="https://marinade.finance/blog/introducing-the-open-doors-program/">introduced</a> the <a href="https://marinade.notion.site/marinade/Invitation-Marinade-Open-Doors-program-8eef7e294a7d4b51a5d8aea1fe0ca8b2">Open Doors Program</a> in January 2023. Open Doors was a 12-month program offering up to 160 million MNDE (16% of the total supply) incentives to protocols, validators, and individuals. The program aimed to improve upon the liquidity mining program by rewarding entities retroactively based on their contributions to Marinade’s TVL increase rather than proactively trying to incentivize it.</p><p>The program distributed MNDE to:</p><ul><li><em>Protocols</em> based on their net mSOL TVL increase. The rewards went directly to protocols, leaving it up to them to pass it on to users.</li><li><em>Validators </em>that converted their self-stake to liquid stake and/or received directed stake (once directed stake launched).</li><li><em>Individuals</em> based on how much SOL was staked in Marinade through their referral link via Marinade’s <a href="https://docs.marinade.finance/partnerships/referral-program">referral program</a>.</li></ul><p>Rewards were tracked and distributed on a two-month cycle. The amount distributed in each two-month period equaled Marinade’s average TVL in the period subtracted by its TVL on February 1, 2023, then multiplied by four (giving out rewards at a rate of 4 MNDE per 1 mSOL) and then divided by six (to account for there being six two-month periods). Rewards were distributed back to protocols, validators, and individuals in proportion to their individual net mSOL TVL increase. Around, 2.6 million MNDE was <a href="https://forum.marinade.finance/t/proposal-launch-160m-mnde-open-doors-tvl-program/398/50">distributed</a> for the program.</p><p><em>Marinade Earn (October 2023 - present)</em>: <em>Distributed 9.7 million MNDE to mSOL holders in Season 1, with up to 25 million MNDE eligible for distribution in the ongoing Season 2.</em></p><p>In September 2023, a <a href="https://forum.marinade.finance/t/mdao-proposal-launch-160m-mnde-incentive-campaign-for-msol-marinade-native/529/19">proposal</a> was <a href="https://app.realms.today/dao/MNDE/proposal/EQ8Fua5r1oKGTZPSiJztfE2o8c3WqieTuP9uoGmMjyzs">passed</a> to launch Season 1 of Marinade Earn. Marinade Earn Season 1 distributed 1 MNDE per 1 SOL staked in Marinade Liquid (i.e., mSOL token-holders) or Marinade Native from October 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023. Rewards were pro-rated if a user did not hold mSOL for the entirety of the program. Users would also receive rewards if their mSOL was deposited in <a href="https://marinade.finance/blog/introducing-marinade-earn-season-1/#:~:text=You%20can%20also%20use%20your%20mSOL%20in%20participating%20Snapshot%20protocols%3A%20Solend%2C%20Marginfi%2C%20Raydium%2C%20Orca%2C%20Saber%2C%20Mango%2C%20Drift%2C%20and%20Super%20Stake%20SOL.%20Some%20of%20these%20partners%20may%20also%20be%20offering%20their%20own%20MNDE%20incentives.">select DeFi protocols</a>. In addition, Marinade Earn incentivized Marinade Native referrals, distributing 1 MNDE per 1 SOL staked in Marinade Native via referral links. In total, around 9.7 million MNDE was distributed as Season 1 rewards, which were distributed at the end of the campaign with a 30-day unlocking period.</p><p>After Season 1, a <a href="https://forum.marinade.finance/t/dao-proposal-unlock-a-25m-mnde-budget-for-marinade-earn-season-2/717">proposal</a> was <a href="https://app.realms.today/dao/MNDE/proposal/6SUme3kKLLEsHP21fqJtYVQK2v1QRkR29Lj2vvgXG7B1">passed</a> to launch <a href="https://marinade.finance/blog/let-marinade-earn-season-2-begin/">Season 2</a>, rewarding Marinade stakers from January 1, 2024, to March 31, 2024. Changes from Season 1 include:</p><ul><li>1 MNDE per 2 SOL staked, instead of 1 MNDE per 1 SOL staked.</li><li>No more rewards for Marinade Native referrals, as only around 300,000 MNDE was earned via the Native referral campaign in Season 1.</li><li>Additional bonuses to:<ul><li>MNDE holders locking tokens to direct stake will earn additional incentives based on 2 SOL per 1 MNDE ratio over the three months.</li><li>Validators based on their algorithmic stake score.</li></ul></li><li>Total rewards capped at 25 million MNDE.</li></ul><h3><strong>Governance</strong></h3><p>Beyond growth initiatives, MNDE is also used for Marinade DAO governance. When Marinade’s governance <a href="https://marinade.finance/blog/let-marinades-on-chain-governance-begin/">launched</a> in April 2022, MNDE holders could participate by minting a <a href="https://marinade.finance/blog/marinade-announces-the-launch-of-on-chain-dao-governance-thru-nfts/">Chef NFT</a>, with several tiers based on their amount of MNDE. Marinade governance initially leveraged the governance platform <a href="https://tribeca.so/gov/mnde/proposals">Tribeca</a>. However, in July 2023, Marinade governance migrated to <a href="https://app.realms.today/dao/MNDE">Realms</a>. The Chef NFTs were deprecated in favor of more traditional MNDE-based governance. To participate in governance, voters must lock up MNDE, which is then subject to a 30-day unlocking period.</p><p>Marinade relies on a set of <a href="https://docs.marinade.finance/marinade-protocol/security/multisig-governance">multisigs</a> to enact protocol changes. There is a 6/13 multisig containing parties from various Solana projects that controls contract-code upgrades. There’s also multisig containing five addresses controlled by the Marinade team that controls mSOL-SOL liquidity pool and other parameters. Lastly, Marinade uses a 4/7 multisig containing Marinade team members to control the Marinade Council Budget vault. When Marinade DAO approves budget proposals via governance, MNDE tokens are sent to the vault for distribution.</p><h2><strong>Protocol Usage and Key Metrics</strong></h2><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/539fb722978f46e3052d5a6a872c74befbce1e2e-6400x3472.png?w=800" /><p>Marinade Liquid grew quickly following its launch in August 2021, gaining over 7.3 million SOL in TVL within three months. Marinade Liquid TVL peaked at over 7.7 million SOL in January 2022. Despite the liquidity mining program, Marinade's growth stagnated in 2022, largely due to the end of the previous bull market. The bear market was especially exacerbated on Solana when FTX collapsed in early November. SOL’s price peaked on November 6, 2022, with the overall crypto market cap reaching its all-time high a few days later. DeFi activity on Solana fell notably following FTX’s collapse, reducing the demand for liquid staking solutions. Marinade Liquid’s TVL fell by around 1.3 million SOL in the month following the FTX collapse.</p><p>While Solana DeFi activity and the overall market have picked back up, Marinade Liquid’s TVL is still stagnant at 6.7 million SOL, or $1.2 billion. The lack of recent growth can be attributed to competition from new liquid staking protocols offering points and airdrop programs, detailed below.</p><p>However, Marinade as a whole has witnessed notable growth. Much of the growth has been driven by Marinade Native, whose TVL stands at 3.6 million SOL, or $630 million. Altogether, Marinade’s TVL is at 10.3 million SOL. With SOL’s rapid price appreciation since the beginning of Q4’23, Marinade’s TVL in USD has surged to $1.8 billion.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/47b2ff98cbc90dc9d866619e73e953107098f0de-6400x3596.png?w=800" /><p>Marinade delegates SOL to around 250 validators. <a href="https://dune.com/queries/3230950/5403701">Distribution</a> figures of Marinade’s delegated stake are the following:</p><ul><li>10 validators make up the top 33% of Marinade delegated stake.</li><li>32 validators make up the top 50% of Marinade delegated stake.</li><li>115 validators make up the top 90% of Marinade delegated stake.</li></ul><p>Before the latest delegation strategy <a href="https://forum.marinade.finance/t/mdao-proposal-delegation-strategy-revamp/469">upgrade</a> in March 2023, Marinade delegated to over 450 validators. At the time, around 350 validators were receiving less than 10,000 SOL from Marinade. With the fall in SOL’s price following the FTX collapse, this amount of SOL staked was deemed no longer sufficiently beneficial to validators. Thus, Marinade limited the number of validators in the automated delegation strategy set to 100. As noted above, the planned delegation update aims to increase this limit.</p><p>With the recent uptick in Solana network activity, mSOL APY is up to around 7.4%. For reference, SOL’s annualized inflation rate is at 5.4%. The mSOL APY figure is calculated based on mSOL’s “true price,” i.e., SOL in Marinade staking pool / mSOL minted.</p><p>mSOL’s market price can deviate from its “true price” based on market conditions and available liquidity. An example of this occurred on December 12, 2023, when an address <a href="https://twitter.com/ponzirespecter/status/1734634673051951368">sold</a> around $8 million of mSOL, causing its price to <a href="https://twitter.com/0xMert_/status/1734628374209786169">dip</a> below SOL’s due to insufficient liquidity. Marinade is in the process of integrating with <a href="https://twitter.com/sanctumso">Sanctum</a>, which offers a <a href="https://learn.sanctum.so/docs/docs/our-roadmap">unified liquidity pool</a> and <a href="https://learn.sanctum.so/docs/reserve-pool">reserve</a> for Solana liquid staking protocols.</p><p>LST looping has been a popular strategy to amplify staking yields, although it brings a higher risk. The process involves recursively borrowing the native network token against one of its LSTs. Several emerging protocols enable users to deploy this strategy using mSOL with one click, including <a href="https://www.superstakesol.com/">Super Stake SOL</a>, powered by Drift’s borrow/lend protocol, and <a href="https://app.kamino.finance/lending/multiply">Kamino Multiply</a>.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/beb695eef2c858588c0fe6762f409a19e1ca0e9f-6432x3596.png?w=800" /><p>MNDE has a market cap of $88 million, ranking it 517th among all tokens. There has been a strong correlation between MNDE’s market cap and fees paid when denominated in USD. Both figures have seen growth since the beginning of Q4’23. Marinade has collected over $1.2 million in <a href="https://dune.com/queries/3232325/5406617">fees</a> in the past year. Around 90% of these fees have come from management fees, with the remaining from instant unstake fees. With most fees coming from Marinade Liquid management fees, fees paid denominated in SOL follow a similar trend to Marinade Liquid TVL: staying relatively flat since the beginning of 2022. Beyond SOL price appreciation and Marinade Liquid TVL growth, Marinade could increase its fees collected by beginning to monetize Marinade Native.</p><h2><strong>Competitive Landscape</strong></h2><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/ad5207f6794b5c54d56eb5255a9847e5f26b1738-6400x3468.png?w=800" /><p>Marinade was the first liquid staking protocol on Solana. From its launch until September 12, 2023, Marinade had maintained a majority share of Solana liquid staking TVL. The other main liquid staking protocol throughout that period was Lido, which <a href="https://blog.lido.fi/sunset-lido-on-solana/">sunsetted</a> its Solana instance in early October 2023. However, in the second half of 2023, several newer protocols began gaining traction, driven by points programs for airdrops.</p><p>Jito <a href="https://twitter.com/jito_sol/status/1702396552332058919">introduced</a> its points system in mid-September, which was then used as criteria for its early December <a href="https://twitter.com/jito_sol/status/1732794280618668363">airdrop</a>. Jito’s liquid staking protocol launched in November 2022, along with its MEV-optimized fork of the Solana Labs validator. Jito only delegates to validators that run the Jito MEV client. While Marinade doesn’t share this restriction, most validators in Marinade’s set still run the client. Since its airdrop, Jito has surpassed Marinade in liquid staking TVL, at 9.2 million SOL to 6.9 million SOL, respectively. JTO’s market cap is almost $375 million.</p><p>Similarly, SolBlaze <a href="https://twitter.com/solblaze_org/status/1688480225255161856">launched</a> its points system in early August, soon after launching its token BLZE and began <a href="https://twitter.com/solblaze_org/status/1692227422387867728">airdropping</a> it to points holders. Of the total BLZE supply, 64.5% is being airdropped to users through the initial airdrop and ongoing rewards. SolBlaze has amassed 2.7 million SOL TVL.</p><p>At the end of September, lending protocol MarginFi <a href="https://twitter.com/marginfi/status/1706690880093221119">launched</a> its own LST, aptly named LST. The LST routes stake to three validators run by the MarginFi team, <a href="https://twitter.com/mrgnalt/status/1707436923738833237">differentiating</a> by trading off decentralization for a <a href="https://twitter.com/ponzirespecter/status/1708586122274549872">higher</a> staking yield. MarginFi also recently <a href="https://twitter.com/marginfi/status/1762865889035317679">released</a> the whitepaper for stablecoin YBX, which will be backed by jitoSOL, mSOL, bSOL, and LST.</p><p>With the increase in Solana network activity, total <a href="https://dune.com/queries/3227834/5397784">base and priority fees</a> have risen notably. Validators typically do not distribute these fees to stakers. In the past, this has not mattered much as fees made up around 1% of <a href="https://dune.com/queries/3262652/5462544">total rewards</a> when combined with inflationary staking rewards. During Epoch 389, from March 14 to March 16, fees made up over 11% of total rewards. The increase led some single-validator LSTs like <a href="https://twitter.com/laine_sa_/status/1752976894780215566">laineSOL</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/knox_trades/status/1761364550845141455">jucySOL</a> to airdrop back a portion of these fees, raising their APYs above the standard 7-8% of other stake pools.</p><p>Sanctum is building a unified liquidity layer for Solana LSTs. It recently <a href="https://twitter.com/sanctumso/status/1765137015748563441">launched</a> the <a href="https://learn.sanctum.so/blog/understanding-sanctum/all-posts/a-deep-dive-into-the-economics-of-sanctum-infinity">Infinity</a> protocol and the INF LST (previously scnSOL). Sanctum Infinity Pool is a multi-LST liquidity pool containing 22 LSTs, including mSOL. By allowing any LST to tap into another’s liquidity, Sanctum may prevent the monopolistic/oligopolistic market structures that have arisen in other liquid staking ecosystems such as Ethereum. Thus, while Sanctum benefits Marinade by increasing liquidity for mSOL, it may also disadvantage Marinade as one of the market leaders. However, as MetaDAO notes in its <a href="https://hackmd.io/@metaproph3t/SJ1fMUlOT?utm_source=preview-mode&amp;utm_medium=rec">report</a> for Marinade, Marinade’s PSR feature could provide a defensible moat for it over new entrants: a validator would be less likely to provide a bond for a liquid staking protocol that is not yet delegating them a meaningful amount of SOL.</p><p>Marinade Liquid maintains a 34% market share among Solana liquid staking protocols. Its drop in market share has largely come from the growth of the Solana liquid staking pie rather than Marinade Liquid losing TVL. For perspective, Solana’s liquid staking rate began 2023 at 2.6% and currently stands at almost 5%.</p><p>Marinade differentiates itself by also having a native staking product. For reference, when grouped with liquid staking protocols, Marinade Native has a 16% market share. With Marinade Native's early success in attracting stake, Marinade DAO may explore strategies to monetize the product.</p><h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2><p>Marinade was the first liquid staking solution on Solana. Since its August 2021 launch, it has amassed 6.7 million SOL ($1.2 billion as of March 15, 2024) in liquid staking TVL, but growth has stagnated since the end of 2021 due to the bear market and more competition. However, Marinade as a whole has continued to grow with the launch of Marinade Native, a native staking solution. Since its July 2023 launch, Marinade Native has gained 3.6 million SOL in TVL ($630 million as of March 15, 2024). The continued rollout of Protected Staking Rewards and the upcoming delegation strategy upgrade will allow Marinade to expand the number of validators it delegates to without sacrificing performance. With updates like these already well underway, Marinade is well-poised to capitalize on the recent momentum in the Solana ecosystem.</p></div>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：
这些信息是积极的。Syscoin是一个开源、去中心化的开发平台，旨在结合比特币的PoW安全性和以太坊的可编程性。其模块化设计支持EVM rollups和其他Layer-2扩展技术。Syscoin的生态和用户群主要发展在Rollux L2上，其由Syscoin L1提供基础设施支持。Rollux是一个基于Optimism的分叉，旨在实现快速、低成本的微交易，同时确保高价值用例的安全性。通过零知识证明和基于ZK的SYS轻客户端，zkDA被建立，旨在扩展到其他链上。Syscoin的技术路线图包括增长策略和潜在风险，如合并挖矿和奖励结构。Syscoin仍需提高开发者和用户采用率，以实现在加密领域的成功。 <div>

There has been a constant battle to bring efficient throughput, cheap transaction fees, and speed amongst protocols, even during market downtrends. Last year alone, scaling solutions and new Proof-of-Stake (PoS) chains have raised <a href="https://messari.io/fundraising-data">over</a> $2 billion in private funding.</p><p>Syscoin is notable for its evolution over the past nine years. It was the first protocol to combine Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work network with the flexibility of EVM-equivalence within a modular architecture that fully supports rollups with a native data availability protocol. Syscoin’s goal is to provide decentralized technology and infrastructure that can scale to future demands in mass adoption scenarios. In January 2024, it took significant steps forward to the end, launching zero-knowledge data availability (zkDA) functionality to extend its offering to other blockchains and rollups</p><p>The project has completed both the base-layer infrastructure and the deployment of a scalable L2 called Rollux. This layer already shows a growing ecosystem of DeFi protocols, tools, and applications. Enterprises such as SYS Labs are focused on launching new applications and products designed to leverage Rollux and additional fractal scaling or application layers on top of Syscoin.</p><h2>Background</h2><p>Syscoin mainnet launched in 2014 as a fork of Litecoin. It aimed to enhance the capabilities of a traditional PoW chain by enabling features like “aliases” (decentralized identity), “certificates” (NFTs), and a working onchain decentralized marketplace. Dan Wasyluk and Sebastian Schepis initially led the project.</p><p>In 2015, Lead Core Developer and now Foundation President Jagdeep Sidhu joined the project. He shifted the project’s primary focus toward solving the bigger challenge of blockchain scalability rather than offering hardcoded smart contracts that would inevitably hit limits. Syscoin has been supported by the Syscoin Foundation, an organization created in 2016 by Syscoin’s <a href="https://syscoin.org/about">core team</a>, which includes <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jagdeep-sidhu-2a7bb76b/">Jagdeep Sidhu</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/willyko/">Willy Ko</a>.</p><p>The project had a <a href="https://messari.io/asset/syscoin/profile/launch-and-initial-token-distribution">public token sale</a> in 2014, selling 15% of the initial token supply for over 1,500 BTC, worth around $300,000 at the time. However, the BTC raised during the sale was <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/former-moolah-ceo-alex-green-aka-ryan-kennedy-arrested-uk/">stolen</a> by the escrow agent, Ryan Kennedy, the former CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange Moolah. The funds were not recovered. Despite this obstacle, the project team continued developing Syscoin and successfully delivered the product reflected in its initial proposal.</p><p>Syscoin progressed by revamping its platform and product offerings by developing Syscoin 2.0 and 3.0 between 2017 and 2019. Within that period, the team introduced various technical updates, such as transitioning the network’s Scrypt-based chain to SHA-256 with merged mining, integrating customized <a href="https://docs.syscoin.org/docs/tech/sentrynodes">Sentry nodes</a>, and developing the <a href="https://docs.syscoin.org/docs/tech/z-dag">Zero-confirmation Directed Acyclic Graph (Z-DAG)</a> scalability upgrade.</p><p>In May 2019, the Syscoin project team <a href="https://syscoin.org/news/syscoin-40-launch-date-confirmed">announced</a> the launch of the Syscoin 4.0 mainnet which would include a number of upgrades including Taproot. These events led up to the introduction of Syscoin’s Network-Enhanced Virtual Machine (NEVM), brought live to mainnet on Dec. 6, 2021, in version 4.3. Immediately afterwards, Syscoin Foundation began focusing on the next steps: enshrining data availability within the Syscoin protocol.</p><p>Once the coding of <a href="https://docs.rollux.com/docs/sys/PoDA/">Proof of Data Availability</a> (PoDA) began in 2022, SYS Labs was formed and was eventually registered in the UAE. The new enterprise began coordinating with Syscoin Foundation to develop the ecosystem’s first rollup. The rollup became known as Rollux and would be based on Optimism yet with additional functionality enabling it to run on top of Syscoin and to leverage PoDA. On March 13, 2023, Syscoin Foundation <a href="https://syscoin.org/news/syscoin-releases-poda-nearing-rollux-launch">announced the mainnet release of PoDA</a>. Shortly after, <a href="https://syscoin.org/news/rollux-begins-liftoff">the final testnet deployment of Rollux was announced</a>, followed by <a href="https://x.com/RolluxL2/status/1674055458070437890">the mainnet release</a> on June 28, 2023.</p><h2>Technology</h2><h3>Network Architecture</h3><p></p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/24c550ad9916cb049e9c7c2f64052a72eaad7a15-3840x2464.png?w=800" /><p>The Syscoin L1 is a dual-chain architecture, featuring a PoW base chain and an EVM-compatible chain (NEVM), which are integrated within the Syscoin protocol. The foundational chain is UTXO-based like Bitcoin and runs on a merge-mined consensus mechanism, tying its security to Bitcoin. The NEVM chain provides EVM-compatible execution, such as smart contract deployment and interoperability with other EVM networks.<br /></p><h4>Base Chain (UTXO)</h4><p>The base chain houses Syscoin’s merge-mined PoW layer. The Syscoin network can leverage hashpower from Bitcoin’s own network through the process known as merged mining. Merged mining allows miners to mine multiple blockchains simultaneously via <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Merged_mining_specification">Auxillary Proof-of-Work (AuxPoW)</a>. For Syscoin, the Bitcoin chain acts as the “parent chain” to a miner and allocates hashpower, while Syscoin performs the role of the “auxiliary chain.” Therefore, by aligning its algorithm with Bitcoin’s (SHA-256), Syscoin can utilize Bitcoin miners’ hash power. Currently, over 50% of the Bitcoin mining hash power is used to mine Syscoin blocks, as can be seen by comparing the <a href="https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/bitcoin/hashrate-chart">Bitcoin</a> and <a href="https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/syscoin/hashrate-chart">Syscoin</a> hashrate charts. Miners on the base chain interact with the Operating System layer or NEVM by publishing completed Syscoin blocks to the NEVM.</p><p></p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/378fa292e7f8b87963a9376d82d31761c3268af2-1044x1044.jpg?w=800" /><p><em>Source: </em><a href="https://docs.rollux.com/docs/sys/PoDA/#hash-based-blobs&amp;gid=1&amp;pid=2">Syscoin Docs</a></p><p>As of March 23, 2023, the Syscoin base chain also provides a native data availability protocol and associated fee market called <a href="https://docs.rollux.com/docs/sys/PoDA/">Proof of Data Availability</a> (PoDA). PoDA is designed to support any kind of rollup, including optimistic and ZK-based ones, and it can be used by both EVM and non-EVM systems. While PoDA serves the same basic purpose as Ethereum’s proto-danksharding (<a href="https://www.eip4844.com/">EIP-4844</a>), it differs in regards to how data is stored, presented, and pruned, as well as in how fees are calculated. For example, PoDA uses <a href="https://keccak.team/keccak.html">Keccak cryptography</a> instead of KZG polynomial commitments required in Ethereum’s danksharding design.</p><p>Additionally, unlike a traditional UTXO network such as Bitcoin, users can mint fungible and non-fungible <a href="https://docs.syscoin.org/docs/tech/tokens/">Syscoin Platform Tokens</a> (SPTs) on the Syscoin base chain, which are UTXO-based tokens. The base chain also includes Taproot functionality identical to that of Bitcoin, and as such, Bitcoin-style ordinals can be created and transferred.<br /></p><h4>Operating System Chain</h4><p><a href="https://docs.syscoin.org/docs/tech/nevm/">Syscoin NEVM</a> is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chain where smart contracts can be created and deployed. NEVM works in sync with Syscoin’s base chain layer. This is achieved by pushing the tip hash generated on the NEVM into Syscoin’s base chain blocks. Users on NEVM can mint EVM-compatible tokens, execute smart contracts, and bridge to the ecosystem’s L2 EVM rollup, Rollux. Any token standards supported by Ethereum are also supported by NEVM (ERC-20, 721, 1155, etc.).</p><p>The NEVM relies on the PoW base chain for consensus and settlement. Block hashes from the NEVM are included in base chain blocks. By interlinking these chains, Syscoin provides a single Layer-1 that leverages traditional PoW network security and Ethereum’s smart contract capability. Of note, SYS is the native coin of both chains, and its supply can be automatically bridged between both chains by users via a mechanism that uses SPV proofs to mint/burn.<br /></p><h4>Rollux: A Rollup for Scalable Execution by Applications</h4><p>Having delivered on its modular tech stack roadmap (including the data availability protocol discussed later in this report, and the Rollux L2), Syscoin Foundation, aided by SYS Labs, is now focused on supporting and expanding its L2 ecosystem. It’s also seeking to participate in joint research and development on ZK-based solutions involving light clients, cross-chain technologies, and application-specific rollups that include non-EVM runtimes.</p><p></p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/7669fea9c17c4864ae1d311699024766c2bf5fc5-1600x900.png?w=800" /><p>So far, Syscoin has faced challenges with user and developer adoption due to the slower speed of its security-focused Layer-1 and the lack of an available Layer-2. Regardless, the team has stuck to its modular design principles and has since deployed the Rollux L2. Rollux now features an <a href="https://rollux.com/ecosystem">emerging ecosystem</a> of applications and protocols that could make SYS competitive. <a href="https://syslabs.com">SYS Labs</a>, an enterprise, is developing several products in addition to Rollux that will be deployed within the ecosystem, in addition to independent onboarding and integrations now seen within the ecosystem.</p><h3>Consensus Mechanism</h3><h4>Participants</h4><p><strong>Miners</strong></p><p>Miners participate in merged mining with Bitcoin, which provides Syscoin’s security and base-chain consensus mechanism. Miners interact with the Operating System layer or NEVM by publishing completed Syscoin blocks to the network and are rewarded in SYS.</p><p><strong>Sentry Nodes</strong></p><p>Syscoin <a href="https://docs.syscoin.org/docs/tech/sentrynodes">Sentry Nodes</a> are incentivized full nodes for both the base and NEVM chains, operating on the same machine and providing a second layer of services to the network. Apart from recording and hosting full copies of the network’s state, Syscoin Sentry nodes provide a <a href="https://chainz.cryptoid.info/sys/masternodes.dws">decentralized means of finality</a> through multi-quorum chainlocks via BLS signatures. The Syscoin team intentionally designed this structure to stay true to their core belief in PoW blockchains. Rather than relegating back to a pure PoS system, Syscoin uses these nodes for finality through a <a href="https://syscoin.medium.com/revealing-the-method-in-the-madness-ee9b2b619fd8#:~:text=Finality%20%E2%80%94%20Multi%2DQuorum%20Chainlocks">carefully thought-out process of chainlocks</a>.</p><p>Syscoin’s finality is an additive security on top of the Nakamoto PoW consensus. It makes merged mining safer by creating resistance, yet the chain and network will also continue in its absence. Unlike Dash and many other networks that utilize masternodes, Syscoin’s Sentry nodes do not serve as a subset of trusted validators. Instead, Syscoin’s network prioritizes decentralization by maintaining the same approach as Bitcoin, where all full nodes verify before trusting. Aside from participating in finality quorums and decentralized governance, Syscoin Sentry nodes serve the same role as any standard full node.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/eff4631dcc3a1fb9145d9ef83a4e02fb19504b79-1600x791.jpg?w=800" /><p><em>Source: </em><a href="https://sysnode.info/stats">Sysnode.info</a></p><p>Sentry nodes need to stake 100,000 SYS to participate in supporting network functionality. It should be noted that the collateral required to operate a Sentry node stays in the owner’s self-custody, and it can be unstaked at any time and moved to a new address by its owner. However, moving it eliminates the seniority Sentry node owners earn. Seniority incentivizes Sentry node operators to keep their nodes running and their collateral in place by rewarding additional SYS. The rewards are doled out first after one year and then reach full maturity after 2.5 years, which brings a 100% bonus over the base rewards. Currently, <a href="https://syscoin.org/masternodes#:~:text=Today%2C%20over%2050%25%20of%20masternodes%20serving%20our%20network%20have%20been%20active%20for%20longer%20than%202.5%20years.">nearly half</a> of Syscoin’s ~2,700 Sentry nodes are operating at full maturity (over 2.5 years). Hardware requirements for setting up a Syscoin Sentry node can be found <a href="https://docs.syscoin.org/docs/guides/sentrynode_setup">here</a>. APR and other income-focused metrics can be found <a href="https://sysnode.info/stats">here</a>.</p><h3>Mechanism</h3><p>The Syscoin base layer inherits Bitcoin’s own security via <a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/merged-mining">merged mining</a>. Merged mining was <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1790.msg28696#msg28696">proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto</a> and made part of Bitcoin Core in 2010. It enables Bitcoin miners to mine multiple cryptocurrencies by simultaneously providing their hash power to numerous blockchains, without incurring additional energy expenses beyond what they already spend to support Bitcoin. At the time of this research, Syscoin is inheriting around 60% of Bitcoin's own hashrate, as seen by comparing the ratio of hashrates of <a href="https://miningpoolstats.stream/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> and <a href="https://miningpoolstats.stream/syscoin">Syscoin</a>.</p><p>By providing its own native EIP1559-based utility coin (SYS) to Bitcoin miners, Syscoin incentivizes them to continue supporting Bitcoin in the face of Bitcoin’s diminishing block rewards and static fees. SYS has similar utility-focused economics as ETH, thus it does not intrude upon BTC’s economics.</p><p>In effect, merged mining allows miners to mine multiple blockchains simultaneously via <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Merged_mining_specification">Auxiliary Proof-of-Work (AuxPoW)</a>. <a href="https://www.n-able.com/blog/sha-256-encryption#:~:text=SHA%2D256%20is%20a%20patented,as%20long%20as%20when%20unencrypted.">SHA-256</a>-compliant projects such as <a href="https://rootstock.io/">Rootstock</a> and <a href="https://www.namecoin.org/">Namecoin</a> utilize merged mining with the Bitcoin network. Furthermore, any PoW blockchain can utilize merge-mining, with one example being Dogecoin merge-mined with Litecoin. AuxPoW incorporates a “parent chain” that allocates hashpower to auxiliary chains. An added benefit of this approach is that merge-mining does not require additional mining resources, making it effectively the only carbon-neutral form of PoW.</p><p>In Syscoin’s case, Bitcoin acts as the “parent chain.” As such, Bitcoin miners can choose to allocate hashpower to Syscoin’s PoW chain and mine both Bitcoin and Syscoin simultaneously without committing additional resources.</p><h3>Multi-Quorum Finality</h3><p>Since the number of miners participating in mining SYS is smaller than Bitcoin’s entire network of miners, the possibility of a 51% attack increases. In a 51% network attack, malicious miners can control which blocks will be mined, interrupting the network and preventing honest miners from completing new blocks. Therefore, Syscoin leverages chainlocks, a mechanism first <a href="https://www.dash.org/news/chainlocks/">introduced </a>by Dash, to increase its security. Syscoin’s particular implementation of chainlocks relies on multiple Long Living Masternode Quorums (LLMQs) that decide on the next block to be mined. Thereby providing a second layer of verifying the correct order of block mining, Syscoin greatly mitigates the risk of a successful 51% attack, given that finality prevents selfish mining concerns. Miners would only be able to selfishly mine within the finality window (5 blocks), or else they’d be forced to restart their work and compete with the other Bitcoin miners on the Bitcoin network to mine 5 blocks before anyone else can mine 1 block).</p><p>These chainlocks are established at a relatively high degree of Nakamoto coefficient. The mechanism involves four separate quorums, each consisting of 400 randomly selected Sentry nodes (1,600 in total), which are reformed periodically. This same mechanism also serves to provide finality for smart contracts on NEVM and the Rollux L2. In order for a 51% attacker to succeed, they would have to control over 50% of the portion of Bitcoin’s hashrate supporting Syscoin and control a supermajority (60%+) of Syscoin Sentry nodes. Due to the validators and finality, there is an additional risk of halting a chain by voting on invalid block headers. But, Syscoin averts this problem by allowing this condition to have finality fall back to the previous chainlock in said scenario.</p><p>This finality is a core component of the ZK light client for Syscoin’s zkDA. It will enable Syscoin to validate the DA’s existence and prevent the SYS chain from rolling back from its DA inclusion. This feature will allow optimistic rollups to be incorporated, given that they require determinism to be included.</p><p><br /><br /></p><h3>Scaling Features</h3><h4>Base Chain Scaling: Z-DAG</h4><p>Before launching the NEVM chain, the Syscoin team aimed to add transaction scaling features to its base chain PoW layer. One of these features was Zero-confirmation Directed Acyclic Graph or <a href="https://docs.syscoin.org/docs/tech/z-dag/">Z-DAG</a>. Z-DAG is a throughput scalability solution created by Syscoin’s Lead Developer, Jag Sidhu. It is used to support asset transactions on Syscoin’s base UTXO chain. Syscoin engineered Z-DAG as a redundancy protocol to the existing transaction settlement mechanism provided by PoW. This allows transactions broadcasted to the network to be relayed to their destination before requiring verification, providing peer-to-peer “fast transactions” or “micro transactions” of SPTs, including the native token, SYS, on the Syscoin base chain. Z-DAG aims to become a <a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dl8wrczbj/image/upload/v1628251926/HouseofChimera/Report-PDFs/Syscoin-Paper-August_iceisl.pdf">viable option</a> for scaling simple value transactions, given that it can exceed the throughput of major credit card processors like Visa and MasterCard.</p><h4>Syscoin Bridge</h4><p>The Syscoin bridge operates as a two-way mechanism between its native blockchain and the NEVM platform that utilizes Syscoin Platform Tokens (SPT) as intermediaries. The process begins by burning of SYS tokens on the native blockchain and then issuing an equivalent amount of SYSX (SPT) tokens. These SYSX tokens are then locked within the bridge's infrastructure to prevent double-spending. Next, the same amount in SYS tokens in ERC-20 format is minted on the NEVM.</p><p>The same process works in reverse: burning the SYS ERC-20 tokens on the NEVM, unlocking the equivalent amount of SYSX on the Syscoin blockchain, and restoring the SYS tokens on the Syscoin network. This structure aims to maintain a constant total supply of SYS across both blockchains and to tap into Ethereum’s ecosystem.</p><p>Of note, the team has stated that SPT tokens could also be bridged to the NEVM via the Syscoin bridge. However, users must refer to Syscoin bridge <a href="https://github.com/syscoin/sysethereum-contracts">contracts</a> to enable specific bridging of non-SYS tokens. According to the <a href="https://github.com/syscoin/sysethereum-docs">documentation</a>, the bridge is a “non-custodial” implementation where a bridge operator does not manage tokens during the process.</p><h2>Tokenomics</h2><h3>SYS Utility and Features</h3><p>Syscoin’s native utility token, SYS, is used for payments, gas fees, and network security (Sentry node staking and miner block rewards).</p><h3>SYS Distribution</h3><p>Upon launch of the network’s mainnet in 2014, SYS initially had a max supply of 2 billion tokens. More recently in 2021, the SYS supply has since been updated with the integration of <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559">EIP-1559</a>, is currently uncapped, and is <a href="https://syscoin.org/news/nevm-and-related-changes-to-syscoin">estimated</a> to have an inflationary rate of 1.25% per year. The breakdown of the token’s distribution will take into account the current state of the SYS supply:</p><ul><li>Initial distribution: A total of <a href="https://github.com/syscoin/syscoin1/blob/master/src/main.cpp">364 million SYS</a> was mined and distributed upon the mainnet deployment of Syscoin V1 on August 17, 2014, primarily to pre-sale participants. At that time, with SYS max supply capped at 2 billion, this represented 18% of the max supply. In terms of today’s circulating supply it represents 48%. Based upon the average pre-sale purchase price of SYS at ~490 satoshis (0.0000049 BTC) with Bitcoin trading around $510 USD, the total value of the distribution is estimated at ~$910k USD.&nbsp; Allocations were as follows (with estimated value):<ul><li>Public token sale: 304,222,858 SYS ($760,252 USD)</li><li>Development, marketing, and operations: 40 million SYS ($99,960 USD)</li><li>Bounties and rewards: 20 million SYS ($49,980 USD)</li></ul></li><li>Base chain block rewards: At launch, 96.25 SYS was minted for each base chain block, with that amount decreasing by 5% yearly and an additional yearly reward halving. Notably, 90% of base chain block rewards go to consensus participants. Of the 90%, 25% go to miners, and 75% go to Sentry nodes. The remaining 10% is allocated towards decentralized governance that functions the same as Dash governance. Governance funds are emitted in monthly superblocks to fund proposals ratified by Sentry node voters. Superblock funding similarly diminishes over time and details can be seen <a href="https://sysnode.info/governance">here</a>.</li><li>NEVM block rewards: Only <a href="https://syscoin.org/news/nevm-and-related-changes-to-syscoin">miners</a> participating in merged mining and contributing to the Syscoin base chain layer can earn NEVM block rewards. NEVM block rewards are emitted at a constant rate of 10.55 SYS per block processed on the NEVM layer. Of note, NEVM block rewards are generated on the NEVM chain.</li><li>Transaction fees: Transaction fees across the base chain and NEVM are sent to miners and Sentry node operators in a 50/50 split. Of note, the project team has implemented <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559">EIP-1559</a>, introduced by Ethereum in 2019, which enforces a fee-burning <a href="https://consensys.net/blog/quorum/what-is-eip-1559-how-will-it-change-ethereum/">mechanism</a> for gas fees paid by users and/or smart contract deployments.</li></ul><p>Just prior to the release of NEVM, in October 2021, the Syscoin Foundation proposed a Treasury Fund to governance participants. After the proposal <a href="https://syscoin.org/file/syscoinfoundation-nevmrelease-treasuryfundsubstantiation.pdf">passed</a>, 100 million SYS tokens (~14.8% of the total circulating supply at that time) were minted. They have been allocated to fund the continued development of the Syscoin network at the <a href="https://messari.io/organization/syscoin-foundation">Syscoin Foundation’s</a> discretion. A breakdown of the treasury allocations includes:</p><ul><li>65 million SYS (~9.7% of the total circulating supply) has been allocated towards general core team funding and project onboarding/integrations.</li><li>35 million SYS (~5.2% of the total circulating supply) has been allocated towards future VC/private funding rounds.</li></ul><h2>Network Activity</h2><p></p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/98e27d6bafe4070ef2d37a3f8fe3d4ee94ce23e4-1307x613.png?w=800" /><p>In terms of <a href="https://explorer.syscoin.org/">network activity</a>, Syscoin still has a significant road to cover compared to its peers. Active wallets on the Syscoin NEVM total just <a href="https://explorer.syscoin.org/">over</a> 40,000, and over 200 tokens have been <a href="https://explorer.syscoin.org/tokens?holder_count=1&amp;items_count=200&amp;name=blockmarket">launched</a>/created on the network. To give a frame of reference, Ethereum has over 219 million wallets. Syscoin’s L2, Rollux has seen more network activity, averaging over <a href="https://explorer.rollux.com/">50,000 daily transactions</a> in the last month.</p><h2>The Road Ahead</h2><h3>Growth Strategies</h3><p>According to the Syscoin 4.0 Whitepaper, one of Syscoin’s main focuses is developing more scaling solutions. Syscoin has gone through multiple technical upgrades and iterations over the years. Although the project has been heavily focused on developing its underlying tech stack, integrating the NEVM and future scaling upgrades (PoDA and rollups) indicates a new step in the protocol’s evolution.</p><p>The Syscoin 4.0 Whitepaper also describes the integration of SDK and Application Layers. The SDK layer supports scalability solutions such as <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/zk-rollups/#:~:text=ZK%2Drollups%20are%20%22hybrid%20scaling,update%20to%20the%20rollup's%20state.">ZK-rollups</a> for the NEVM and an Application Layer allowing applications to be built on the SDK Layer. With these additions, the team has increased transaction speed, lowered costs, and increased scalability for users and developers. As of today, the project has adopted <a href="https://syscoin.org/rollux">Rollux</a> as the network’s first rollup on the SDK layer. Rollux is a scaling solution based on a fork of the <a href="https://www.optimism.io/">Optimism</a> network <a href="https://github.com/sys-labs/rollux/commit/25a4c9410ddae31ff7195f67495491f71e684e03">refactored to utilize Syscoin’s PoDA protocol</a>. It is currently live on mainnet.</p><p>Below is the four-layer tech stack for Syscoin per the <a href="https://syscoin.org/file/syscoin4-whitepaper.pdf">Syscoin 4.0 Whitepaper</a></p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/60f08ab9959cc48e760477e68f84181eb9a6abc9-3840x3832.png?w=800" /><p></p><p>Additionally, the team <a href="https://syscoin.org/news/syscoin-poda-is-live-on-the-tanenbaum-network">announced</a> the release of a dedicated data availability protocol named PoDA (Proof of Data Availability) for securing the SDK layer. Data availability allows nodes on a network to gain access to data contained within all rollup or L2 blocks. This, in turn, mitigates potential security risks if a block producer for a rollup or other L2 refuses to make transaction data available which would compromise the integrity of the data verified by nodes. Data availability services typically aim to operate with the same security assumptions as the L1 chain where rollup users would move their funds if they were to exit the rollup. Syscoin’s PoDA directly fulfills this demand. Also, Rollux gains this benefit at a low cost rather than turning to third-party data availability providers to cut costs. Doing so mitigates the risk of extra security assumptions that reside outside the domain of the L1. Like Rollux, rollups that use Syscoin as their L1 through PoDA would also gain this benefit.</p><p>Protocols such as Celestia aim to provide data availability to other chains. With Syscoin’s recent zkDA launch, it has staked its offering on an in-house data availability layer rather than relying on third-party ones. With this, the team has introduced the ability for further throughput scalability to its rollup-centric SDK layer. This DA is also designed to serve L3s and other successive application layers, or “fractal layers,” that are built on top of the Rollux L2.<br /></p><p>Ultimately, the team aims to have Syscoin serve as the go-to, BTC-secured DA layer for other chains. As such, Syscoin has been developing a BTC-based mechanism similar to re-staking. It aims to give crypto-economic security to the Bitcoin L2 community and others, akin to what Eigen Layer provides to the Ethereum community. These features might appeal to emerging Bitcoin L2 projects, which currently depend upon third-party DA and various MPC/multi-signature agreements for bridging BTC.&nbsp; Additionally, Syscoin’s offerings could appeal to projects seeking the security and resilience guarantees of Bitcoin’s PoW rather than relying solely on PoS systems. While promising, it should be noted that these features are still under development.<br /></p><p>The project team also plans on promoting a user and developer-friendly environment, attracting more applications, traffic, and TVL to its network. The team states that in the near future they will execute a multi-pronged strategy that includes social-driven advertising, hackathons, and other events, as well as point-based campaigns. The end goal is to promote activity and TVL associated with SYS Labs’ several oncoming DeFi protocols, applications, and offerings. The Syscoin Foundation treasury is also used to foster the ecosystem and increase the number of projects onboarding to the network. Ultimately, the aim is for these projects to gain independent funding, in the same way that <a href="https://superdapp.ai">SuperDapp</a> managed to recently.<br /></p><p>They also hope to implement their DAOSYS DeFi framework, providing an autonomous service engine to help developers create their own treasuries/DAOs to fund projects. It uses a concept roughly similar to Alchemix’s “self-repaying loans” but more focused on ecosystem growth.</p><p>The same new DeFi primitive in DAOSYS, which SYS Labs coins as ”<a href="https://pachira.finance/Pachira_One_Pager.pdf">liquidity trees</a>,” is expected to have a separate implementation in a SYS Labs product called <a href="https://pachira.finance/">Pachira</a>. The end goal is to introduce more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEabq9uAmiM">capital efficiency for liquidity pool providers</a> as well as cross-chain functionality. Liquidity trees could even be complementary to Uniswap V3 and other CLMM liquidity pool protocols.</p><h3>Potential Risks and Roadblocks</h3><p>Syscoin still has a long way to go in terms of developer and user adoption compared to larger L1 networks. In its current state, Syscoin has some risks to consider, including its use of merged mining, its reward structure, and its lagging participation rate.</p><p>With its newly launched zkDA capabilities, Syscoin could face analogous perils to what <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/cross-chain-bridge-hacks-2022/">bridges have repeatedly faced over the years</a>. A keen analysis of the risks associated with bridges and interoperability will be instrumental in safeguarding the network as it expands to become the premium BTC-secured DA layer for other chains.</p><p>Per the <a href="https://syscoin.org/file/syscoin4-whitepaper.pdf">Syscoin 4.0 Whitepaper</a> tokenomics section, the project team has projected that rewards for miners participating in merged mining will reach near zero due to the rewards' deflationary nature. While rewards will never be fully eliminated, potential vulnerabilities to the network may arise with the reduction in miner incentives and, consequently, participation in maintaining the network’s security, as seen in other PoW blockchains.</p><p>Despite Syscoin’s ongoing network infrastructure developments, it has struggled to attract significant participation rate in developer onboarding, transaction volume, and user activity. An increase in transaction volume and developer activity on the network may introduce more incentivization methods for miners and Sentry nodes as the network evolves. To potentially raise those incentives in the future, the project must address the onboarding of projects and users to create a flywheel effect.</p><h2>Closing Summary</h2><p>Syscoin has undergone several updates, iterations, and tech stack changes. Although it may not have the adoption of its counterparts, the protocol’s technical updates offer a novel approach to creating an L1 blockchain. Projects such as <a href="https://babylonchain.io/">Babylon Chain</a> on the Cosmos Network have attempted to adopt merged mining, similar to Syscoin, and leverage Bitcoin’s network security to address issues with PoS chains.</p><p>With the launches of Rollux and zkDA, Syscoin has been able to close the gap with its competition in terms of features and services provided. Specifically, its zkDA offering aims to address the dual demands of security and efficiency in the data availability space. Several features, including the integration of zero-knowledge proofs, the advantages of Bitcoin's PoW mechanism, and its focus on timely data pruning, help position Syscoin as a unique competitor in the space. For Syscoin to continue closing this gap, it might seek out partnerships with applications across ecosystems (DeFi, NFTs, etc.). The project team will also need to prioritize onboarding developers to survive in one of the most competitive ecosystems in the space.</p></div>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。众议院金融服务委员会就CFPB规则展开了辩论，共和党批评规则模糊不清、反对创新，并超出了CFPB的权力范围。一些民主党人同意共和党关于规则不明确的说法，但委员会的民主党领导人认为该规则加强了消费者保护和银行与非银行之间的监管平等。此外，两名成员敦促SEC不再批准任何加密货币交易所交易产品。总统拜登在白宫的新预算提案中再次支持数字资产挖矿税和将洗钱交易规则应用于加密资产等税收方面的更新。 <div>
<p>The House Financial Services Committee debated a CFPB rule that could add further uncertainty to the digital asset space. Republicans criticized the rule as ambiguous, anti-innovation, and outside the CFPB's authority. While some Democrats appear in agreement with Republican claims that the rule is unclear, Democrat leadership on the Committee argued the rule bolsters consumer protections and regulatory parity between banks and nonbanks. In a new letter, two Members urged the SEC not to approve any more crypto ETPs. And in the White House's new budget proposal, President Biden is once again supporting a digital asset mining tax and crypto-related updates to the tax code, like applying wash sale rules to crypto assets.</p>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。Pyth网络价值高达55亿美元，支持162个协议上的加密货币、股票、外汇对、ETF和大宗商品的价格数据。Pyth在Solana上的交易占比例20%，数据提供者在2024年2月支付了22.5万美元的费用。Pyth的数据提供商包括知名机构交易商和DeFi协议。Pyth计划将其Solana推送Oracle完全迁移至新的Solana拉取Oracle。Pyth还将支持即将推出的基于以太坊的第一个基于SVM的Layer-2区块链Eclipse。 <div>
<div><h2><strong>Key Insights</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>Pyth <a href="https://defillama.com/oracles">secures</a> $5.5 billion in value</strong> and supports price feeds of cryptocurrencies, equities, foreign exchange pairs, ETFs, and commodities on 162 protocols across <a href="https://pyth.network/blog/pyth-price-feeds-launch-on-hedera">50+ blockchains</a><strong>.</strong></li><li><strong>In February 2024, Pyth oracle transactions accounted for an average of 20% of total Solana transactions;</strong> simultaneously, Pyth data providers paid $225,000 in fees on Solana in February 2024.</li><li>Pyth Network uses a network of first-party data providers that publish data directly to Solana and Pythnet (an appchain that serves Pyth oracle updates to all other blockchains). <strong>Data providers include institutional traders, renowned market makers, and notable DeFi protocols, such as Jane Street, CTC, and Raydium.</strong></li><li>By the end of Q2, <strong>Pyth plans to fully migrate its Solana push oracle to a new Solana pull oracle.</strong></li><li><strong>As Solana’s leading oracle, Pyth will support many of the applications expanding to and launching on Eclipse,</strong> the first SVM-based Layer-2 blockchain on Ethereum.</li></ul><h2>Background</h2><p>Blockchain applications often use data from the external world. However, the design of these systems restricts them from natively interacting with external data without help. As a resolution, blockchains rely on oracles to act as middlemen that aggregate external data and make it available for onchain application use.</p><p>Typically, oracle networks incentivize nodes to find certain information, come to a consensus on a value for particular data points, and publish such values to blockchains in set time periods. However, this “push” model can be indirect, expensive, and hard to scale. Pyth Network addresses these issues by fostering a network of primary source (first-party) data providers and coordinating a “pull” model. This model reduces latency, scales quickly, and lowers network costs by offloading update fees to data consumers (applications and developers).</p><p>Pyth (<a href="https://messari.io/project/pyth-network">PYTH</a>) is an oracle network that aims to offer accurate prices for cryptocurrencies, equities, foreign exchange pairs, ETFs, and commodities. It offers three core products:</p><ul><li><a href="https://pyth.network/price-feeds">Price Feeds</a> (live updates for smart contracts)</li><li><a href="https://pyth.network/benchmarks">Benchmarks</a> (historical market data)</li><li><a href="https://pyth.network/blog/secure-random-numbers-for-blockchains">Pyth Entropy</a> (secure random number generator)</li></ul><p>The robustness of Pyth’s data is largely due to its contributing publisher network, which comprises nearly <a href="https://pyth.network/publishers">100 data providers</a> from global exchanges, trading firms, market makers, institutions, and DeFi. A few notable providers include Jane Street, Chicago Trading Company (CTC), Binance, Raydium, Osmosis, Galaxy, and 0x. Pyth is focused on making financial market data available to developers on an expanding list of blockchain networks (<a href="https://pyth.network/blog/pyth-price-feeds-launch-on-hedera">50+ blockchains</a> as of writing).</p><p><a href="https://pyth.network/">Website</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/PythNetwork">X (Twitter)</a> / <a href="https://discord.com/invite/PythNetwork">Discord</a></p><h2>Technology</h2><p>In addition to bridging data between blockchains and the outside world, oracles strive to overcome the <a href="https://encyclopedia.pub/entry/2959">oracle problem</a>. The oracle problem refers to ensuring secure, authenticated, and trustworthy external data, while also considering the potential failures of external sources.</p><p>Addressing the oracle problem typically involves:</p><ul><li>Validators or oracle nodes sourcing data</li><li>Nodes cryptographically signing (verifying) the sourced data</li><li>Aggregation of the data and consensus of the calculated data point</li><li>Data transmission to the blockchain network</li></ul><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/082cf846315eca2ec4c0a38045809cf6e679ec74-3200x1800.png?w=800" /><p>The oracle problem is often addressed via a push or pull model. Most oracles use a third-party <strong><em>push model</em></strong>. In this model, oracle nodes are third parties that fetch data from either primary sources (i.e., exchanges) or secondary sources (i.e., data aggregators like CoinGecko and Kaiko). For instance, Chainlink’s primary price feed oracle nodes fetch data from <a href="https://chain.link/education/blockchain-oracles">secondary sources</a>. Push oracles push price updates to individual blockchains at set intervals, paying gas costs for every onchain update. Adding price feeds or decreasing latency between onchain updates incurs more costs for the oracle network, impeding its ability to scale. Additionally, fetching data requires multiple trust assumptions: the primary source is correct and stable; the secondary source is correct and stable; and the oracle network is stable.</p><p>Pyth Network confronts the shortcomings of the third-party push model with its <strong><em>pull model</em></strong>. Through its provider network of <a href="https://pyth.network/publishers">first-party data sources</a>, Pyth addresses the two downstream trust assumptions of third-party data reliability. In Pyth’s pull model, data is provided directly by in-network exchanges, market makers, and DeFi protocols, like Jane Street, Binance, and Raydium. These entities are incentivized to behave honestly and to provide robust data to maintain a good reputation and avoid being banned by the protocol.</p><p>The remaining benefits hinge on offloading costs to the end consumer, where price feeds are updated on-demand instead of according to set time intervals. Hence, consumers initiate price updates, <em>pulling</em> the updates onchain in the same DeFi transaction (i.e., swapping assets, settling a perpetual swap, etc.). By offloading costs to users where updates are demand-based, Pyth redirects these costs and scales efficiently, as seen in its frequent updates on <a href="https://pyth.network/price-feeds">451 price feeds</a>.</p><h3>Core Interactions</h3><p>Pyth runs two instances of its protocol: one on the Solana mainnet and the other on the Pythnet appchain. Pyth on Solana only serves data to protocols on Solana; Pyth on Pythnet serves data to protocols on all other blockchains. Three core entities interact with each other to facilitate oracle updates on Pyth Network in both instances:</p><ul><li>Data Providers/Publishers (Jane Street, CTC, Binance, 0x, Raydium, etc.)</li><li>The Pyth Oracle Program (aggregation algorithm)</li><li>Data Consumers (applications/developers)</li></ul><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/2a3dc6fa67dda6f258b494ebc82ecc3d640c8156-3200x1800.png?w=800" /><p>Data publishers are validators on Pythnet. Previously, the <a href="https://pythdataassociation.com/">Pyth Data Association</a> was responsible for delegating an adequate stake to the validators; however, with the launch of <a href="https://app.realms.today/dao/PYTH">governance</a>, this will now be managed by PYTH holders. As of writing, there are no proposals to change the dynamics of validator stake, which are currently all weighted equally. As the first-party suppliers of Pyth data, publishers are compensated by a small fee charged as a part of the entire DeFi transaction initiated by consumers.</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-client?tab=readme-ov-file#pyth-client">Pyth Oracle Program</a> is the aggregation algorithm that combines data submitted by publishers and produces an aggregate price and confidence interval for respective price feeds at the time of calculation. It’s also responsible for maintaining the price feeds, storing individual inputs from publishers, and performing additional computations like a moving average. Applications and developers are the consumers who request to update price feeds to read the information produced by the Oracle Program.</p><h3>Pyth on Solana</h3><p>Price feeds are represented as two Solana accounts: product and price accounts. Product accounts store metadata about the price feed, like ticker symbol, asset type, corresponding price account, etc. Price accounts contain the names of the authorized data providers, the prices and confidence intervals each provider submits, exponential moving averages, etc. Both accounts are maintained by the Oracle Program, which also contains a third account that essentially just lists product accounts. This setup enables applications to catalog the full list of price feeds offered by Pyth.</p><p>Price updates are submitted by publishers every 400 ms (the length of a time slot on Solana). Each update triggers frequent price and confidence interval aggregation updates to be used downstream in applications. (Because the Oracle Program stores the individual data values submitted by each publisher, publishers can be held accountable for poor performance or malicious actions.) Solana’s low costs enable Pyth —&nbsp;or any oracle — to run an efficient push model where developers simply pass the relevant price feed to their application, deserialize the data, and read/integrate the already published value.</p><p><em>Of note: By the end of Q2, Pyth plans to fully migrate its Solana push oracle to a new Solana pull oracle. Through <a href="https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/target_chains/solana">development channels</a>, the Pyth team has noted that the Pyth pull oracle is live on devnet.</em></p><h3>Pythnet Appchain</h3><p>The Pythnet appchain is a Proof-of-Authority fork of Solana’s mainnet that acts as a computational base layer for processing and aggregating data provided by Pyth’s network of data publishers. The resulting price feeds on Pythnet are accessible to over <a href="https://pyth.network/blog/where-pyth-is-now-looking-towards-2024">50 blockchains</a> — excluding Solana, which has price feeds published directly to the blockchain. Because Pythnet is a fork of Solana, Pyth’s oracle framework on Solana and Pythnet are relatively similar with a few distinctions.</p><p>The push model on Solana described above (with accounts and the Oracle Program) is similar to Pythnet. However, Pythnet is not the destination chain and does not charge publishers for submitting prices. Hence, while data publishers push data to Pythnet to be aggregated and serialized into accounts via the Oracle Program, this data is then broadcast to other blockchains via <a href="https://wormhole.com/">Wormhole’s</a> cross-chain messaging protocol. Consumers then incur the costs on destination chains while initiating the data transfers with normal DeFi transactions that rely on oracle data — hence, pulling the data updates.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/3c020b05699f58e3b97717294f52e4b099f6020b-3200x1800.png?w=800" /><p><strong>Cross-Chain Messaging</strong></p><p>After data is published and aggregated on Pythnet, it is not immediately routed through Wormhole. Instead, Pyth routes its data through a message buffer and hashes it into a Merkle tree. Doing so ensures users can choose which updates are included in single transactions. It also keeps costs low for users and allows data updates to include arbitrary calculations. After every aggregation update, the aggregation program adds a message to the message buffer. For every slot, Pythnet validators read the messages and create a Merkle tree, sending a message containing the Merkle root of all the prices to the Wormhole contract on Pythnet.</p><p><a href="https://docs.wormhole.com/wormhole/explore-wormhole/guardian">Wormhole Guardians</a> (Wormhole nodes) then read the Merkle root message, create a Verifiable Action Approval (<a href="https://docs.wormhole.com/wormhole/explore-wormhole/vaa">VAA</a>), and broadcast price updates to the relevant blockchains. VAAs ensure that data is transferred reliably and securely. The VAAs include signatures from the Wormhole Guardians. These signatures confirm that the Guardians have witnessed and validated the information contained in the message, in this case, the Merkle root of the prices. The signed VAA is a verifiable and secure way to confirm that data transferred from Pythnet to the destination blockchain is accurate and has been authenticated by a trusted party (the Wormhole Guardians).</p><h3>Hermes</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/hermes">Hermes</a> is a web API that abstracts the update initiation process for developers. Without a service like Hermes, developers must manually compile an updated payload with the desired price feeds and use the Wormhole-verified Merkle root to get the corresponding data and Merkle proofs from Pythnet. Hermes introduces the ability for developers to simply query the web service to access oracle prices. Hermes enables data consumers to retrieve the latest prices pulling from REST or Websocket APIs.</p><ul><li><strong>REST (a subset of HTTP) API features</strong><ul><li>Best-suited for applications that require ad-hoc access to the latest data, need data at irregular intervals, or request data under certain conditions.</li><li>Simple to implement and use.</li><li>Streamlined client-server interaction, given each request is independent.</li><li>Scenarios: portfolio tracking, loan origination or repayment, etc.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Websocket API features</strong><ul><li>Best-suited for applications requiring real-time, continuous data streaming.</li><li>Low maintenance: After the initial setup, data can be sent back and forth without the overhead of repeated HTTP headers, making it efficient for frequent data transmissions.</li><li>Given the persistent connection between the client and server, real-time updates enable instantaneous data updates.</li><li>Scenarios: arbitrage trading, yield-optimization tools, DEX trading, etc.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Hermes is permissionless, enabling any third party to build a simplified access point to the Pyth Network. Because it is operationally difficult to run, the Pyth Data Association maintains a public version. However, other companies, like <a href="https://www.triton.one/pythnet/">Triton</a>, <a href="https://p2p.org/">P2P</a>, <a href="https://www.liquify.io/">Liquify</a>, and <a href="https://extrnode.com/solana">EXTR</a> also offer their own hosted versions of Hermes. A growing list of node providers offering Hermes can be found <a href="https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/api-instances-and-providers/hermes#node-providers">here</a>.</p><h2>Tokenomics</h2><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/2a97d6843c16ce81a690e39add0121f00f44044c-3200x1800.png?w=800" /><p>Pyth’s ecosystem token PYTH has a maximum supply of 10 billion PYTH. After its first unlock in May 2024, its distribution will reflect the following breakdown:</p><ul><li><strong>Community &amp; Launch (6%)</strong>: For initial launch and related activities and initiatives.</li><li><strong>Publisher Rewards (22%)</strong>: For Pyth’s network of data publishers. Used for rewards, grant programs, and as an incentive to encourage publishers to support new assets that may initially lack liquidity.</li><li><strong>Ecosystem Growth (52%)</strong>: For contributors to the Pyth Network, including but not limited to developers, researchers, educators, and early publishers. The goal is to encourage initiatives and reward contributions that go beyond the founding team and core contributors.</li><li><strong>Protocol Development (10%)</strong>: For core contributors building tooling, products, and infrastructure (i.e., <a href="https://dourolabs.xyz/">Douro Labs</a>).</li><li><strong>Private Sales (10%)</strong>: For two funding rounds. Pyth has not disclosed the price per PYTH sold nor its valuation for either of the rounds. In <a href="https://pyth.network/blog/expanding-the-pyth-community-strategic-capital-and-new-builders">December 2023</a>, Pyth published an update about an earlier strategic round that included notable investors, such as Castle Island Ventures, Wintermute Ventures, Borderless Capital, CMT Digital, Bodhi Ventures, Distributed Global, Multicoin Capital, and Delphi Digital.</li></ul><h3>Governance</h3><p>The <a href="https://messari.io/project/pyth-network">PYTH</a> token is an <a href="https://spl.solana.com/token">SPL</a> token on Solana (equivalent to an <a href="https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20">ERC-20</a> on Ethereum). The core utility of PYTH is <a href="https://app.realms.today/dao/PYTH">governance</a>. PYTH holders can guide protocol development by staking the asset and voting on Pyth Improvement Proposals (PIPs). As of writing, the only proposals voted on or being voted on include the Pythian Council elections and the ratification of the <a href="https://github.com/pyth-network/governance/blob/309c716599617971c6abb18f2097412d977b954f/docs/constitution/pyth-dao-constitution.md">Pyth DAO Constitution</a>. Typical subject matters that governance encompasses and can modify include:</p><ul><li>Onchain software updates</li><li>Reward structures for data providers</li><li>Creating rules for permissioning publishers</li><li>Size, denomination, and existence of oracle update fees</li><li>Adding new price feeds and determining who supports them</li></ul><p>Pyth DAO consists of the Pythian Council and the Price Feed Council. Both councils hold elections every six months to rotate members of the councils. Additionally, members who participate less than one-third of the time are excluded from reelection. This system ensures active members play a part in the process and that members stay aligned with Pyth’s goals. Both councils are responsible for the voting and implementation of certain Operational PIPs.</p><ul><li><strong>Pythian Council</strong><ul><li>Eight members and the Operations Wallet holder are signers of the Pythian 7-of-9 multi-sig wallet.</li><li>Four members are replaced every election.</li><li>Can be delegated the power to vote on Operational PIPs that involve updates to the oracle program, verification mechanism, adjusting oracle update fees and denominations, and the management of PGAS (the gas token on Pythnet that is allocated/delegated to validators).</li></ul></li><li><strong>Price Feed Council</strong><ul><li>Seven members and the Operations Wallet holder are signers of the Price Feed 5-of-8 multi-sig wallet.</li><li>Three members are replaced every election.</li><li>Can be delegated the power to vote on Operational PIPs that involve managing the set of offered price feeds, the selection of publishers, and price feed requirements (i.e., minimum and maximum publishers per feed).</li></ul></li></ul><p>After discussions on Pyth’s forum on <a href="https://discord.gg/nE79EaQA">Discord</a>, PYTH holders can vote on proposals when they reach the “Voting Phase” via the governance portal on <a href="https://app.realms.today/dao/PYTH">Realms</a>, which currently <a href="https://app.realms.today/dao/PYTH/params">requires</a> proposers to hold 25 million PYTH to create a proposal.</p><p>Pyth DAO has two types of PIPs: Constitutional and Operational. Constitutional PIPs involve protocol updates, determining structure, and guiding the administration of the Pyth DAO. They require greater than 67% support for implementation. Operational PIPs involve elections and the management of the treasury, Pythian Council, and Price Feed Council. Voting on these PIPs can be delegated to Council members and require greater than 50% support for implementation.</p><h2>Pyth Usage</h2><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/e7f672835cb71eab6d6b7efa34c269c345d57967-3200x1800.png?w=800" /><p>Pyth is one of the most used protocols on Solana. Its oracle transactions accounted for an average of 20% of all transactions on Solana during February 2024. In this same time period, Pyth data providers paid $225,000 in fees on Solana. Pyth oracles secure 95% of the value on the blockchain. Pyth also secures over 90% of the value on 9 other blockchains and over 50% on 16 others, as of <a href="https://pyth.network/blog/where-pyth-is-now-looking-towards-2024">January 2024</a>.</p><h3>Notable Users</h3><p>Pyth has become one of the most widely used oracle protocols across an array of blockchains, thanks to its ability to scale feeds on Pythnet. Instead of adding new feeds to destination chains, it simply adds new feeds to Pythnet, which can be used by Pyth’s oracle contract on each destination chain it supports. Hence, Pyth can simply build an oracle contract for whatever chain it plans to expand to. With its growing support for many blockchains, various projects have adopted Pyth’s oracle network. A couple of notable projects are listed below.</p><p><strong>Synthetix</strong></p><p><a href="https://messari.io/report/synthetix-q4-2023-brief">Synthetix</a> is a decentralized liquidity provisioning protocol that enables the creation of synthetic assets, known as Synths, which track the value of crypto and real-world assets like currencies, commodities, and stocks. Synthetix allows users to gain exposure to various assets without actually holding them, thereby broadening investment opportunities and enhancing liquidity in the crypto market. A crucial component of Synthetix's functionality is its <a href="https://docs.synthetix.io/synthetix-protocol/the-synthetix-protocol/oracles">integration</a> with Pyth Network oracles. These oracles provide high-fidelity, real-time price feeds that are essential for maintaining the accuracy of the Synths' values.</p><p><strong>Helium</strong></p><p><a href="https://messari.io/report/helium-laying-the-foundation-for-a-telecom-network-deployment-platform">Helium</a> is a decentralized wireless Internet of Things (IoT) network. It incorporates token-economic incentives encouraging network participants to deploy wireless devices that provide mobile network coverage. Helium <a href="https://docs.helium.com/oracles/price-oracles">utilizes</a> Pyth Network oracles to provide precise onchain market prices for Helium's native token, HNT. These values are essential for a range of network activities, including the conversion of burned HNT into Data Credits (DC) and accurately measuring treasury allocations. Though Helium is not DeFi, using Pyth oracles in Helium’s decentralized connectivity platform highlights the importance of precise data in managing the economics of even <a href="https://messari.io/report/state-of-depin-2023">DePIN</a> protocols.</p><p><strong>Eclipse</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.eclipse.xyz/">Eclipse</a> recently <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/281566/eclipse-labs-raises-50-million-in-series-a-funding-ahead-of-expected-q2-mainnet">raised $50 million</a> in a Series A round to launch the first Layer-2 blockchain that will use the SVM (Solana Virtual Machine) for execution and Celestia for data availability, all while deriving security from Ethereum as a settlement layer. The launch of Eclipse should attract liquidity from Ethereum users and route them to Solana-based decentralized applications across the Layer-2. As Solana’s leading oracle, Pyth will support many of the applications expanding to and launching on Eclipse.</p><h2>Competitive Analysis</h2><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/817677a4dcd2f4a2efeb65915724552cedb7ada8-3200x1800.png?w=800" /><p>The oracle landscape is a competitive sector that has been dominated by Chainlink. Though <a href="https://messari.io/report/web3-oracles-on-chronicle-protocol">Chronicle Protocol</a> created the first onchain oracle in 2017 for MakerDAO, it did not launch a public oracle network until late 2023. It currently only offers feeds on two blockchains, though it plans to expand. Chainlink captured market share in the developing years of DeFi, launching a variety of oracle-based products that serve a broad spectrum of markets. As of writing, only three protocols <a href="https://defillama.com/oracles">secure more value</a> than Pyth Network: Chainlink, Chronicle, and WINkLink — these top four protocols account for 90–95% of the TVS among oracles. That said, Pyth secures value on the largest number of blockchains. Chainlink is Pyth’s largest competitor in both the diversity of blockchains covered and value secured.</p><h3>Chainlink</h3><p>Critics have referred to Chainlink as a “<a href="https://blockworks.co/news/chronicle-protocol-oracle-black-box-problem">black box</a>” given the opaqueness of where oracle nodes source their data. Sources are not identified onchain nor on the websites of Chainlink oracle nodes. In contrast, each data point on Pyth Network can be traced back to the public keys of individual publishers by copying the transaction hash from Pyth’s <a href="https://pyth.network/price-feeds">Price Feed web page</a> to any Solana <a href="https://explorer.solana.com/">block explorer</a>. While data on Chainlink can also be traced back to Chainlink oracle nodes, Pyth data providers are first-party sources. Unlike Chainlink’s data, Pyth’s published data was sourced internally from their operations as an exchange, trading firm, market maker, etc. However, provider public keys are not publicly linked with their identity, which adds a layer of trust in how Pyth (which permissioned publishers originally) manages its publisher network.</p><p>While Pyth is singularly focused on traditional finance and crypto price feeds, Chainlink has several offerings. These include an interoperability protocol (<a href="https://chain.link/cross-chain">CCIP</a>), <a href="https://chain.link/proof-of-reserve">Proof of Reserve</a> feeds, and developer tooling (<a href="https://chain.link/vrf">VRFs</a>, <a href="https://chain.link/functions">API functions</a>, and <a href="https://chain.link/automation">automation services</a>), in addition to its <a href="https://chain.link/data-feeds">market data</a> feeds. Hence, Pyth’s primary product challenges Chainlink’s leading market data feed product — though Pyth also offers a random number generator through <a href="https://pyth.network/blog/secure-random-numbers-for-blockchains">Pyth Entropy</a>. The following is a comparison of the aspects of Pyth’s and Chainlink’s market data feeds:</p><p><strong>Data source</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Pyth</strong><ul><li>Pyth aggregates data directly from primary sources and updates price feeds on the Pythnet appchain and Solana every 400 ms.</li><li>Outside of Solana, other chains must initiate a price update for it to be published to the respective chain, implying that the staleness of data is between 400 ms and the next on-demand update.</li><li>There’s a potential conflict of interest for data publishers (that also trade) to publish honest data points that may be disadvantageous to particular trades. Assuming most publishers are honest, seek to maintain a high reputation, and do not coordinate updates, Pyth’s aggregation algorithm should mitigate this risk by applying a low weight to outlier data points.</li><li>Sourcing data directly from primary sources enables the quick addition of price feeds for newly created pairs.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Chainlink</strong><ul><li>Chainlink aggregates data from secondary sources (data aggregators) and publishes prices feed updates onchain where the frequency depends on the blockchain.</li><li>Staleness of a data point is dependent on secondary source updates and oracle network aggregation.</li><li>Though a primary source may support a particular trading pair, price feed availability depends on secondary aggregators also implementing coverage of that data point. This could add friction in adding new feeds, though this is not an issue with significant trading pairs.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Pull v. Push Model</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Pyth</strong><ul><li>Pyth on Solana uses a push model, publishing updates every 400 ms.</li><li>Pyth on Pythnet uses a pull model, where users initiate an update on the destination chain, published updates on Pythnet are routed through Wormhole, and updates are published to the requesting chain. The users incur costs in this model.</li><li>Because all market price feeds (outside Solana) are on Pythnet, Pyth offers increased scalability that reduces the costs and time to integrate feeds directly on supported/new chains. However, Pyth’s scalability introduces latency and an added layer of trust/reliance on Wormhole.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Chainlink</strong><ul><li>Chainlink’s primary market feeds use a push model, publishing updates often at the block times of destination chains. This can be costly to the oracle nodes and can cause update transactions to fail in high-volatility environments (though rare).</li><li>Adding price feeds to new and existing chains is more costly, as new price feeds must be implemented for each supported network.</li><li>Not reliant on an additional relayer, and does not add trust between Chainlink’s oracle network and destination blockchains.</li><li>Chainlink also offers a pull model in its <a href="https://data.chain.link/streams">Data Streams</a> product.</li><li>Similar data process to push model, except data is delivered to Chainlink’s offchain Data Engine, which delivers price updates when data is requested onchain.</li><li>Currently, Data Streams are only on Arbitrum and maintain eight price feeds.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Usage</strong></p><ul><li>Pyth <a href="https://defillama.com/oracles">secures</a> $5.5 billion on 162 protocols across <a href="https://pyth.network/blog/pyth-price-feeds-launch-on-hedera">50+ blockchains</a>.</li><li>Chainlink <a href="https://defillama.com/oracles">secures</a> $38.7 billion on 371 protocols across <a href="https://defillama.com/oracles">19 blockchains</a>.</li></ul><p>Both systems offer advantages and disadvantages in market data feeds. Pyth’s model is better equipped to scale the number of price feeds and maintain high update frequency. However, Pyth’s ability to maintain high-fidelity data depends on the assumption that the costs of reputation and collusion outweigh any profitable, malicious actions that could benefit publishers. And its network stability relies on Wormhole's uptime. Conversely, Chainlink’s model requires less trust in original data sources and between the oracle network and supported blockchains, given it pulls from secondary aggregation sources and publishes directly to destination chains. However, scaling data feeds and reaching a wider breadth of blockchains is more costly. Regardless, as crypto continues to grow, new protocols will have many options and tradeoffs/risks to consider in implementing different oracle price feeds.</p><h2>Closing Summary</h2><p>Pyth Network is a novel protocol that has changed the oracle landscape. It fosters a network of first-party data publishers and implements a pull-based oracle that offloads fees to oracle users. With this design, Pyth cuts costs for the oracle network, increases price update frequency, and secures direct market data based directly on primary data sources. Since launching, Pyth has grown to serve the largest number of blockchains and accounts for the fourth-largest amount of total value secured ($5.5 billion as of March 2024). As it grows its publisher network, Pyth is well-positioned to achieve its mission of making all of the world’s financial market data available to Web3.</p><p>——</p></div>

Polkadot was built using the <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk">Polkadot SDK</a>, a blockchain development framework. Furthermore, Polkadot’s base layer is known as the <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-architecture#relay-chain">Relay Chain</a>, which employs a <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-consensus#nominated-proof-of-stake">Nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPoS)</a> consensus mechanism, and its state machine is compiled to <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-wasm">WebAssembly (Wasm)</a>.</p><p><br />Polkadot's governance transitioned to the <a href="https://polkadot.network/features/opengov/">OpenGov</a> model on June 15, 2023, marking a significant evolution from its original <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-governance#:~:text=Polkadot%20uses%20a%20sophisticated%20governance,can%20always%20command%20the%20network.">Gov V1</a> framework. This new model has enhanced the platform's governance by introducing mechanisms that have led to a higher frequency of referenda, an increase in Treasury activities, and a greater level of decentralization. This report will delve into the details of Polkadot’s governance, providing a comprehensive comparison between the original Gov V1 and the OpenGov model. It will also analyze the impact of these governance changes on the network.</p><p></p><h2>Polkadot Governance V1</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>The initial governance framework of Polkadot, <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-governance#:~:text=Polkadot%20uses%20a%20sophisticated%20governance,can%20always%20command%20the%20network.">Governance V1</a>, centered around three core bodies: the Council, the Technical Committee, and the Referendum Chamber. These groups collectively supported the network's finances, technology, and other miscellaneous developments. This structure facilitated a balanced approach to decision-making and operations, engaging various stakeholders in the governance process.</p><h3>Stakeholders</h3><p>The roles of Gov V1 stakeholders were as follows:</p><ul><li><a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-governance#council"><strong>Council</strong></a>: Composed of 13 members, the Council's responsibilities included managing proposals, canceling referenda, and electing the Technical Committee. </li><li><a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-governance#technical-committee"><strong>Technical Committee</strong></a>: Formed by key Polkadot developers and selected by the Council, the Technical Committee was tasked with blocking harmful proposals and expediting necessary fixes and updates. </li><li><a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-governance#technical-committee"><strong>Referendum Chamber</strong></a>: This chamber included all DOT token-holders engaged in the governance process by staking, endorsing, or delegating their tokens to gain voting rights. </li></ul><p></p><p>Funding for the Polkadot ecosystem was managed through the <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-treasury">Treasury</a> in Gov V1. The Treasury accumulated resources from block rewards and transaction fees. Spending proposals required Council approval and a waiting period of 28 days. </p><h3>Process</h3><p></p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/2d087b0bc2d520daae1d2a89881670f526bb08a7-6400x3572.png?w=800" /><p>The Polkadot Gov V1 governance process was structured to engage token holders actively in the network's evolution. The process is outlined as follows:<br /></p><ol><li><strong>Proposal Submission and Endorsement</strong>: Any party could initiate proposals. These were then queued and required endorsements to progress. The most supported proposal was moved forward for voting.</li><li><strong>Referendum and Voting</strong>: The voting cycle alternated between public proposals and those put forward by the Council, incorporating emergency fast-tracks and token-boosted delegated voting.</li><li><strong>Council and Treasury Involvement</strong>: The Council played a key role in managing Treasury funds, proposing, and evaluating proposals.</li><li><strong>Adaptive Quorum Biasing</strong>: Voting thresholds were adjusted dynamically based on turnout and the source of proposals.</li><li><strong>Proposal Enactment</strong>: Passed referenda, subject to a waiting period, alternated between public and council proposals.</li></ol><p></p><h2>Polkadot OpenGov</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>The Polkadot ecosystem <a href="https://polkadot.network/newsroom/press-releases/polkadot-hands-decision-making-powers-to-its-community-with-opengov-launch">rolled out</a> <a href="https://polkadot.network/features/opengov/">OpenGov</a> on June 15, 2023. This model places the community at the center of decision-making processes and eliminates any control from Parity Technologies and Web3 Foundation.</p><p><a href="https://messari.io/report/state-of-polkadot-q1-2023?referrer=asset:polkadot">Referenda</a> in the OpenGov system undergo a structured life cycle for enactment, including the Lead-in Period for proposal submission, the Decision Period for voting and approval, and the Enactment Period for execution. OpenGov allows multiple referenda to run concurrently, allowing for the faster passage of motions.</p><p>In the OpenGov framework, the traditional roles of the Council and Technical Committee have evolved into the <a href="https://messari.io/report/state-of-polkadot-q1-2023?referrer=asset:polkadot">Fellowship</a>, which provides deep technical expertise without special voting powers. Functioning as a developer DAO, it champions decentralization through advocating community-based voting along with rigorous checks and balances. Membership to the Fellowship is open to all who qualify, marking a departure from the exclusive council system. This model also commits to <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-polkadot-technical-fellowship">paying developers</a> for their contributions to Polkadot. Furthermore, it introduces a novel delegation mechanism, empowering users to allocate their voting power by conviction and token commitment.</p><p></p><h3>Stakeholders</h3><p>The OpenGov stakeholders’ roles are as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>DOT Tokenholders</strong>: DOT tokenholders are at the heart of the OpenGov system and carry the primary responsibility for governance decisions. This includes voting on proposals, delegating voting rights, and actively participating in shaping the network's future. The direct democracy model empowers every tokenholder to have a say in the governance process, democratizing the decision-making and making the system more reflective of the community's collective will.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/polkadot-fellows"><strong>Polkadot Technical Fellowship</strong></a>: As the new technical advisory body, the Fellowship plays a crucial role in guiding the technical direction of the Polkadot network. They are responsible for reviewing technical proposals and ensuring that changes and updates to the network are sound, secure, and aligned with Polkadot's long-term vision.</li></ul><p>This evolution in governance roles under OpenGov illustrates a strategic move towards a more participatory and technically robust decision-making process, aligning closely with the ethos of decentralized and democratic blockchain governance.</p><h3>Process</h3><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/c8f086f84fc678a83e7b41db2760cd9967cdcccb-6432x3604.png?w=800" /><p>OpenGov introduces a nuanced and dynamic system for proposal submission, evaluation, and enactment:</p><p><strong>1. Proposal Submission and Evaluation</strong>:</p><ul><li>Public Initiation: In OpenGov, all proposals originate from the public, emphasizing community-driven governance.</li><li>Lead-in Period: After submission, proposals enter a lead-in period, a preparatory phase that ensures proposals are thoroughly considered before moving forward.</li><li>Assignment to Tracks: Proposals are categorized into one of fifteen Tracks based on their nature and requirements, each with a distinct Origin determining the referendum's duration and voting capacity.<strong>Tracks and Origins</strong>:</li><li>Diverse Tracks for Varied Proposals: Tracks like Small Tipper or Big Spender categorize Treasury proposals by funding amount, ensuring appropriate handling.</li><li>Expedited Processing: The Polkadot Technical Fellowship can fast-track proposals via a Whitelist Caller origin, streamlining the review and voting processes.</li></ul><p><strong>2. Voting and Approval Process</strong>:</p><ul><li>Simultaneous Voting Across Tracks: OpenGov permits concurrent voting on proposals across different tracks, adhering to capacity limits to ensure manageable decision-making.</li><li>Multi-Role Delegations: Voters can delegate their voting power to experts in specific tracks, optimizing governance participation without requiring constant engagement from all tokenholders.</li></ul><p><strong>3. Mechanisms for Control and Correction</strong>:</p><ul><li>Cancellation and Blacklisting: OpenGov allows the community to cancel ongoing referenda or blacklist proposals, preventing them from re-entering the queue. This feature is essential for managing malicious or spam proposals.</li></ul><p><strong>4. Detailed Governance Stages</strong>:</p><ul><li>Creation and Lead-in: Proposals must satisfy origin-specific criteria, including a deposit to manage spam and capacity.</li><li>Decision Period: Proposals advance to voting, where they must meet predefined approval and support criteria to pass.</li><li>Enactment Period: Successful proposals undergo an enactment period before the changes are implemented, allowing the network to prepare for the transition.</li></ul><p><strong>5. Additional Governance Elements</strong>:</p><ul><li>Origin and Track Dynamics: Each proposal's path is determined by its Origin and Track, with specific parameters for decision-making and enactment tailored to its impact.</li><li>Multiplier Feature: Tokenholders can amplify their voting power through token locking, with the conviction multiplier increasing based on the lock period.</li><li>Approval and Support Mechanisms: Proposals require meeting approval and support thresholds within a confirmation period to progress, ensuring broad consensus for enactment.</li></ul><p><strong>6. Strategic Voting and Proposal Management</strong>:</p><ul><li>Approval and Support Thresholds: A sophisticated system evaluates proposal viability through approval and support metrics, adjusting to ensure proposals have substantial backing.</li><li>Dynamic Confirmation Period: The confirmation period's flexibility allows for re-evaluating proposals based on shifting voter sentiment, maintaining governance integrity</li></ul><p>Polkadot's OpenGov system introduces a governance model that balances community input, expert evaluation, and strategic decision-making. Through its stages, multi-tiered voting system, and mechanisms for correction and control, OpenGov empowers the Polkadot community to actively shape the network's evolution in a structured and effective manner.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/20bc2470696e15dba1934b984fb754e0322b7cff-6400x3572.png?w=800" /><h2>Data</h2><p>This data is sourced from the Parity Data Team’s <a href="https://twitter.com/dotlake_xyz">DotLake</a> platform, a data lake containing offchain and onchain data on the Polkadot ecosystem.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/9b33e69b0fdf40253a9d884b8be42214ac7d6bc0-6400x3600.png?w=800" /><p>Following the transition to OpenGov, a significant increase in platform engagement has been observed. The average number of votes has risen by 1,981% compared to Gov V1. This trend extends to referenda, which have seen a 1,008% increase in participation after the transition. Notably, 40% of referenda under OpenGov were not approved, in contrast to a 9% rejection rate under Gov V1. This indicates a shift towards a wider range of voting behaviors and outcomes, suggesting that OpenGov fosters a more diverse and dynamic governance environment than its predecessor.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/36717088dc409dda25283bbd8474d652116bcec5-6400x3600.png?w=800" /><p>Since the introduction of OpenGov, the number of Treasury proposal submissions has significantly exceeded those made through Gov V1. Gov V1 recorded 83 proposals before OpenGov’s implementation, while OpenGov received 401 proposals (+405%). This transition resulted in an average monthly increase of 126% in proposals submitted to OpenGov, which now represents 80% of all treasury proposals. OpenGov proposals peaked in November 2023 with 92.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/5527d7e9a504253e5ddfa39f262c922b63cce37d-6400x3600.png?w=800" /><p>Between June 2023 and January 2024, the counts of direct and delegated voters in the Polkadot governance system were closely matched, with 66,602 direct voters and 65,508 delegated voters recorded. Initially, direct voting was the more popular method following the launch of OpenGov, but over time, the trend shifted towards an increasing preference for delegated voting. December 2023 experienced the highest voter turnout in the latter half of the year, which could be attributed to year-end voting activities. This trend towards delegated voting indicates a clear preference that is expected to maintain or increase governance participation over time.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/b1a5451ed20ed6160f2fc62e6af7e42039b6d51b-6400x3600.png?w=800" /><p>Outflows from the Polkadot Treasury have seen a steady increase. The primary outflows are from <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-polkadot-opengov-treasury#bounties">bounties</a> and proposals. Both bounties and proposals saw increases in the second half of 2023, with bounties increasing 18% and proposals increasing 116%.<br /></p><h2>Closing Summary</h2><p>Polkadot's governance underwent a significant evolution with the transition to OpenGov in June 2023. The shift aimed to enhance community involvement through new mechanisms like replacing the Council and Technical Committee with the Fellowship and introducing a more dynamic proposal system. Thus far, OpenGov has accomplished its mission with referenda and votes each up over 1,000% through six months, treasury proposals up over 405%, and both direct and delegated voters increasing.</p><p>Overall, this new governance model has boosted platform engagement and governance participation. These changes underscore Polkadot's commitment to fostering a participatory and responsive ecosystem.</p></div>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。在一场众议院农业委员会听证会上，CFTC主席Behnam敦促国会关闭加密商品现货市场的监管漏洞，并重申CFTC的立场，即ETH是一种商品。在参议院，美联储主席杰罗姆·鲍威尔告诉银行业委员会成员，美联储永远不会直接向个人发行CBDC，只会通过银行进行，而且只会在明确得到国会授权的情况下才会这样做。此外，能源信息管理局同意停止对商业加密矿工进行的“紧急”数据收集，销毁已经收集的数据。它现在将遵循传统的通知和评论期流程。 <div>
<p>At a House Ag hearing, CFTC Chair Behnam urged Congress to close the regulatory gap in the crypto commodity spot market and reaffirmed the CFTC's position that ETH is a commodity. In the Senate, Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Senate Banking Committee members that the Fed would never issue a CBDC directly to individuals, only through banks, and would only do so with clear Congressional authorization. Also, the Energy Information Administration agreed to stop its "emergency" data collection from commercial crypto miners, destroy the data it had already collected. It will now follow the traditional notice and comment period process.</p>

MATIC’s circulating market cap increased 80% QoQ from $4.9 billion to $8.8 billion, outpacing the overall crypto market’s growth of 54%. This Q4 growth brought MATIC’s YoY change to 29%. MATIC’s market cap ranks in the top 15 among all crypto projects.</p><h3><strong>Revenue</strong></h3><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/eb768e6c48b89347dea717144f48224ef2927dd5-1280x720.png?w=800" /><p>In Q4 2023, Polygon PoS's revenue from network transaction fees surged 67% QoQ, increasing from $5.1 million to $8.4 million. On November 16, daily revenue hit a yearly peak of nearly $1 million, driven by activity surrounding <a href="https://messari.io/intel/event/cdb09666-8eea-48f0-89af-7ab4aba89ecb">Inscription NFTs</a>. This surge <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/polygon-gas-fees-spike-thousand-percent-ordinals-token-craze">temporarily pushed gas fees up by 1,000%</a>. However, these spikes quickly reverted to standard levels. Even discounting this temporary surge, Polygon's revenue for the quarter still showed an increase. For 2023, the total revenue for Polygon PoS was $37 million.</p><h3><strong>Supply</strong></h3><p>As part of the <a href="https://polygon.technology/roadmap">Polygon 2.0 upgrade</a>, MATIC is being phased out in favor of <a href="https://polygon.technology/blog/polygon-2-0-tokenomics">POL</a>. POL will enable holders to contribute to network security on various protocols in the Polygon ecosystem via a native re-staking protocol, earning rewards for diverse services. These services range from basic transaction validations to more advanced tasks like generating ZK-validity proofs. Each protocol in the Polygon ecosystem can offer customized roles and rewards for validators. Validators can choose to validate multiple chains at once to compound their rewards in a similar manner to EigenLayer’s <a href="https://www.eigenlayer.xyz/">restaking</a> offering on Ethereum.</p><p>POL adopts an inflationary model with a yearly emission rate <a href="https://forum.polygon.technology/t/pip-26-transition-from-matic-to-pol-validator-rewards/13046">subject to community governance</a> to incentivize validator participation and fund a <a href="https://polygon.technology/papers/pol-whitepaper">community-governed treasury</a>.</p><p>During Q3, the Polygon Labs team unveiled three Polygon Improvement Proposals for community consideration: <a href="https://messari.io/intel/event/d0e74848-22bf-4db8-a23b-f9b08a3d5b26">PIP-17</a>, <a href="https://messari.io/intel/event/64bb8a5b-464a-4d26-82ba-bad25378e888">PIP-18</a>, and <a href="https://messari.io/intel/event/a8026c81-1cb6-4643-ad6a-e8b85f482c60">PIP-19</a>. PIP-17 details the POL token and its relevant contracts. PIP-18 introduces the inaugural phase of the Polygon 2.0 upgrade. PIP-19 suggests transitioning the primary gas token on Polygon PoS from MATIC to POL, emphasizing an upgrade to the PoS Plasma Bridge Contract to facilitate the token transition. On October 25, the <a href="https://x.com/0xPolygonLabs/status/1717134336104038580?s=20">POL contract was deployed on mainnet</a>.</p><h2><strong>Usage</strong></h2><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/36afaacf1056ff5efc214f3c79d4448fc7a58dda-1280x720.png?w=800" /><p>Throughout 2023, Polygon PoS experienced a consistent growth in active addresses, reaching a peak of 372,000 daily active addresses in Q4. This increase was led by the DeFi and gaming sectors.

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。在Q4，The Sandbox的市值增长了89％，达到12亿美元。非LAND活动增长显著，包括非LAND活跃买家（73％）、非LAND铸造（233％）、非LAND二手销量（173％）和非LAND二手销售额（78％）。The Sandbox与多个品牌合作，如Drecom、Gucci、Lacoste、Warner Music Group、Sandsoft和Mediacorp。此外，Q4还举办了多场活动，其中Dr. Bomkus' Trials活动派发了180万SAND作为奖励。总体而言，The Sandbox在Q4取得了强劲的表现，展望着继续在Web3游戏领域吸引更多用户的目标。 <div>
<div><h2>Key Insights</h2><ul><li><strong>The circulating market cap of SAND increased by 89% QoQ from $649.9 million to $1.2 billion. </strong>SAND outperformed the total market cap of all cryptocurrencies in Q4.</li><li><strong>Non-LAND activity saw impressive QoQ growth in Q4,</strong> including daily average active non-LAND buyers (73%), non-LAND mints (233%), daily average non-LAND secondary sales (173%), and daily average non-LAND secondary volume (78%).</li><li><strong>The Sandbox partnered with brands like Drecom, Gucci, Lacoste, Warner Music Group, Sandsoft and Mediacorp.</strong> Several other brands and companies also focused on building virtual experiences in the Web3 industry.</li><li><strong>1.8 million SAND was given as rewards to players during the Dr. Bomkus’ Trials event. </strong>Other popular Q4 events included the FallO’ween event, the “Season’s Greetings” event, the Lotte World experience, and more.</li></ul><h2>Primer</h2><p>The Sandbox (<a href="https://messari.io/project/the-sandbox">SAND</a>) is a gaming metaverse where players and creators can make 3D assets and experiences (e.g. games) that can be monetized via NFTs. The tokenized and gaming features leveraged by The Sandbox are listed below.</p><ul><li>SAND — an ERC-20 token and digital in-game currency used for purchases, monetization, and asset creation</li><li>LAND — digital ownable land within The Sandbox virtual world</li><li>ESTATE — a combination of LANDs to create a larger plot</li><li>ASSET — assets created using the VoxEdit application that are converted to ERC-1155 tokens when uploaded to The Sandbox marketplace</li><li>AVATARS — ERC-721 tokens that are playable characters within The Sandbox virtual world</li><li>CATALYST — tokens burnt to define an ASSETs tier/scarcity</li><li>Game Maker — a <a href="https://gamemaker.sandbox.game/#/en/a">toolbox</a> that enables users to create 3D games and experiences in The Sandbox virtual world</li><li>VoxEdit — software used to create and animate equipment and other types of gaming assets</li><li>Game Client — enables players to play experiences created with the Game Maker</li></ul><p>The Sandbox provides Roblox-esque gameplay with digital ownership and more robust in-game economics due to the tradeable nature of the SAND token and the other assets within the Sandbox virtual world.</p><p>Sandbox offers a variety of in-game NFTs as well as user-generated NFTs. The VoxEdit NFT builder is used for creating 3D objects (ASSETs) such as characters, equipment, wearables, and art.</p><p>The Sandbox was initially launched as a <a href="https://www.pixowl.com/games/the-sandbox/">2D mobile game in 2012</a> by the software development company <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pixowl/">Pixowl</a>. Pixowl was founded in 2011 by Arthur Madrid and Sebastien Borget. The mobile game iteration of Sandbox accumulated more than <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/03/19/the-sandbox-raises-2-million-more-to-build-out-blockchain-based-game-world/">40 million downloads</a> by April 2018. In May 2018, The Sandbox <a href="https://www.pixowl.com/gamesposts/animoca-brands-acquires-pixowl-world-building-developer-of-the-sandbox/">rebranded</a> as a 3D metaverse game and blockchain-focused development began. In August 2018, Pixowl and The Sandbox were <a href="https://www.pixowl.com/gamesposts/animoca-brands-acquires-pixowl-world-building-developer-of-the-sandbox/">acquired by Animoca Brands</a>, a gaming-focused software development company and VC Fund.</p><p><a href="https://www.sandbox.game/en/">Website</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/TheSandboxGame">X (Twitter)</a> / <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vAe4zvY">Discord</a></p><h2>Network Overview</h2><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/e7bea12c089753af07a5179e25e542492ae4560e-7296x4060.png?w=800" /><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/2c1d2efd0ee4cbc0e98afc20ffddc819b1c9c3f8-720x405.png?w=800" /><p>SAND staking is conducted on the Polygon network and involves two staking pools: one for LAND owners and one for everyone else. LAND owners can stake up to 2,000 SAND per LAND asset in this pool. In the other pool, any SAND holder can stake their SAND, though LAND owners receive a multiplier based on the number of LANDs they own.</p><p>Daily average SAND staked was down 8% QoQ, from 110.2 million to 101.7 million. By the end of Q4, 23.8 million SAND was staked in the LAND pool, and 74.8 million SAND was staked in the non-LAND owners pool. The amount of SAND staked by LAND owners decreased by 7% QoQ, but the amount of SAND staked in the non-LAND owners pool actually increased by 1% QoQ. Additionally, the percentage of circulating supply of SAND staked fell by 11% QoQ from 5.5% to 4.9%.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/0a2dcb0601f7dca8eb1f65d0fe77d345eac197b9-720x405.png?w=800" /><p>The decrease in SAND staked throughout 2023 also coincided with lower SAND staking rewards. In Q4 of last year, 5.6 million SAND was distributed as staking rewards. In Q4, this number fell by 82% to 1 million SAND. However, over the same time period, the daily average amount of SAND staked only fell by 9% from 112.2 million. This dynamic suggests that The Sandbox may have been overcompensating stakers earlier in the year.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/78c7ede648109c0af51cc6ffc68144195dd0f06a-720x405.png?w=800" /><p>Non-LAND minting activity bounced back in Q4, totaling 30,194 mints (up 233% QoQ) for the entire quarter. This also lead to a YoY increase of 246%. Popular non-LAND mints in Q4 included Avatars from the <a href="https://www.sandbox.game/avatar-collections/captain-laserhawk?utm_source=thesandboxtwitter&amp;utm_campaign=captainlaserhawk&amp;utm_medium=_5651876&amp;gsid=1eeb57c8344c64f69c2736f1f18fd449&amp;gsc=1">Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix</a>, <a href="https://www.sandbox.game/avatar-collections/extraordinary-attorney-woo/en/">Extraordinary Attorney Woo</a>, and <a href="https://www.sandbox.game/avatar-collections/big-poppa-collection/en/">THE NOTORIOUS B.I.G. Big Poppa</a> collections. As for LAND items, they experienced a downtrend in Q4. After an impressive 3,719 LAND mints in Q3, LAND mints fell by 59% QoQ to 1,536 in Q4.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/23d6939113317faa0b33d5404e8852c5be6406dc-720x405.png?w=800" /><p>Activity on The Sandbox is conducted through digital real estate called LAND NFTs. Content creators can host metaverse experiences on plots of LAND. As such, LAND is valued highly amongst all The Sandbox NFTs. While non-LAND NFTs are valued lower, they are still necessary for various types of activities in The Sandbox metaverse (e.g., CATALYSTS to create ASSETS and give them attributes).</p><p>With a difference in general monetary value, LAND is harder to acquire (at a 0.33 ETH floor on <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/sandbox/analytics">OpenSea</a> as of December 31), lowering the buyer pool. Non-LAND assets are priced lower (at a 0.0001 ETH floor on <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/the-sandbox-assets/activity?search[sortAscending]=true&amp;search[sortBy]=UNIT_PRICE&amp;search[toggles][0]=BUY_NOW">OpenSea</a> as of December 31), drawing a larger pool of buyers. These differences were accentuated by poor NFT market conditions in 2023, potentially contributing to the number of active LAND buyers falling (down 20% QoQ) and to active non-LAND buyers increasing (up 73% QoQ).</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/80d53cdb52d7402410f4922dd40b771d0da62ce8-720x405.png?w=800" /><p>The secondary sale volume measures the USD amounts for The Sandbox assets that were sold on secondary exchanges like OpenSea and LooksRare.</p><p>Daily average secondary volume for LAND increased by 11% QoQ, from $19,100 to $21,300. The daily average for secondary sales of LAND also increased by 19% QoQ, from 30 to 35. As such, the remaining active buyers demonstrated a willingness to spend larger amounts of money on LAND, even though the number of active LAND buyers decreased in Q4.</p><p>Alongside the number of active buyers for non-LAND items increasing in Q4, the daily average secondary volume for non-LAND items increased by 78% from $1,900 to $3,400. Furthermore, the daily average for sales also increased by 173% QoQ from 64 to 176.</p><h2>Financial Overview</h2><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/53243d5d4b01c99b3aafeeca027a0ba0b73d0310-7296x4060.png?w=800" /><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/d73dc92e6c11f01a803a5824475f4a690c9cdaa7-720x405.png?w=800" /><p>Q4 was a strong quarter for SAND’s price performance, as its circulating market cap increased by 89% QoQ from $649.9 million to $1.2 billion. This increase was largely attributable to the price increase of SAND, up 86% QoQ from $0.31 to $0.58. Additionally, SAND outperformed the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/global-charts">total market cap</a> of all cryptocurrencies, which gained 54% in Q4. Comparatively, SAND also outperformed gaming peer MANA (up 68% QoQ), but it slightly underperformed AXS (up 92% QoQ) and GALA (up 98% QoQ).</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/8ac00ffbcb8b85c6d0c4575977458bc05f5180b5-720x405.png?w=800" /><p>The total primary sale volume measures the USD amounts for which assets from The Sandbox were sold. The Sandbox company retains the earnings from primary sales. The Sandbox conducts five different types of primary sales: public non-LAND, public LAND, private LAND, private ESTATE, and private Auction.</p><p>In total, primary sales volume was down 47% QoQ, decreasing from $1.38 million to $739,000. In nominal terms, primary LAND sales volume fell the most, decreasing by $409,000 QoQ (down 55% QoQ). In percentage terms, Auction volume fell the most, decreasing by 69% QoQ (down $24,000 QoQ).</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/bf26cbdf9176bcba5a66c47a1d74100d7b3ffc0e-720x405.png?w=800" /><p>The Sandbox’s breakdown of primary sales volume was consistently changing throughout 2023. In Q1, the biggest driver of primary sales volume was private LAND sales. By Q4, however, public LAND sales had become the largest driver, representing 44% of all primary sales volume. Categories that saw an increase in share of primary sales volume in Q4 included non-LAND sales (up 43% QoQ to 29%) and private LAND sales (up 19% QoQ to 11%).

This drop was primarily due to the decrease in primary sales volume, as that is the largest driver of revenue for The Sandbox. Despite the fall in revenue, royalty revenue picked up in Q4. Royalty revenue from LAND sales increased from $51,000 to $95,000, an 87% QoQ increase. Non-LAND royalty revenue was down slightly, down 12% QoQ from $6,000 to $5,000.</p><h2>Qualitative Analysis</h2><p>Q4’23 marked another busy quarter for The Sandbox, highlighted by various events, partnerships, integrations, and updates.
