However, in the recent bear market, new Layer-1 networks emerged with technological innovations that hoped to address these limitations. <a href="https://www.sei.io/">Sei</a> was no exception, as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/seilabs/about/">Sei Labs</a> created a Layer-1 network with the goal of becoming the fastest network for <a href="https://blog.sei.io/sei-the-fastest-l1-for-trading/">exchanging digital assets</a>. Sei’s built-in blockchain <a href="https://github.com/sei-protocol/sei-chain/blob/3c9576fee3494ce039df684624f918dd8066ba3f/whitepaper/Sei_Whitepaper.pdf">technologies</a>, such as Twin-Turbo Consensus and transaction parallelization, enable reduced transaction latency and increased transaction throughput. Sei competes with other alternative Layer-1s such as nascent, non-EVM Layer-1 networks like <a href="https://sui.io/">Sui</a> and <a href="https://aptoslabs.com/">Aptos</a>, incumbents like <a href="https://solana.com/">Solana</a>, and the upcoming parallelized EVM in <a href="https://www.monad.xyz/">Monad</a>. As the network continues to mature, the technological upgrades planned with <a href="https://blog.sei.io/sei-v2-the-first-parallelized-evm/">Sei V2</a> and later with the <a href="https://blog.sei.io/the-parallel-stack/">Parallel Stack</a> will further differentiate Sei and catalyze growth.</p><h2><strong>Background</strong></h2><p>Sei was <a href="https://twitter.com/SeiNetwork/status/1526577915202195456">announced</a> in May 2022 and founded by <a href="https://twitter.com/jayendra_jog">Jayendra Jog</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffdfeng?lang=en">Jeff Feng</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/deeeedle">Dan Edlebeck</a>. Each founder offers unique prior experience, including those gained by serving as a software engineer at <a href="https://www.robinhood.com/us/en/">Robinhood</a>, venture investor at <a href="https://www.coatue.com/">Coatue Management</a>, or founding projects such as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/deedleconnects/about/">deedle connects</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/exidio/about/">Exidio</a>. Following Sei’s announcement, Sei Labs raised $35 million across <a href="https://messari.io/deals/all-funding-rounds?search=Sei+Labs">two rounds</a> and conducted two incentivized testnets.The <a href="https://blog.sei.io/seinami-incentivized-testnet-2/">Seinami Incentivized Testnet</a>, also known as Atlantic-1, went <a href="https://twitter.com/SeiNetwork/status/1546706235722014721">live</a> in July 2022. In March 2023, an upgraded Atlantic-2 testnet went <a href="https://twitter.com/SeiNetwork/status/1635402155069939712?s=20">live</a>. Finally, in August 2023, Sei <a href="https://blog.sei.io/mainnet-is-live/">launched</a> its Pacific-1 mainnet alongside SEI, its <a href="https://sei.explorers.guru/">native token</a> that was <a href="https://blog.sei.io/the-sei-airdrop/">airdropped</a> to eligible users. Since the mainnet launch, network activity has grown, and the onchain ecosystem has expanded with the help of Sei Foundation. Sei Labs is working toward major technological upgrades in the <a href="https://blog.sei.io/sei-v2-public-devnet/">Public Devnet</a> for the upcoming launch of <a href="https://blog.sei.io/sei-v2-the-first-parallelized-evm/">Sei V2</a> in H1 2024.</p><h2><strong>Technology</strong></h2><p>Sei is an integrated, general-purpose Layer-1 network. As an integrated blockchain, Sei combines the responsibilities of execution, settlement, consensus, and data availability into a single network. The blockchain is compatible with Cosmos’ <a href="https://cosmos.network/ibc/">Inter-Blockchain Communication</a> (IBC) protocol and was built through modified forks of the <a href="https://v1.cosmos.network/sdk">Cosmos SDK</a> and <a href="https://tendermint.com/core/">Tendermint Core</a> protocol. Sei’s application layer supports <a href="https://cosmwasm.com/">CosmWasm</a> smart contracts <a href="https://www.docs.sei.io/quickstart/nft-contract-tutorial#requirements">written</a> in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>. Despite being built with Cosmos technologies, Sei is sovereign in both architecture and governance.</p><p>The network’s built-in features enhance transaction efficiency and throughput, supporting Sei’s goal of becoming the fastest network for <a href="https://blog.sei.io/sei-the-fastest-l1-for-trading/">exchanging digital assets</a>. These features include Twin-Turbo Consensus, which serves to reduce transaction latency, and transaction parallelization, which serves to increase transaction throughput. Additionally, an onchain central limit order book (CLOB) supports liquidity across the network, though it’s set to be deprecated. Sei’s <a href="https://github.com/sei-protocol/sei-chain/blob/3c9576fee3494ce039df684624f918dd8066ba3f/whitepaper/Sei_Whitepaper.pdf">initial set</a> of technological features will be expanded upon in the upcoming<a href="https://blog.sei.io/sei-v2-the-first-parallelized-evm/"> Sei V2</a> upgrade.</p><p><em>Note: This Technology section focuses primarily on Sei’s current technology. For a more in-depth look at technological upgrades planned for the upcoming launch of Sei V2, please see the Roadmap section of this report.</em></p><h3><strong>Consensus</strong></h3><p>Sei relies on a <a href="https://www.docs.sei.io/running-validator/validator-faq#what-is-staking">Proof-of-Stake</a> (PoS) protocol based on Tendermint Core, a Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) algorithm used to achieve consensus. <a href="https://www.docs.sei.io/running-validator/what-is-validator">Sei validators</a> process transactions and settle state (account balances, smart contracts, etc.) changes on the network. Validators are selected to produce blocks according to their <a href="https://www.docs.sei.io/running-validator/validator-faq#is-there-a-minimum-amount-of-sei-that-must-be-staked-to-be-an-active-bonded-validator">total stake</a> (self-bonded plus delegated SEI tokens). Anyone that meets the <a href="https://www.docs.sei.io/running-sei-node/quickstart">hardware requirements</a> can <a href="https://www.docs.sei.io/running-validator/validator-faq#how-do-i-become-a-validator">operate</a> a validator node to secure the network. Today, only the <a href="https://sei.explorers.guru/validators">top 39 validators</a> by total stake are able to participate in consensus and earn network transaction fees and staking rewards. An active validator's total stake can be <a href="https://www.docs.sei.io/running-validator/validator-faq#what-are-the-slashing-conditions">slashed</a> and <a href="https://blog.sei.io/staking-on-sei-what-is-it/#:~:text=Crucially%20%2D%20validators%20never%20have%20control%20over%20or%20access%20to%20your%20staked%20tokens.%20However%2C%20if%20a%20validator%20misbehaves%2C%20they%20can%20incur%20economic%20penalties%20known%20as%20%E2%80%9Cslashing%E2%80%9D%20which%20will%20result%20in%20some%20of%20the%20Sei%20tokens%20staked%20to%20them%20being%20burned.">burned</a> if they misbehave. SEI tokenholders can <a href="https://app.sei.io/stake">delegate</a> SEI to an existing validator, enabling delegators to help secure the network. The delegators also share in the associated validator’s SEI rewards, minus the associated validator’s chosen <a href="https://www.docs.sei.io/running-validator/validator-faq#what-is-a-validators-commission">commission</a> rate. Both validators and delegators must wait a <a href="https://sei.explorers.guru/params">21-day unbonding period</a> before fully <a href="https://www.docs.sei.io/running-validator/validator-faq#what-are-the-different-states-a-validator-can-be-in">unbonding</a> SEI that has been <a href="https://app.sei.io/stake">staked</a>. Notably, non-vested tokens can be staked to secure the network.</p><p>Sei also leverages its novel “<a href="https://blog.sei.io/twin-turbo-consensus/">Twin-Turbo Consensus</a>” mechanism that serves to reduce transaction latency through two main components:</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/015520f36045dae510a703b34a5b09c3a0c9fa44-1600x1321.jpg?w=800" /><p>Source: <a href="https://blog.sei.io/twin-turbo-consensus/">Sei Blog</a></p><p><strong>Intelligent Block Propagation</strong>: A block proposer creates a block of transactions that is distributed across the validator set. These blocks are compressed to include hashes of each transaction included in the block. Normally, validators would need to wait for the entire contents of the proposed block to arrive before proceeding with consensus. However, Sei’s design allows individual transactions in a proposed block to be received while validators take advantage of the individual transactions already in their mempools.If all the necessary transactions are held in a mempool, a validator can reconstruct a proposed block locally without waiting to receive the entire contents of the proposed block. This decreases the amount of time validators must wait to reconstruct proposed blocks, decreasing transaction latency.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/4971804c7ce9047fd16055e59ed8f1ee61edc131-1600x533.jpg?w=800" /><p>Source: <a href="https://blog.sei.io/twin-turbo-consensus/">Sei Blog</a></p><p><strong>Optimistic Block Processing</strong>: Normally, validators perform the prevote and precommit steps before coming to consensus on a proposed block and committing it to the blockchain. However, on Sei, the contents of a proposed block are optimistically assumed to be valid once they have been reconstructed by a validator. This processing occurs simultaneous to the prevote and precommit steps. Validators immediately begin to process the first block proposal they receive, even before the blocks are confirmed by consensus. This process helps decrease transaction latency. If the validator set were to fail to reach consensus on the optimistically accepted contents of a proposed block, the network would reject the block, and future rounds for that block height would not use optimistic block processing.Notably, Intelligent Block Propagation and Optimistic Block Processing come with the tradeoff of Quadratic Communication Complexity. In other words, the number of messages sent between the validator set increases exponentially, making it difficult to increase the maximum validator set size due to increased bandwidth and processing requirements.</p><h3><strong>Execution</strong></h3><p>Many blockchains have a sequential transaction engine, where transactions are ordered and executed one by one. To speed up execution, transactions on Sei can be executed in parallel, allowing smart contracts to operate without interference from each other. This results in reduced network congestion and increased transaction throughput. Today, parallelization on Sei is optional and pessimistic. To take advantage of Sei’s parallelization capabilities, smart contract developers must define the state (account balances, smart contracts, etc.) that smart contracts use. If not defined, transactions are processed sequentially. If defined, “dependency mappings” are maintained for the network to know (1) which transactions can be run in parallel, independent of one another, and (2) which transactions cannot be run in parallel because they depend on each other. These dependency mappings are created through <a href="https://www.okx.com/learn/directed-acyclic-graph-explained">Directed Acyclic Graphs</a> (DAG). If dependencies between transactions are found to exist (i.e., they read/write the same location within Sei’s state), they are processed sequentially, making execution on Sei “hybridized.”</p><h2><strong>Roadmap</strong></h2><p>In November 2023, Sei announced its plans for <a href="https://blog.sei.io/sei-v2-the-first-parallelized-evm/">Sei V2</a>, which will introduce <a href="https://twitter.com/phillip_xyz/status/1767537726901907668">three major upgrades</a> to the network. In February 2024, Sei launched its <a href="https://blog.sei.io/sei-v2-public-devnet/">Public Devnet</a> to test Sei V2 functionality. The upgrade is <a href="https://blog.sei.io/sei-v2-the-first-parallelized-evm/#:~:text=Sei%E2%80%99s%20major%20upgrade%20is%20nearly%20code%20complete%20right%20now.%20Once%20audits%20are%20complete%2C%20this%20upgrade%20will%20be%20released%20in%20a%20public%20testnet%20in%20Q1%202024%2C%20and%20will%20get%20deployed%20to%20mainnet%20sometime%20in%20H1%202024.%C2%A0">expected</a> to be deployed to mainnet sometime in H1 2024. Lastly, once Sei V2 goes live, the team plans to launch Sei’s Parallel Stack, which would enable Layer-2 networks rolling up to Sei.</p><h3><strong>Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Integration</strong></h3><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/fd0d28adeafb0ff805ce4deb401bd6a711794329-1600x900.jpg?w=800" /><p></p><p>Source: <a href="https://blog.sei.io/sei-v2-the-first-parallelized-evm/">Sei Blog</a></p><p>Sei V2 <a href="https://forum.sei.io/t/evm-integration/37?ref=blog.sei.io">plans</a> to introduce compatibility for <a href="https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/evm">EVM</a> smart contracts written in <a href="https://soliditylang.org/">Solidity</a>, including the ERC-20 and ERC-721 token standards. EVM smart contracts will also be backward compatible, meaning that smart contracts on Ethereum and its Layer-2 networks can be seamlessly redeployed on Sei. </p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/4764331f03444c0099c80e4fc50e5071d50122a5-1600x900.jpg?w=800" /><p>Source: <a href="https://blog.sei.io/sei-v2-the-first-parallelized-evm/">Sei Blog</a></p><p>In effect, Sei will simultaneously support two execution environments. Also, each user’s EVM and Wasm addresses will be linked and will share the same underlying account. EVM smart contracts and tokens will be <a href="https://blog.sei.io/sei-v2-interoperability/">interoperable</a> with existing CosmWasm smart contracts, and vice versa, through the use of <a href="https://v2.docs.sei.io/interoperability/pointer-contracts?ref=blog.sei.io">Pointer Contracts</a> and <a href="https://v2.docs.sei.io/interoperability/overview#precompiled-contracts">Precompiled Contracts</a>.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/dcb73c5a036f2c6fc1dd51772f5db7ab5ba78e32-1123x711.jpg?w=800" /><p>Source: <a href="https://v2.docs.sei.io/interoperability/pointer-contracts?ref=blog.sei.io">Sei GitBook</a></p><p>These contracts will make tokens accessible in both environments without needing a wrapped version of the token. In essence, Pointer Contracts act as a “translator” between the two execution environments. They allow users to signal what messages they want to send across either environment. With the introduction of EVM compatibility, Sei would become a suitable destination for cross-chain EVM protocols to be deployed on. Many of the leading protocols on Ethereum also exist on other EVM-compatible networks. This upgrade could lead to EVM infrastructure and DeFi protocols being deployed on Sei, bootstrapping a robust EVM ecosystem on the network. The upgrade will also allow EVM developers to be able to build on the network. Per Electric Capital’s <a href="https://www.developerreport.com/reports/devs/2023?s=87-of-multi-chain-devs-work&amp;ref=blog.sei.io">2023 Developer Report</a>, 87% of multichain developers work on at least one EVM chain. This previously inaccessible developer ecosystem will be able to take advantage of Sei’s enhanced transaction efficiency and throughput to create novel EVM applications that are native to Sei. Evidence of this can already be seen through the <a href="https://v2.docs.sei.io/interacting-with-sei/ecosystem-apps">EVM applications</a> being built on Sei’s Public Devnet.</p><h3><strong>Optimistic Parallelization</strong></h3><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/ccc3a3f6fc1f8cb4a9e86ccc907b6a491971e356-1600x900.jpg?w=800" /><p>Source: <a href="https://blog.sei.io/sei-v2-the-first-parallelized-evm/">Sei Blog</a></p><p>Parallelization on Sei is currently optional. To take advantage of Sei’s parallelization capabilities, smart contract developers must define the state (account balances, smart contracts, etc.) that smart contracts use. Sei v2 <a href="https://forum.sei.io/t/optimistic-concurrency-control/28?ref=blog.sei.io">plans</a> to change from pessimistic parallelization by introducing optimistic parallelization, where all transactions will optimistically be assumed to be eligible for parallel processing. Similar to Sei’s optimistic block processing fallback, if dependencies between transactions exist (transactions interacting with the same part of Sei’s state), they will be re-processed sequentially. The change to optimistic parallelization will ease the developer experience by not requiring dependency mappings to be defined.</p><h3><strong>SeiDB</strong></h3><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/78abc581cb149fe4c6d062007b80e5474cdce62c-1600x900.jpg?w=800" /><p>Source: <a href="https://blog.sei.io/sei-db-the-numbers/">Sei Blog</a></p><p>Sei V2 <a href="https://forum.sei.io/t/seidb-improving-long-term-storage/22">plans</a> to <a href="https://github.com/sei-protocol/sei-db?tab=readme-ov-file#architecture">re-architecture</a> the network’s storage interface. <a href="https://blog.sei.io/sei-db-the-numbers/#:~:text=Enter%20SeiDB%3A%20Faster%20Storage%20for%20the%20Fastest%20Blockchain">SeiDB</a> would introduce a new <a href="https://github.com/sei-protocol/sei-db">storage layer</a> on Sei that decouples the <a href="https://github.com/sei-protocol/sei-db?tab=readme-ov-file#state-commitment-sc-layer">State Commitment (SC) Layer</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sei-protocol/sei-db?tab=readme-ov-file#state-store-ss-layer">State Store (SS) Layer</a>.

Modular blockchains emerged throughout 2022 with launches of Ethereum Layer-2s that specialized as execution layers. In 2023, networks specialized as DA layers began to launch. Sei plans to join the modular blockchain arena once Sei v2 is live and Sei is EVM-compatible. Specifically, Sei’s upcoming open-source <a href="https://blog.sei.io/the-parallel-stack/">Parallel Stack</a> is planned to enable developers to launch modular, Layer-2 blockchains that serve as parallel EVM execution layers.

These staked tokens earn liquid SEI token rewards and have the ability to participate in governance and secure the network.</p><h3><strong>Governance</strong></h3><p>Sei uses an onchain governance process where proposals can affect network parameters. These include parameters related to SEI’s <a href="https://github.com/sei-protocol/sei-chain/tree/main/x/mint#updating-the-minting-schedule">minting schedule</a> or <a href="https://sei.explorers.guru/proposal/37">increasing</a> the maximum set of active validators. Sei’s governance does not have an official voting front end, but it can be interacted with through supported wallets such as Fin Wallet and Compass Wallet. The governance process is as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Create a Proposal</strong>: Proposals can be <a href="https://www.docs.sei.io/governance#creating-a-new-proposal">created</a> to initiate a two-day deposit period where SEI can be deposited to support the pending proposal. Once a minimum deposit threshold of 3,500 SEI ($2,400 as of April 9, 2024) is met, the proposal moves to an onchain vote. Expedited proposals are possible by using the “is-expedited” flag, which halves the deposit period to one day but doubles the minimum deposit threshold to 7,000 SEI ($4,800 as of April 9, 2024).</li><li><strong>Deposit Period</strong>: SEI can be <a href="https://www.docs.sei.io/governance#deposit-for-proposal">deposited</a> to support a pending proposal. If the minimum deposit threshold is met, the proposal moves to an onchain vote. If the minimum deposit threshold is not met prior to the deposit period ending, the proposal is canceled, and all deposits are burned.</li><li><strong>Vote on Proposal</strong>: Users that stake SEI can <a href="https://www.docs.sei.io/governance#voting-on-proposals">vote</a> on an <a href="https://sei.explorers.guru/proposals">active proposal</a> with one of the following vote types: “yes,” ”no,” “no_with_veto,” or “abstain.” Voting power is equivalent to each user’s respective stake. The voting period is five days, and a quorum of 33% of the staked token supply is required. A simple majority of at least 50% of voting power used on a proposal must vote “yes” to approve the proposal. If over 33% of the total voting power is used to select “no_with_veto,” the proposal will fail regardless of the other votes.</li></ul><p>As of April 9, 2024, 48 out of 53 active proposals have passed since Sei’s mainnet launch. These have included several small <a href="https://sei.explorers.guru/proposal/37">increases</a> to the maximum set of active validators, increasing governance deposit parameters, <a href="https://sei.explorers.guru/proposal/50">updating</a> the minimum network transaction fee, and <a href="https://sei.explorers.guru/proposal/51">upgrading</a> network software. Notably, non-vested tokens are able to be staked to participate in governance.</p><h2><strong>State of the Sei Ecosystem</strong></h2><p>Since Sei’s mainnet launch in August 2023, protocols across various sectors have launched and grown the network’s <a href="https://www.sei.io/ecosystem">ecosystem</a>:</p><ul><li><strong>DeFi</strong>: With a <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Sei">total value locked</a> (TVL) of ~$38.7 million on Sei as of April 9, 2024, Sei lags behind competitors <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Solana">Solana</a> (~$4.45 billion in TVL), <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Sui">Sui</a> (~$670.92 million in TVL), and <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Aptos">Aptos</a> (~$453.05 million in TVL).

Additionally, ecosystem growth is also continually spurred through several programs:</p><ul><li><strong>Ecosystem Fund</strong>: In September 2022, Sei <a href="https://blog.sei.io/sei-launches-50m-ecosystem-and-liquidity-fund/">announced</a> an “Ecosystem and Liquidity Fund” to help early-stage founders and teams acquire users and expand. The Fund launched with $50 million in funding sponsored by Multicoin Capital, Flow Traders, Hudson River Trading, and others. In January 2023, an additional $20 million was <a href="https://blockworks.co/news/sei-network-with-70m-in-ecosystem-funding-looks-east">secured</a> from <a href="https://www.mexc.com/">MEXC Global</a>. Most recently, in April 2023, another $50 million was <a href="https://blog.sei.io/foresight-ventures-brings-sei-ecosystem-fund-to-120-million-catalyzing-web3-growth-and-innovation/">secured</a> from <a href="https://www.foresightventures.com/">Foresight Ventures</a>.</li><li><strong>Creator Fund</strong>: In April 2024, Sei <a href="https://blog.sei.io/creator-fund/">announced</a> a creator fund focused on both new and existing NFT and social projects. This fund is in collaboration with Gitcoin, an established leader in community funding for multiple ecosystems.</li><li><strong>Sei Launchpad Program (“sei/acc program”)</strong>: Managed by Sei Foundation, this <a href="https://blog.sei.io/sei-acc/">program</a> aims to support founders building on Sei through mentorship and investment. Interested parties can apply <a href="https://sei-forms.typeform.com/to/FALPgCRO?ref=blog.sei.io&amp;typeform-source=t.co">here</a>.</li><li><strong>Ecosystem Reserve</strong>: Sei's Ecosystem Reserve is partially <a href="https://blog.sei.io/seis-future-proofed-tokenomics-setting-the-scene-sei-is-an-open-source-permissionless-layer-1-blockchain-specifically-designed-in-response-to-the-fundamental-use-case-of-blockchains-the/#:~:text=Community%20Tokens%3A,as%20%E2%80%9CSeason%201%E2%80%9D.">allocated</a> for funding ecosystem initiatives, airdrops, and incentives. No additional ecosystem initiatives, airdrops, or incentives have begun since SEI’s token genesis. However, Sei Foundation continues to have these tokens that could be used to spur future growth of the network and its ecosystem.</li></ul><h2><strong>Closing Summary</strong></h2><p>Sei, a Layer-1 blockchain, aims to be the fastest network for exchanging digital assets. It features novel technological features built into its blockchain. Namely, Twin-Turbo Consensus and transaction parallelization, which increase transaction efficiency and throughput. Since launching its mainnet in August 2023, Sei has seen an ecosystem of native projects launch and a community emerge. To maintain momentum, Sei must successfully deploy the features planned for the Sei V2 upgrade. EVM compatibility could unlock new opportunities by expanding Sei’s developer ecosystem and enabling established EVM protocols to deploy on Sei. Optimistic transaction parallelization will ease the developer experience, while SeiDB improves the network’s performance across the board. Post-V2, sights can be set on the Parallel Stack. The stack could enable further growth in Sei’s ecosystem and validator usage as Layer-2 EVM rollups are launched by developers seeking an improved user experience and novel design space. All these planned features could lead to more activity on the network as it continues to mature and differentiate itself from other competing Layer-1 networks.</p></div>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。zkLink致力于解决区块链流动性和技术堆栈碎片化挑战，通过统一Layer-2（L2）网络和Layer-1（L1）网络。他们提供了两个核心解决方案：zkLink Nova和zkLink X。zkLink Nova是一个通用的Layer-3（L3）网络， consol。资产，流动性和dApps从以太坊L2s到一个单一、安全和高效的EVM兼容平台。zkLink X 是一个应用程序特定的扩展引擎，用于多链dApp部署、流动性聚合和改善各种区块链网络的性能，包括L1s和L2s。zkLink Nova已经桥接了超过3亿美元，成为总价值最高的L3网络。这些信息显示zkLink在解决区块链碎片化挑战方面取得了进展。 <div>
<div><h2><strong>Key Insights</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>zkLink addresses blockchain liquidity and technology stack fragmentation challenges</strong> by unifying Layer-2 (L2) networks and Layer-1 (L1s) networks.</li><li><strong>zkLink offers two core solutions: zkLink Nova and zkLink X.</strong> Both solutions leverage zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) technology to offer users and developers unified access to connected networks.</li><li><strong>zkLink Nova is a general-purpose Layer-3 (L3) network</strong> that consolidates assets, liquidity, and dApps from Ethereum L2s into a single, secure, and efficient EVM-compatible platform.</li><li><strong>zkLink X is an application-specific scaling engine</strong> for multichain dApp deployment, liquidity aggregation, and improved performance across various blockchain networks, including L1s and L2s.</li><li><strong>Over $300 million has been bridged to zkLink Nova</strong>, making it the largest L3 network by total value bridged.</li></ul><h2>Background</h2><p>Layer-2s scale Ethereum at the cost of operating as isolated sub-ecosystems that weaken Ethereum’s network effect. L2s vary widely, leveraging different technology stacks (e.g., OP Stack or ZK Stack) and diverse proof techniques (e.g., fraud or validity proof). As such, L2s can have the drawbacks of further fragmenting liquidity on Ethereum and complicating dApp development. They can also degrade the user experience as transfers across L2s can be time-consuming and expensive. Today’s blockchain landscape is characterized by siloed independent L1s that can barely communicate value beyond asset transfers and cross-chain messages via bridges. </p><p><a href="https://zk.link/">zkLink</a> aims to unify L2s and L1s, enhancing user experience and secure dApp development with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP). zkLink offers two core solutions:</p><ol><li><strong><a href="https://zk.link/nova">zkLink Nova</a>:</strong> A universal L3 focused on addressing Ethereum’s liquidity and asset fragmentation challenges</li><li><a href="https://zk.link/X"><strong>zkLink X</strong></a>: An application-specific scaling engine that enables customized multichain dApp development, connecting L2s and L1s. </li></ol><p>zkLink <a href="https://medium.com/morningstar-ventures/founder-story-vince-yang-zklink-3dfc956d9900">began</a> in 2021 as a multichain trading solution. It leveraged ZKPs to offer users reliable access to aggregated liquidity and empower developers to quickly deploy customizable and secure financial applications like DEXs and AMMs. Over the years, zkLink has evolved into a stack-agnostic aggregator of assets, liquidity, and applications across various L1s and Ethereum L2s, fostering an interconnected blockchain landscape. Led by Vince Yang, zkLink Labs (the team behind zkLink) has <a href="https://blog.zk.link/looking-back-beyond-zklinks-2023-annual-review-fb99f21e062d#:~:text=This%20brought%20our%20total%20funding%20to%20%2418.5M">secured</a> $23.1 million from private investors and completed a <a href="https://blog.zk.link/announcing-our-community-token-sale-on-coinlist-the-zklink-explorer-whitelist-0a4672e6b9d1">community</a> sale to fund zkLink’s development.</p><p>On March 11, 2024, zkLink Nova’s Layer-3 public <a href="https://blog.zk.link/zklink-nova-launches-public-mainnet-pioneering-aggregated-layer-3-rollup-networks-419cd254a8a9">mainnet went</a> live, supporting nine networks including Ethereum. It offers users and developers an interoperable platform that consolidates liquidity and assets from Ethereum L2s. Users can deposit assets once on zkLink Nova to interact with assets and dApps from all connected L2s, eliminating duplicate dApp interactions on these networks while enjoying lower fees. Similarly, developers can quickly deploy more capital-efficient applications on the L3, tapping into the liquidity of connected L2s without multiple dApp deployments. Since launching in early March 2024, zkLink Nova has <a href="https://explorer.zklink.io/">attracted</a> over $300 million in total value locked (TVL), signaling a potential demand for a unified general-purpose L3 platform. <a href="https://zkex.com/">ZKEX</a> was the first application-specific decentralized exchange (DEX) built using zkLink X. As of March 2024, ZKEX is live in V2 Alpha mainnet with a transaction volume of over $42 million.</p><h2>Technology</h2><h3><strong>zkLink Nova</strong></h3><p><a href="https://zk.link/nova">zkLink Nova</a> is a <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/zk-rollups/">zero-knowledge</a> rollup (ZK-rollup) that operates as a general-purpose L3 built on Ethereum and its L2s. It leverages <a href="https://docs.zklink.io/architecture/execution-layer">ZK Stack</a> and <a href="https://docs.zklink.io/architecture/settlement-layer/in-detail-multi-chain-state-synchronization#:~:text=zkLink%20Nova%20is%20powered%20by%20zkLink%20Nexus%20technology%20for%20multi%2Dchain%20settlement.%20In%20zkLink%27s%20Nexus%2C">zkLink Nexus</a> technology to <a href="https://blog.zk.link/zklink-nova-asset-aggregation-its-practical-use-cases-bcdafed69431#:~:text=There%20are%20three%20facets%20to%20asset%20aggregation%3A%20ETH%20Native%20Unification%2C%20ERC%2D20%20Token%20Aggregation%2C%20and%20Stablecoin%20Merge.">aggregate</a> liquidity and assets across connected networks. It also provides a customizable and scalable dApp deployment environment due to its <a href="https://docs.zklink.io/architecture/key-components">modular design</a>. zkLink Nova’s modular architecture is composed of four layers:</p><h4><strong>Sequencing</strong></h4><p>The <a href="https://docs.zklink.io/architecture/sequencing-layer">sequencing layer</a> is primarily tasked with monitoring onchain deposits into the L3’s smart contracts, maintaining the L3’s state, and organizing transactions for processing and proof generation. Users can interact with zkLink Nova by depositing assets on its smart contracts deployed on all connected chains or directly to the L3’s sequencer via an RPC service. zkLink Nova’s sequencer records incoming transactions according to the requirements of the L3’s proving system while discarding ineligible transactions. Approved transactions are grouped into small blocks for processing within the L3’s zkEVM every two seconds. Transaction blocks are further compiled as batches to minimize the costs associated with interacting with the settlement layers. As of writing, the protocol’s sequencer is centrally managed by the project team, although the long-term goal is to adopt decentralized sequencer solutions like <a href="https://www.espressosys.com/">Espresso</a>, <a href="https://www.astria.org/">Astria</a>, and <a href="https://www.fairblock.network/">Fairblock</a>.<br /></p><h4><strong>Execution</strong></h4><p>Transactions that update the L3 state are <a href="https://docs.zklink.io/architecture/execution-layer">executed</a> on this layer. zkLink Nova leverages ZK Stack’s zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine (<a href="https://zkstack.io/components#zkEVM:~:text=Stack%20modules%20today%3F-,zkEVM,compatible%2C%20tailored%20for%20ZK%2C%20and%20including%20enhancements%20like%20Native%20Account%20Abstraction.,-Virtual%20machine">zkEVM</a>) to execute transactions. The zkEVM provides a secure execution environment for zkLink Nova’s smart contracts, verifying every step of the program’s execution with ZKPs. As such, the L3 can execute transactions verified with ZKP computations in an EVM-compatible environment, enabling developers to easily deploy dApps live on Ethereum and other L2s to the L3. </p><h4><strong>Settlement</strong></h4><p>zkLink Nova’s proprietary settlement framework, <a href="https://docs.zklink.io/architecture/settlement-layer/in-detail-multi-chain-state-synchronization">zkLink Nexus</a>, enables settlement across multiple L2s and Ethereum, unlike traditional ZK-rollups that settle on Ethereum. This way, the L3 can efficiently aggregate all user deposits to its smart contracts on other L2s without recomputing proofs. thanks to its stack-agnostic nature, zkLink Nova can connect to all Ethereum L2s regardless of technology stack (e.g., ZK or OP L2s). To settle transactions across multiple chains, zkLink Nexus leverages <a href="https://docs.zklink.io/architecture/settlement-layer/in-detail-multi-chain-state-synchronization">multichain state synchronization</a>, a settlement framework that delegates the responsibilities of validating proofs to one chain and communicating chain states to other chains.</p><ul><li>One connected L2 is selected as a “<a href="https://docs.zklink.io/architecture/settlement-layer/in-detail-multi-chain-state-synchronization#:~:text=serving%20different%20roles%3A-,Primary%20Chain%3A,-ZK%2Dproofs%20and">primary chain</a>” for verifying and executing ZKPs and ensuring onchain transaction consistency.</li><li>The other connected L2s serve as “<a href="https://docs.zklink.io/architecture/settlement-layer/in-detail-multi-chain-state-synchronization#:~:text=by%20sync%20hashes.-,Secondary%20Chain,-%3A%20Secondary%20chains%20send">secondary chains</a>” that only need to communicate state syncs computed by the L3’s verifier contracts to the primary chain without computing any ZKPs.</li></ul><p>As of writing, <a href="https://linea.build/">Linea</a> is zkLink Nova’s primary chain due to its ability to execute <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06877">zk-SNARK</a> proofs and its fast settlement finality on Ethereum. The L3 also <a href="https://docs.zklink.io/key-concepts/total-value-locked-tvl#:~:text=all%20base%20chains-,zkLink%20contract%20addresses%20deployed%20on%20different%20networks,-Ethereum%3A%200x5fD9F73286b7E8683Bab45019C94553b93e015Cf">supports</a> Ethereum as a secondary chain and the following L2s: Manta, Mantle, zkSync Era, Arbitrum, Blast, Optimism, and Base.</p><p>The settlement process begins when the sequencer submits transaction batches and zk-proofs to the primary chain for validation. Using zkLink Nexus' <a href="https://docs.zklink.io/architecture/settlement-layer/in-detail-multi-chain-state-synchronization">multichain state synchronization</a>, the secondary chains send sync hashes to the primary chain via canonical rollup bridges to ensure proof consistency, concluding the verification process.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/b1d841c460c23dc64f9a02472490aa08e9f3b665-1600x917.jpg?w=800" /><p></p><p>Building a multichain rollup introduces the risk of deposit fraud. A malicious sequencer could report a fake deposit on a secondary chain to the primary chain, potentially resulting in the loss of user funds.</p><p>To mitigate this, the state synchronization phase includes an extra transaction verification layer beyond the standard ZKP verification process employed in typical ZK-rollups. This added layer confirms that the real-time data submitted by the sequencer to the primary chain corresponds with the sync hashes periodically transmitted by secondary chains. Once verification is complete, the primary chain allows for settlement, leading to soft finalization. Then the batch roots are distributed to secondary chains for withdrawal processing, thus securing the network against fraud.</p><h4><strong>Data Availability</strong></h4><p>Transaction and state transition data are <a href="https://docs.zklink.io/architecture/da-layer">accessible</a> on the data availability (DA) layer. As of writing, zkLink operates as a Validium, storing transaction data offchain with a Data Availability Committee (DAC). The DAC maintains a copy of the L3’s transaction data and its state history, storing transaction data cost-effectively, especially for ZK-rollups that also incur proof verification costs. However, DACs do not offer as much security as external DA solutions that are secured by specialized DA networks. Hence, zkLink Nova intends to leverage external DA solutions like Celestia and EigenDA in the future.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/97b7aaf70392e0445255545566189dafa3a9c09e-1600x893.jpg?w=800" /><p><strong>Asset Aggregation on zkLink Nova</strong>To access zkLink Nova, users must first bridge assets from Ethereum and other connected L2s to the L3 via a <a href="https://docs.linea.build/architecture/bridges/canonical-token-bridge">canonical</a> rollup bridge. Once on zkLink Nova, assets can be aggregated for interoperable transactions. Tokens of identical value from different networks can be merged into a single token to consolidate liquidity. zkLink Nova leverages zk-SNARKs and zkLink Nexus (multi-rollup state synchronization) to securely aggregate assets from all the connected networks. These features enable users to deposit and bridge:</p><ul><li>ETH from various connected networks to the L3. A unified native asset enables withdrawals without third-party bridges similar to withdrawals from a centralized exchange but without the counterparty risk.</li><li>Native assets of other L2s, (e.g., ARB from Arbitrum) to the L3. This allows for interoperable trading of native L2 assets on Nova, enhancing capital efficiency and enabling new DeFi use cases.</li><li>Stablecoins issued on different networks into a single stablecoin on the L3, simplifying the use of stablecoins while minimizing gas fees.<br /></li></ul><p><strong>Merging Tokens on zkLink Nova</strong></p><p>Assets of the same value and kind on multiple L2s have different token addresses. For instance, ETH bridged from Arbtrum and Optimism to zkLink Nova has two unique addresses. For users to interact with ETH bridged from both networks as a single asset on the L3, both unique assets must be merged into one.&nbsp;</p><p>To address this issue of asset non-uniformity, zkLink Nova employs an upgradeable token merge contract governed by a <a href="https://docs.zklink.io/how-it-works/token-merge#governance-committee">Governance Committee</a> and a <a href="https://docs.zklink.io/how-it-works/token-merge#security-council">Security Council</a>. This contract allows it to merge tokens of the same value into one token. Users bridging similar tokens with different addresses from multiple networks can lock source tokens via the token merge contract on origin chains to receive a derivative equivalent to the locked asset on zkLink Nova. Conversely, users can redeem locked tokens by burning the derivative equivalent via the token merge contract. However, the protocol imposes a deposit cap on supported assets, and source tokens can be locked via governance as a safeguard measure.</p><p>Changes to the token merge contracts are introduced and implemented via its governing bodies: the Governance Committee and the Security Council. These changes may include but are not limited to:</p><ul><li>Upgrades to the token merge contracts</li><li>Adding merge support for a source token</li><li>Changing the deposit cap for a supported asset</li><li>Locking or unlocking a source token on the origin chains</li></ul><p>While the Governance Committee initiates and votes on proposal upgrades to the token merge contract via a 2-of-3 multisig, the Security Council retains the right to veto such proposals. The Security Council ultimately oversees the operations of the Governing Committee and reserves the right to implement low-risk upgrades to the token merge contract.<br /></p><h3>zkLink X</h3><p><a href="https://zk.link/X">zkLink X</a> is an application-specific engine for deploying high-performance applications (e.g., financial applications like AMMs and DEXs) across multiple networks. Interoperability between different L1s and Ethereum L2s continues to improve with the emergence of cross-chain bridging solutions attempting to connect these networks. Yet, users are still faced with the challenge of moving and managing assets across these diverse networks with different technology stacks and tooling. Similarly, developers must deploy applications on multiple networks with different execution environments that sometimes require technical knowledge of diverse programming languages and tooling infrastructure. </p><p>zkLink X streamlines the dApp development process and offers developers a unified point for deploying applications with access to extensive liquidity across multiple networks. It enables dApp users to easily access, trade, and manage their assets across L2s and L1s through a single capital-efficient platform. zkLink X is a modularized deployment solution that allows developers to easily customize App Rollups across execution, settlement, DA, and sequencing layers for diverse application needs. Hence, developers can deploy high-performance applications and customize the above components by:</p><ul><li><a href="https://docs.zk.link/architecture/sequencing-layer">Leveraging</a> decentralized sequencers like Espresso, Astria, and Fairblock.</li><li><a href="https://docs.zk.link/architecture/execution-layer">Executing</a> transactions using zkLink’s proprietary <a href="https://docs.zk.link/architecture/execution-layer/ts-zkvm-for-app-rollup#id-4.1.1-storage-sub-layer-of-ts-zkvm">Trading Specific zkVM</a>, designed for high-performance financial products like CLOB, AMMs, and DEXs.</li><li><a href="https://docs.zk.link/architecture/settlement-layer">Settling</a> transactions to either of zkLink X’s proprietary settlement frameworks: <a href="https://docs.zk.link/architecture/settlement-layer/nexus-settlement-on-eth-l2s">Nexus</a> or <a href="https://docs.zk.link/architecture/settlement-layer/origin-settlement-on-eth-and-alt-l1s">Origin</a>. With Nexus, transactions can be settled on Ethereum and its L2s, whereas Origin enables settlement on alternate L1s like Avalanche or Solana. Additionally, Nexus verifies the transaction state across all connected L2s with multichain state synchronization, while Origin verifies the same across all connected L1s and L2s via a <a href="https://docs.zk.link/architecture/settlement-layer/multi-chain-state-synchronization#:~:text=3.%20Origin%20solution,message%20transfer%20process.">Light Oracle Network</a>.</li><li><a href="https://docs.zk.link/architecture/da-layer">Utilizing</a> external DA solutions like Celestia and Eigen DA to store transaction and state data.</li></ul><p>One notable application-specific rollup built leveraging zkLink X is <a href="https://zkex.com/">ZKEX</a>, a decentralized exchange with aggregated liquidity from alternative L1s like BNB Smart Chain and L2s like Starknet. Users can trade multichain assets from supported networks on the application without having to bridge multiple assets. Users also enjoy a streamlined user experience as they can deposit these multichain assets into the DEX from a single self-custodial wallet (e.g., MetaMask). <br /></p><h2>Tokenomics</h2><p>zkLink’s native token, <a href="https://zklinkblog.medium.com/zkl-token-overview-e121ddc0127c?source=user_profile---------21----------------------------">ZKL</a>, is scheduled for a 2024 release, although a definite release date has yet to be announced. ZKL will grant users access to zkLink’s rollup infrastructure service and grant tokenholders governance over the zkLink project. The asset’s planned functions include: </p><ul><li><strong>Staking</strong>: Provers will stake ZKL to access zkLink’s proof generation market, where dApps request proof generation services. Subsequently, provers can earn ZKL rewards for completing these tasks.</li><li><strong>Payments</strong>: ZKL will be the primary payment token for zkLink’s proof generation market. dApps leveraging zkLink’s rollup infrastructure will pay provers in ZKL for ZKP generation services. Also, application-specific rollups built using zkLink’s rollup infrastructure will pay infrastructure fees in ZKP to zkLink DAO, the project’s proposed governance organization. These dApps may also adopt ZKL for fees used to pay for specific in-app offerings.</li><li><strong>Governance</strong>: Through a future zkLink DAO, ZKL tokenholders will exercise governance rights over the direction and development of zkLink.</li></ul><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/569edba680340428765f2adad3125d18182ddb25-1600x868.jpg?w=800" /><p></p><p>ZKL will launch with a maximum token supply of 1 billion without inflation. The token’s allocation is as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Community Treasury </strong>(~29.88%): The community treasury governed by the future zkLink DAO will control the most significant portion of the total token supply. About 20.75% of this allocation will be released at TGE and distributed as rewards to early adopters and as community development and bug bounty rewards to contributing developers. An additional ~9.37% reserved for bug bounties will vest monthly over a year. The remaining ~79.25% will be distributed in the future at the discretion of the DAO.</li><li><strong>Ecosystem development </strong>(22.5%): Dedicated to ecosystem development and will be used to fund growth initiatives and development programs. Of this allocation, 20% will be released at TGE, while the remaining 80% will vest monthly for two years.</li><li><strong>Early Private Purchasers</strong> (20.55%): To be distributed to private investors across all funding rounds. About 38.93% of this allocation is reserved for pre-seed inventors and is subject to a 5-month lock-up, and a 27-month linear vesting schedule. Another ~37.98% of this allocation is reserved for seed round investors and is subject to a 4-month lock-up and a 27-month linear vesting schedule. The remaining, ~22.87% is reserved for private round participants and is subject to a 3-month lock-up and a 27-month linear vesting schedule.</li><li><strong>Team and Advisors</strong> (20.00%): For the project team operating as zkLink Labs and the project’s advisors. This allocation is subject to a 6-month lock-up and a monthly linear vesting schedule for 3 years.</li><li><strong>Liquidity Reserve</strong> (4.00%): Will be locked in a liquidity pool at TGE. 50.00% of this allocation will be released at TGE and a monthly linear vesting for a year.</li><li><strong>CoinList Sale</strong> (~3.13%): For zkLink’s CoinList Community Sale participants. 30.00% unlock of this allocation will be released at TGE, followed by a 9-month linear vesting.</li></ul><h3>Aggregation Parade</h3><p>Shortly after its mainnet launch in March 2024, zkLink Nova unveiled the <a href="https://blog.zk.link/aggregation-parade-7997d31ca8e1">Aggregation Parade</a> in partnership with multiple Ethereum L2s (Arbitrum, zkSync, Manta, Mantle, and Linea). The program aims to boost ecosystem participation on zkLink Nova, rewarding participants with NOVA points (NP) for performing the following operations on the L3: </p><ul><li><strong>Bridging:</strong> Users must deposit a minimum of 0.1 ETH from supported L2s to the L3 to accumulate NPs and receive a soul-bound token (SBT). Early deposits attract additional points.</li><li><strong>Participating in zkLink’s NFT referral program</strong>: Users can refer three other users to the L3 to receive one of four unique trademark NFTs.</li><li>Upon acquiring all four unique trademark NFTs, users can upgrade initially awarded SBTs to a Nova Lynks NFT. Nova Lynks NFT holders qualify for a share of a community pool allocated 10 million ZKL.</li><li><strong>Staking</strong>: Users can stake supported assets like ETH, wBTC, USDC, other L2 tokens, liquid staking tokens, and liquid restaking tokens on the network to accumulate NPs. Staking points are accrued based on a token class multiplier schedule, group staking milestones, and an early bird bonus multiplier for early staking participants.</li></ul><p>Since its <a href="https://explorer.zklink.io/">mainnet launch</a> in early March 2024, zkLink Nova has attracted over ~$300 million in TVL, signaling a growing demand for a unified general-purpose L3 platform.<br /></p><h2>Ecosystem</h2><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/89a921a69f4c9e351614532d43793f9555098fb2-1600x928.jpg?w=800" /><p>Source: <a href="https://twitter.com/zkLinkNova/status/1773286959726924137">zkLink Nova “X”</a></p><p>As of writing, there are over <a href="https://zklink.io/ecosystem/">60 projects</a> within zkLink Nova’s ecosystem across DeFi, tooling, social, gaming, and NFTs. zkLink Nova continues to promote ecosystem participation through rewards and grants programs and initiatives that support developers, users, and L2s deploying on the L3.</p><p>Upon TGE, earlier ecosystem participants will be <a href="https://galxe.com/zkLink">rewarded</a> ZKL tokens based on a loyalty points system <a href="https://blog.zk.link/announcing-the-new-zklink-loyalty-points-system-6c6067a659">introduced</a> in August 2023. zkLink Labs also <a href="https://blog.zk.link/zklink-liquidity-alliance-program-an-initiative-to-enhance-the-zk-trading-experience-411df347ca88">introduced</a> the Liquidity Alliance Program in December 2023, partnering with market makers like Skynet, Asymmetries, EF, Keyrock, Wintermute, Selini, and Flowdesk to supply liquidity to DeFi applications on zkLink Nova. In return for providing liquidity, market makers will also share an undisclosed portion of ZKL’s total token supply. </p><p>On March 8, 2024, zkLink Labs announced its <a href="https://blog.zk.link/introducing-the-zklink-ecosystem-developer-grants-program-63bb0ef27b09">developer grants program</a>. The program will support the development of applications on the L3, focusing on DEX-AMMs, lending platforms, data indexers, oracles, bridges, and yield optimizers, among others. zkLink Labs set aside 20 million ZKL (2% of the total token supply) for the grants program, and each successful applicant will receive a maximum of 50,000 ZKL in grant awards.</p><p>To encourage ongoing research in advancing L3 development, zkLink periodically hosts <a href="https://blog.zk.link/all-about-the-zklink-l3-summit-the-leading-technical-forum-for-layer-3-blockchain-solutions-bc7fdeda1e3a">L3 Summit</a> events uniting L2s and other blockchain infrastructure projects within the Ethereum ecosystem. As of writing, zkLink has successfully concluded two L3 Summits, with the inaugural event debuting in November 2023 and the most recent in February 2024. These summits have seen participation from prominent L2 and infrastructure teams like Arbitrum, Celestia, EigenLayer, Kakarot, Linea, Polygon zkEVM, Manta, Mantle, Polygon, QED, Scroll, Starknet, Taiko, and zkSync.</p><h2>Network Activity</h2><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/a7a472fceacacc46805bb33dbbe5743590482ccd-1600x868.jpg?w=800" /><p>On March 14, 2024, zkLink Nova <a href="https://twitter.com/zkLink_Official/status/1768224883207709038">launched</a> the Aggregation Parade, a points campaign to reward users who bridge various tokens to zkLink Nova with NOVA points. Various tokens <a href="https://twitter.com/zkLink_Official/status/1768225412151447754">including</a> ETH, staked ETH tokens, USDC, and USDT are all eligible for NOVA points. The campaign has been a success, and $305.5 million has been bridged to zkLink Nova through March. According to <a href="https://defillama.com/bridged">DefiLlama</a>, zkLink Nova is the largest L3 network by total valued bridged (TVB).</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/dd32a35a2bf5558b6550e4cbd9e09f6857f2428b-1600x863.jpg?w=800" /><p></p><p>Activity has been steadily increasing on zkLink Nova since its mainnet <a href="https://blog.zk.link/zklink-nova-launches-public-mainnet-pioneering-aggregated-layer-3-rollup-networks-419cd254a8a9">launch</a> on March 11, 2024. Daily transactions and daily active addresses both peaked on March 20, 2024, at 23,500 and 11,900, respectively. Throughout March, zkLink Nova averaged 4,800 daily transactions and 1,800 daily active addresses.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/fcb0e2b57e07bb16cb4984c6541cc2facedd4467-1600x868.jpg?w=800" /><p></p><p>Due to the recent launch of zkLink Nova, DeFi TVL is still low. However, as more protocols are deployed, it should continue to increase. There are currently four protocols with notable shares of TVL: <a href="https://symbiosis.finance/">Symbiosis</a>, <a href="https://defillama.com/protocol/native">Native</a>, <a href="https://layerbank.finance/">LayerBank</a>, and <a href="https://izumi.finance/trade/swap">iZiSwap</a>. In total, the four protocols have a combined TVL of $1.4 million. The largest protocol is Symbiosis, with a 46% share of TVL ($652,200). The only lending protocol to date, LayerBank, has a $200,500 TVL, representing 14% of DeFi TVL on zkLink. As more protocols continue to deploy on zkLink, it is expected that an increasing amount of the value bridged to zkLink will be utilized in DeFi.</p><h2>Competitive Landscape</h2><p>Prevalent L2s like Arbitrum, Optimism, Taiko, and zkSync, among others, are building interoperable scaling solutions to address Ethereum's fragmentation challenges. For instance, <a href="https://arbitrum.io/orbit">Arbitrum's Orbit</a> development stack allows developers to deploy customizable and interoperable L2s or L3s known as Orbit Chains. Optimism's <a href="https://docs.optimism.io/stack/explainer">Superchain</a> aims to create a unified network of interoperable OP Chains that share a standardized tooling and development stack (OP Stack). <a href="https://docs.zksync.io/zk-stack/concepts/hyperchains-hyperscaling.html#what-are-hyperchains">zkSync's HyperChain</a> approach connects interoperable but parallel instances of the zkEVM stack with a shared bridge contract and a unified settlement on Ethereum via proof aggregation. Yet, the diversity of their underlying technology stacks limits interoperability between the Arbitrum and Optimism ecosystems. Taiko is building a <a href="https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2022/08/04/zkevm.html#:~:text=Type%201%20(fully,matter%20how%20peripheral.">Type 1 zkEVM</a> for deploying L2s and L3s that can execute Ethereum code seamlessly without any modifications. Despite the potential for enhanced EVM compatibility with Ethereum, developers may need to be sufficiently motivated to switch from established L2 ecosystems like Arbitrum or Optimism to Taiko. </p><p>Conversely, zkLink adopts a universal approach that consolidates all L2s and L1s, regardless of the underlying technology, onto a single platform. zkLink Nova’s L3 streamlines access to liquidity and development across all L2s into a single platform. At the same time, zkLink X allows for the deployment of customizable application-specific rollups with support for L2s and alt-L1s. <a href="https://omni.network/">Omni Network</a> is another project that aims to unite Ethereum L2s. Although, unlike zkLink, Omni Network is an independent L1 that relies on ETH restaking for its security as the first <a href="https://docs.eigenlayer.xyz/eigenlayer/overview/key-terms#:~:text=Actively%20Validated%20Services%20(AVS)%3A%20Any%20system%20that%20requires%20its%20own%20distributed%20validation%20semantics%20for%20verification%2C%20such%20as%20sidechains%2C%20data%20availability%20layers%2C%20new%20virtual%20machines%2C%20keeper%20networks%2C%20oracle%20networks%2C%20bridges%2C%20threshold%20cryptography%20schemes%2C%20and%20trusted%20execution%20environments.">actively validated service</a> (AVS) live on EigenLayer. While zkLink Nova and Omni Network launched in March 2024, analyzing each protocol's approach to aggregating L2s could help determine if an L3 is well-positioned to address Ethereum's fragmentation challenge instead of an independent L1.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/0xMarcB/status/1774551016937324949">Critics</a> have argued that L3s do not necessarily provide much value in scaling Ethereum, citing security risks since most L3s settle on L2s and still need to be interoperable. However, others have argued that L3s scale Ethereum by enabling customizable application development, which may not be possible on L2s. Beyond scaling, L3s like zkLink Nova offer a unified execution environment for developing applications on Ethereum since zkLink Nova ultimately settles on Ethereum and its L2s. As such, users and developers can enjoy an improved user and developer experience without leaving Ethereum for other L1s.</p><p></p><h2><strong>Roadmap</strong></h2><p>zkLink Nova's alpha mainnet <a href="https://zk.link/#:~:text=Nexus%20Playground-,Roadmap,-Completed">launched</a> in March 2024, and substantially new upgrades to the L3 will include support for external DA solutions, a decentralized proof auction market, and the release of new proof systems. Regarding zkLink's centrally managed sequencer service, the team plans to integrate decentralized solutions like Espresso, Astria, and Fairblock in the future to mitigate centralization risks. Another anticipated upgrade is the ZK Oracle, a light node oracle network validating cross-chain states as part of zkLink X’s application-specific engine.</p><p>As of writing, zkLink operates as a Validium, storing transaction data offchain with a Data Availability Committee (DAC) although the ultimate <a href="https://docs.zklink.io/roadmap/keep-evolving">goal</a> is to support external DA solutions like Celestia and EigenDA in the future.</p><h2>Closing Summary</h2><p>As Ethereum's ecosystem grows more complex with the incremental launch of new L2s, solutions like zkLink and its L3 are crucial for streamlining the user and developer experience on the L1. Moreover, the rise of alt-L1s further fragments the blockchain landscape underscoring the need for capital-efficient multichain applications. zkLink aims to address these fragmentation challenges with zkLink Nova, its general-purpose L3, and zkLink X, its customizable application-specific scaling engine. Since <a href="https://explorer.zklink.io/">launching</a> in early March 2024, zkLink Nova has attracted over $300 million in TVL, highlighting an emerging interest in a unified, general-purpose L3 platform. <a href="https://zkex.com/">ZKEX</a> has also been deployed on V2 Alpha Mainnet as the first application-specific DEX built with zkLink X. While other projects race to solve Ethereum’s fragmentation challenges, zkLink's development roadmap focuses on building the leading hub for a unified user and developer experience across Ethereum L2s and alternate L1s.</p></div>

<title>Spoiler Alert – Coinbase Q1 2024 Revenue Estimates</title>
<link>https://messari.io/article/spoiler-alert-coinbase-q1-2024-revenue-estimates</link>
<guid>https://messari.io/article/spoiler-alert-coinbase-q1-2024-revenue-estimates</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。我们估计Coinbase在2024年第一季度的净收入为15亿美元，同比增长65%。投资非交易收入线持续发挥作用，可能占总收入的34%。交易量翻倍意味着交易收入可能增长89%，达到约10亿美元。稳定币收入可能增长12%，而Coinbase的存管收入和基础顺序器收入在未来可能发挥更重要的作用。 <div>
<p>We estimate Coinbase net revenue for Q1 2024 to be $1.5 billion, growing by 65% for the quarter. Our estimate is much higher than the consensus gross revenue estimate of $1.2 billion.

Bitcoin spot ETF approval and fresh all-time-highs meant trading volume doubled in Q1 2024. As volume surged, we expect transaction revenue to follow a similar trajectory and grow by 89% for the quarter to ~$1 billion.

Investments in non-trading revenue lines continue to pay off for Coinbase and may contribute to 34% of revenue. The largest component, stablecoin revenue, may grow by 12% for the quarter, in line with the growth in USDC supply.

We expect blockchain rewards from Coinbase’s staking service to grow by 45% with higher average prices across all supported Proof-of-Stake assets.

Coinbase’s revenue is future-proof, with custody income and Base sequencer revenue likely to play a more significant role going forward.</p>

Launched in 2019, 1inch <a href="https://docs.1inch.io/docs/aggregation-protocol/introduction">Aggregation Protocol (AP)</a> allows users to route trades across various markets and realize the best available rate compared to any individual decentralized exchange (DEX). In late 2020, the 1inch Liquidity Protocol introduced a native automated market maker (AMM) to the network, which enabled users to provide liquidity and earn passive liquidity mining rewards.</p><p>The network’s third product, the 1inch <a href="https://docs.1inch.io/docs/limit-order-protocol/introduction">Limit Order Protocol (LOP)</a>, was introduced in June 2021 to support conditional limit and stop-loss orders with no fees. In late December 2022, the 1inch Swap Engine enabled <a href="https://docs.1inch.io/docs/fusion-swap/introduction">Fusion</a> mode, which is partially based on the existing tech, including the 1inch Limit Order Protocol and the 1inch Aggregation Protocol. This new feature empowers DeFi users to place orders with a specified price and time range without paying network fees. All three protocols, and Fusion mode, are governed by the 1inch DAO using the network’s native 1INCH token.</p><p>Note: This report includes data from Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Gnosis Chain, Fantom, and Base. Data from zkSync, Klaytn, and Aurora are currently not included. We are working to improve access to this data.</p><p><a href="https://1inch.io/">Website</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/1inch">X (Twitter)</a> / <a href="https://t.me/OneInchNetwork">Telegram</a></p><p></p><p></p><h2>Key Metrics</h2><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/8e56c3d14dfcc0511892fee264ccff3db2437105-1824x945.png?w=800" /><p></p><h2>Performance Analysis</h2><h3>Protocol Usage</h3><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/500bb04cde5265d2cbec02647e653b968a0d232e-3840x2160.png?w=800" /><p>As the leading EVM DEX aggregator by volume, 1inch benefits from increased trading activity in the space. Volumes in all three 1inch protocols increased QoQ. The Limit Order Protocol led the way with a 22.5% QoQ rise, rising to an all-time high of $7.9 billion. Fusion volume rose 19.1% to $6 billion, and volumes on the Aggregation Protocol increased 19.6% from the previous quarter to $29 billion. 1inch LOP and Fusion now account for 32% of 1inch volumes, but that volume is driven by fewer daily active addresses. DAUs on the aggregation protocol jumped 55% from Q4’23 to Q1’24, while DAUs on the LOP and Fusion actually fell close to 20% each. During the bull market frenzy, it’s possible that users looking for best execution were less price-sensitive. Rising volumes, however, showed that price-sensitive users traded larger volumes.</p><p>Aggregation Protocol volume growth was broad, with all EVM deployments but Polygon and Arbitrum growing average daily volumes QoQ. Aggregation Protocol volumes on mainnet increased by 25% to roughly $217 million per day. Base and Fantom were the leading percentage gainers, with average daily volumes increasing 210% and 183%, respectively. 1inch on Base traded over $7.7 million per day in Q1’24. Arbitrum and Polygon stand out on the other side of the spectrum, with daily average volume falling 6% and 60%, respectively. Arbitrum is still the second-largest 1inch instance, averaging over $38.7 million in volume per day in Q1.</p><p><br /></p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/5cd92739820036a922aa1dbe9aa3319cddb1dd4a-3840x2160.png?w=800" /><p>Transactions on 1inch increased again in Q1’24. BNB remained the most active instance of 1inch. 1inch on BNB’s transactions increased from just under 25,000 transactions per day in Q4’23 to over 36,000 average daily transactions in Q1’24, a 60% increase QoQ. Transaction activity on Ethereum rose less, up 11% in the quarter, but it moved to the second most active chain as Polygon daily average transactions fell 20% to 14,000 per day. Overall, transaction counts increased on eight out of nine 1inch deployments in Q1’24.</p><p></p><p>The increase in activity was entirely driven by the Aggregation Protocol, as average daily transaction counts on both the Limit Order Protocol and Fusion fell in the first quarter. In Q1’24, 1inch saw over 107,000 daily average transactions in its Aggregation Protocol, up 34% from Q4’23. 1inch also averaged significantly more unique daily addresses transacting than in Q4’23. On average, over 61,000 addresses traded on the Aggregation Protocol across chains in Q1’24, up 55% QoQ.<br /></p><p>LOP transactions fell over 12% in Q1’24, to just under 10,000 per day. The drop was almost entirely attributable to changes on Arbitrum, where transactions fell by almost 1,000 per day, or 43% QoQ. The Arbitrum divergence stands out because Aggregation Protocol usage increased dramatically while Limit Order Protocol usage fell dramatically. This dynamic could be highlighting the nature of users on the chain leaning into faster markets and wanting instant execution instead of potentially unfilled trades.</p><p></p><p></p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/e981c635e66fb76d49db85a597b08ec147f03104-3840x2160.png?w=800" /><p>Fusion volumes grew 19% in the first quarter to $6 billion. Perhaps more notably, Q1’24 was the first quarter in which the 1inch Labs resolver was not the market share leader in terms of volume executed. Resolvers are a key part of Fusion, an intent-based DEX, as they execute the orders placed by users.</p><p>A new competitor, Rizzolver, began competing at the end of September 2023. It grew its market share to 28% in Q1’24, executing over $1.7 billion of Fusion orders. Along with its volume growth, Rizzolver has offered the highest APY to delegates. Competition from other resolvers also evened the market, with the top three resolvers execution share falling from 88% in Q3 to 83% in Q4 and down to 74% in Q1’24. The increased competition is great for traders, and it might even be early signs of success of the new rules implemented by the DAO last quarter around lower delegation minimums and putting a cap on gas bidding.</p><p><br /></p><h3>Market Share Analysis</h3><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/052d513d1a945cb0a6e1b97db11eddc0265a5ef7-3840x2160.png?w=800" /><p>In the first quarter, the share of 1inch trades executed on Uniswap V3 and V2 increased to over $12.8 billion or 47% of 1inch Aggregation Protocol volume. The mix changed slightly, with V3 volumes rising 34% to over $11 billion and V2 volumes falling 6.5% to $1.6 billion. On the back of the increased activity on BNB, PancakeSwap was the largest percent gainer in the quarter with volume increasing 74% to $2.6 billion. In general, the winners continued to gain market share. The top five protocols executed 77% of 1inch volume in Q1’24, up from 72% in the fourth quarter of 2023.</p><p><br /></p><p></p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/0beff910683479d6f446c46ca16b2aaa9c62d45a-3840x2160.png?w=800" /><p>1inch continued to lead DEX aggregators after carrying 61% market share of 2023 volume. However, first-quarter market share of volume was lower than any quarter last year, falling to 51%. 1inch’s main peers all grew significantly faster, QoQ. The four largest competitors grew volumes over 70%, despite starting from a significantly lower base. Combined, the top four aggregators accounted for 86% of volumes.</p><p><br /><br /></p><h3>Treasury and Staking</h3><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/5289d7407cc6215542c464c919c9ac46fbf98033-3840x2160.png?w=800" /><p>The DAO continues to be mindful of spending while still allocating to growth opportunities for all 1inch users and participants. In Q1’24, the largest payment was the<a href="https://snapshot.org/#/1inch.eth/proposal/0xa455f437479cad77a20096c1717f2b23777f258060dd6a0d5882a9aebfaf8275"> $1.6 million grant for events</a> to continue promoting 1inch at crypto events. The two other large payments in the quarter were a <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/1inch.eth/proposal/0x9853ef2799f65981935d96f3dbdb30756b0cee7c2a6b55ef781af6a450bbdda6">$50,000 retainer fee for legal services</a> and a <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/1inch.eth/proposal/0x496412df4ba3db40d0c80278b463badd34a047d3d81e6490e8a7a37fe87385bb">$73,000 payment for a team to build an alternate, open-sourced front-end for swapping</a>. Otherwise, treasury allocations did not change, and the DAO continues to benefit from interest earned from the $1 million in sDAI and $1 million in aETHUSDC.</p><p></p><p></p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/ed8017639831238e380f0339d3300e35497ddf8a-3840x2160.png?w=800" /><p>After peaking at just under 210 million 1INCH staked in December of last year, the amount of 1INCH staked fell by 3% in the first quarter of 2024. Staking 1INCH gives Unicorn Power (UP), which can be used to vote in governance and delegate to resolvers. Staking and delegating to resolvers create an important value accrual pathway for the token: resolvers give 1INCH rewards to attract delegates so the resolvers can compete in completing Fusion transactions. Some upcoming resolvers like <a href="https://app.1inch.io/#/1/dao/delegate/0xee230dd7519bc5d0c9899e8704ffdc80560e8509">Kinetex Labs</a> and <a href="https://app.1inch.io/#/1/dao/delegate/0xb2153caa185484fd377f488d89143a7fd76695ce">Laertes</a> have paid out over 57,000 1INCH to delegates to help grow their delegation.</p><h2>Qualitative Analysis</h2><h3>Retainer for Legal Services</h3><p>The proposed <a href="https://gov.1inch.io/discussion/14065-1ip49-legal-regulatory-compliance-services-to-defend-the-rights-and-interests-of-1inch-dao">services for 1inch DAO by STORM Partners</a> aim to provide comprehensive legal support tailored to the decentralized and blockchain-based ecosystem. Some operational challenges include navigating cross-jurisdictional regulatory compliance, establishing contractual agreements, formulating a governance framework, addressing members' liability, and protecting intellectual property, among others. The history of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) is fraught with legal uncertainties due to their novel operational structures that defy traditional legal classifications. As a result, some protocols have turned to specialized legal services that can adeptly navigate the evolving regulatory landscape and safeguard the interests of these innovative entities.</p><p>The importance of these services for 1inch DAO cannot be overstated. In the rapidly evolving world of blockchain and decentralized finance (DeFi), DAOs like 1inch face multifaceted legal risks, including regulatory compliance issues, potential member liabilities, and the enforcement of rights and contracts. The services provided by STORM Partners are designed to mitigate these risks, ensuring that 1inch DAO can maintain operational resilience, protect its stakeholders' interests, and continue its mission to disrupt traditional financial systems. This proactive approach to legal challenges is crucial for the longevity and success of DAOs in a landscape with developing legal precedents.</p><p>1inch DAO’s engagement with STORM Partners signals a broader recognition of the need for robust legal frameworks and professional guidance in DAOs and the wider blockchain community. This move also reflects a maturation of the sector. While acknowledging that decentralization offers new opportunities for autonomy and efficiency, 1inch has acted upon the need for a sophisticated understanding of legal and regulatory obligations. This trend towards seeking legal advisory services may set a precedent for other DAOs, indicating a shift towards more structured governance and operational models. This evolution is essential for the broader acceptance and integration of DAOs into the existing socioeconomic fabric, ensuring their sustainability and growth in the long term.</p><p><br /></p><h3>Key Integrations</h3><p>The 1inch protocol has made significant strides in expanding its ecosystem and enhancing its utility through a series of strategic integrations. Starting on January 26, the <a href="https://x.com/1inchWallet/status/1750891232673341581?s=20">1inch Wallet for Android announced an integration with Stripe</a>. The move introduced a fiat onramp that significantly eases the process for users to convert their fiat currency into crypto directly within the wallet. In addition, the integration broadens access to DeFi services for a wider audience and for builders to use one of the fastest-growing existing payment providers.</p><p>Following this, a series of integrations with various DeFi platforms were announced, including <a href="https://x.com/Velvet_Capital/status/1752473816876409054?s=20">Velvet on January 30</a>, <a href="https://x.com/THORWalletDEX/status/1752409169402212490?s=20">THORWallet on the same day</a>, <a href="https://x.com/THORWalletDEX/status/1752409169402212490?s=20">Kinetex on February 8</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/AspisProtocol/status/1757040090981785863?s=20">Apsis on February 12</a>. Each of these partnerships brings unique value to the 1inch ecosystem. For instance, Velvet's integration allows for optimized asset management services; THORWallet enhances the wallet's functionality; Kinetex introduces advanced trading capabilities; and Apsis incorporates the 1inch Swap API for improved swap functionalities. These integrations collectively enhance the 1inch protocol's utility, making it a more versatile and powerful tool for users across the DeFi landscape.</p><p>The <a href="https://twitter.com/1inchWallet/status/1750891232673341581?s=20">integration with Lido</a> on February 21 marks a significant milestone, providing <a href="https://help.lido.fi/en/articles/7913058-swap-to-eth-using-1inch">liquidity solutions for users looking to convert stETH/wstETH to ETH</a>. This collaboration addresses a critical need within the DeFi community and offers a seamless solution for liquidity. Ultimately, it will help enhance the overall efficiency of the Ethereum staking ecosystem. These developments signal a broader trend towards more sophisticated and interconnected DeFi services. With these steps, 1inch has not only expanded its reach but also played a pivotal role in shaping the future of decentralized finance.</p><p><br /></p><h2>Closing Summary</h2><p>1inch usage grew across the board in the first quarter of 2024 with total volumes rising to $43 billion. Unlike Q4, where only volumes showed life, Q1 saw DAUs and the number of transactions jump meaningfully in the 1inch Aggregation Protocol. Larger trades drove the increased volume in the Limit Order Protocol and Fusion. However, 1inch’s peers grew faster in the quarter, bringing 1inch down to 51% DEX aggregator volume market share. The treasury is steady in value, spending under $2 million in the quarter with no new asset allocation decisions. As the DAO and product continue to grow and mature, they have brought on legal services through STORM Partners and attracted large integrations with the likes of Lido and Stripe. Time and again, 1inch has capitalized on the surge in onchain activity.</p></div>

<title>Synthetix Q1 2024 Brief</title>
<link>https://messari.io/article/synthetix-q1-2024-brief</link>
<guid>https://messari.io/article/synthetix-q1-2024-brief</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。Synthetix在2024年第一季度取得了良好的成绩。Perps V3在Base上快速增长，尽管仅有有限的开放利益（OI）上限，季度交易量超过3.25亿美元。DAO还通过了SIP，以在Arbitrum上推出V3，资助在Sui和Solana网络上推出产品的研发，并在Base上列出了新的underlier。尽管季度DAUs下降至565人，但Perps交易量连续第四个季度超过110亿美元。第一个没有SNX通货膨胀的全季度对网络抵押比率几乎没有影响，抵押人通过交易费平均获得了4.3%的年利率。另外，抵押人数量略有增长，接近4.6万人。Synthetix在2024年迎来了V3的发展，并在多个网络上取得成功，为未来的增长打下了基础。 <div>
<div><h2><strong>Key Insights</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>Synthetix Perps V3 on Base is growing quickly with over $325 million in volume in the quarter despite limited open interest (OI) caps</strong>.</li><li>The DAO also approved a SIP to <strong>launch V3 on Arbitrum</strong>, <strong>treasury proposals to fund R&amp;D</strong> for launching on Sui and Solana networks, and <strong>listed new underliers on Base</strong> beyond ETH and BTC currently.</li><li><strong>Perps volume fell in the quarter but remained over $11 billion for the fourth consecutive quarter</strong>. DAUs also fell QoQ to 565.</li><li><strong>The first full quarter of no SNX inflation saw little-to-no impact on the network staking ratio, and stakers earned an average 4.3% APY from trading fees</strong>. The number of stakers grew slightly to nearly 46,000.</li></ul><p><br /></p><h2>Primer</h2><p>Synthetix (<a href="https://messari.io/project/synthetix">SNX</a>) is a decentralized synthetic asset issuance and liquidity protocol that enables users to trade synthetic cryptocurrencies. Each synthetic asset tracks the price of an external asset through the use of Chainlink, Pyth, or Uniswap V3 TWAP oracles. Users can either trade in spot or in perpetual futures markets for synthetic assets. SNX is the native protocol token, used for governance and as the primary collateral asset that backs the liquidity of the network. SNX can be staked as collateral for sUSD, the Synthetix stablecoin, which can be traded on Synthetix for any other synth (sAsset). Synthetix V2x is live on Ethereum and Optimism, and V3 launched on Base in Q4 2023. Synthetix Perps is the protocol’s leading product. The DAO uses a novel V3 Governance Module (V3GM), which has councils of representatives voted on by SNX holders.</p><p><a href="https://synthetix.io/">Website</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/synthetix_io">X (Twitter)</a> / <a href="https://discord.com/invite/AEdUHzt">Discord</a></p><h2>Key Metrics</h2><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/7db05686751e6029ed32dcaab57bea489fbf7584-1824x929.png?w=800" /><p></p><h2>Performance Analysis</h2><h3>Perps Volume and DAUs</h3><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/f30cf608227b9304bf21892d0b44d4b2570c0fef-3840x2160.png?w=800" /><p>Strong trading volumes on Synthetix continued in the first quarter of 2024 with over $11 billion in volume for the fourth consecutive quarter. Volume on V3 was over $325 million in its first full quarter. Meanwhile, the open interest (OI) caps on BTC and ETH slowly increased (OI caps were $1 million for January and most of February, then increased to $10 million in mid-February with <a href="https://sips.synthetix.io/sccp/sccp-312/">a proposal pending to increase to $20 million</a>). Q2 will likely see a larger rollout of V3 on Base, with <a href="https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-363/">SNX, SOL, and WIF perps recently approved</a> and likely more coming.</p><p><br /></p><h3>Fees to Stakers</h3><p></p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/3b755e6fb08763cea64e78531d1fa85b94109dca-3840x2160.png?w=800" /><p>In the first quarter without SNX inflation incentives, SNX stakers earned over $9 million in fees in Q1’24, down slightly from the $10 million in the previous quarter. The Synthetix Optimism deployment continues to generate nearly all of the fees for stakers. Trading fees on Optimism and mainnet are not paid as a dividend but rather by burning sUSD, which reduces debt for stakers. Synthetix Perps V3 on Base instead <a href="https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-345/?ref=blog.synthetix.io">takes a portion of fees (40%)</a> and allocates them to buying back and burning <a href="https://blog.synthetix.io/the-snx-base-bridge/">bridged SNX</a>. In Q1’24, Perps V3 on Base generated over $130,000 in total fees paid and led to over <a href="https://dune.com/synthetix_community/synthetix-v3">9,300 SNX burned</a>. The rest of the trading fees are split between LPs (40%) and integrators (20%).</p><p><br /></p><h3>OI and Staker PNL</h3><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/ceaf1f4e127995e0c5ea0f2c837dbbcbbf922a54-3840x2160.png?w=800" /><p>Following a wildly successful first year of Synthetix Perps V2, stakers continued to earn positive PNL in Q1’24. V2’s key feature empowers market makers to collect the spread created by takers buying or selling against LP collateral (staked SNX). This design keeps LP exposure near zero (<a href="https://x.com/kaiynne/status/1741632965766246681?s=20">though certainly not risk-free</a>). Instead of collecting spread, LPs collect fees on increased volumes (the initial trade and the market maker) and have significantly reduced exposure to trader’s directional preference.</p><p></p><p>Open interest (OI) also measures the risk being taken and the demand for Synthetix Perps. After peaking at over $200 million in December 2023, OI fell in the beginning of 2024 but later increased along with trading activity. The quarter ended with $154 million in open interest on Synthetix. OI on Synthetix is a bit different than on order-book DEXs, but it probably gives a better read-through on demand for perps. Synthetix V2 continues to attract demand, and in the last quarter, it did so without any added incentives to traders.</p><p><br /></p><h3>Synthetix V3 is Growing</h3><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/03791ec2efe51c18c8f3b17e8e05715cf9555b16-3840x2160.png?w=800" /><p>Synthetix <a href="https://blog.synthetix.io/what-is-the-andromeda-release/">Andromeda</a> brought Perps V3 to Base in 2023. <a href="https://sips.synthetix.io/sccp/sccp-310/">OI caps increased from $10,000 to $1 million in January</a>, then to <a href="https://sips.synthetix.io/sccp/sccp-311/">$10 million in the second half of February</a>. <a href="https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-363/">SIP-363</a> was also passed, allowing the listings of SNX, SOL, and WIF perps on V3. As activity on Base picks up, Synthetix V3 will be well-positioned in the new economy. To help further grow adoption, the DAO approved <a href="https://sips.synthetix.io/sccp/sccp-313/">USDC</a> and <a href="https://sips.synthetix.io/sccp/sccp-314/">SNX incentives on Base</a>. V3 has different tokenomics than Perps V2, with USDC staking as collateral (instead of SNX) and a fee split that sends 50% of fees to the burner address that can buy and burn SNX.</p><p></p><p></p><h2>Key Developments</h2><h3>V3 Updates</h3><ul><li>January 8, 2024: Increase the ETH and BTC OI and LP limit on Base from $10,000 to $1 million <a href="https://sips.synthetix.io/sccp/sccp-309/">SCCP-309</a>, <a href="https://sips.synthetix.io/sccp/sccp-310/">SCCP-310</a>.</li><li>January 10, 2024: Launched the <a href="https://blog.synthetix.io/the-snx-base-bridge/">SNX bridge to Base </a>and added liquidity to Aerodrome.

The first stage includes expanding to Base and Arbitrum, and V3 has already facilitated over $325 million in volume on Base, even with restrictive OI caps. Caps are being raised and new underliers are being added, while the DAO allocates treasury assets to incentivize more liquidity.

<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章指出了比特币（BTC）价格的快速增长，BTC的新用途和功能，挖矿和安全领域的发展，以及比特币层的创新和发展。重点在于BTC价格的增长，BTC ETF的成功推动了价格行动，挖矿收入的增加以及比特币层的建设和发展。整体上显示了比特币生态系统的蓬勃发展和创新活动。 <div>
<div><h2>Key Insights</h2><ul><li><strong>BTC’s price increased 69% QoQ to $71,310, setting a new all-time high </strong>as it approached the new halving cycle in April.</li><li><strong>The success of the spot BTC ETFs was a driving factor in price action, with over $12 billion in inflows in Q1.</strong> Spot BTC ETFs now hold 831,000 BTC or $59 billion.</li><li><strong>Inscription transactions and fees were down 40% and 60% QoQ.</strong> However, sales volumes on NFT exchanges remained over $10 million per day. The halving in April will bring with it the launch of the Runes token protocol and an Epic sat.</li><li><strong>Miner revenue (USD) was up 34% QoQ, and miners are exploring inscriptions and MEV as additional revenue sources. </strong>Several miners haveformalized block-selling to meet Ordinals builders’ demand.</li><li><strong>TVL on programmable Bitcoin layers increased 127% QoQ. </strong>Dozens of new layers are being built to scale and to add programmability to Bitcoin, with many of them exploring BitVM-based bridging and state validation.</li></ul><h2>Primer</h2><p>Bitcoin (<a href="https://messari.io/project/bitcoin">BTC</a>) is the first distributed consensus-based, peer-to-peer payment settlement network. Bitcoin (BTC), the native asset of the Bitcoin blockchain, was the world's first digital currency without a central bank or administrator. Often referred to as digital gold, bitcoin has a predictable, stable monetary policy that operates autonomously, giving it the ideal store-of-value properties.</p><p>To secure its network, Bitcoin uses a Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus mechanism to solve the “double-spend problem.” PoW requires participants (miners) to contribute computing power to solve arbitrary mathematical puzzles in order to add a new block to the blockchain. Bitcoin is awarded to the miner who solves the puzzle first, thus minting new bitcoins.</p><p>Bitcoin has historically been focused on enabling peer-to-peer payments and being a store of value, but not as much on DeFi, NFTs, and other narratives enabled by programmability (i.e., expressive smart contracts and arbitrary computation). Instead, those narratives were deferred to alternative networks. However, Bitcoin is now experiencing a renaissance of programmability, largely thanks to two recent innovations, <a href="https://rodarmor.com/blog/ordinal-theory/">Ordinal Theory</a> and <a href="https://bitvm.org/">BitVM</a>. Both innovations leverage offchain indexing or computation, and neither makes any changes to the core protocol. Ordinal Theory emphasized the demand for added functionality, and then BitVM made expressive and trust-minimized L2s seem possible. These innovations have sparked a frenzy of experimentation with onchain assets and modular layers.</p><p><a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">Whitepaper</a> / <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/">Reddit</a> / <a href="https://github.com/bitcoin-core">GitHub</a></p><h2>Key Metrics</h2><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/e19f17b4f52cb37075e1781bcc26e2eb8e42564e-3200x1966.jpg?w=800" /><h2>Financial Analysis</h2><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/c3733586519fa08b398aa34907730170bb88b4cd-3200x1770.jpg?w=800" /><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/91fc67fd6a65893795b99e1fd938391fdbe7d899-1280x720.png?w=800" /><p>BTC’s price was up 68.78% QoQ, ending Q1 at $71,310 and setting a new all-time high. This price increase drove BTC’s market cap dominance up to 49.7% in March 2024. This market cap dominance increase is typical of the start of a new halving cycle, as BTC often leads the action in other cryptocurrencies. Several factors contributed to this price increase and all-time high, including anticipation for the supply halving in April 2024.</p><p>However, the spot BTC ETFs launched in January were perhaps the largest catalyst, as they collectively had $12.04 billion (212,000 BTC) in inflows during Q1. The ETFs are explored further in the Institutional Analysis section.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/22031da611dcb07b741e6ddd5b69baf269cc0e09-1280x720.png?w=800" /><p>In Q4 2023, inscription activities drove fees up 699.4% QoQ to $502 million. This inscription-mania again proved to be inconsistent after this Q1 decline of 41.9% to $291 million. Despite the decrease in overall fees, inscription-related transactions still generated 18.4% of overall transaction fees, down from 25.8% in Q4 2023.</p><p>Bitcoin pays ~$63 million per day for security (900 BTC per day at a price of $70,000). Fees averaged $3.2 million throughout Q1, covering 5% of Bitcoin’s security budget. For context, in December 2023, fees covered roughly 50% of the security budget. 2023 was the <a href="https://twitter.com/0xKofi/status/1739615408007553350">first year in Bitcoin's history</a> where the annual security budget (relative to market cap) was greater than the year prior (from 1.8% to 1.9%), pointing at potential economic sustainability.</p><p>Inscriptions alone are currently too inconsistent to reliably cover Bitcoin’s security budget. <a href="https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1733683688762687507">However</a>, the usage of Bitcoin’s arbitrary blockspace is being further explored by additional protocols. Their innovations could become constant demand drivers and revenue generators, as detailed in the Layers Analysis section below. Fees resulting from this demand will increasingly become more relevant in Bitcoin’s overall revenue, especially as BTC issuance (and hence, the security budget) will halve from 6.25 per block to 3.125 in April 2024. After the halving, the current volume of fees would cover as little as 2.5% of the security budget, rather than 5%.</p><h2>Network Analysis</h2><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/31082ef0e1c1b03bdade0b6c869906c19ca75139-3200x1810.jpg?w=800" /><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/8ca28cc3a7284d54775a257cd7c50b0181c504f6-1280x720.png?w=800" /><p>Average daily transactions and daily active addresses decreased 15.3% and 4.7% QoQ, respectively. The ratio of transactions to active addresses decreased for the first time in seven quarters, nearly two years. The changes suggest that the transaction decline may have come from decreased activity from bots or “super users” (users that transact often and account for a large portion of the activity). Regardless of the user makeup, this behavior shift coincides with the decline in inscription-related activities and fees.</p><p>Inscription-related activity on the network first took off in February 2023, leading to a 44% QoQ increase in transactions from Q1 2023 to Q2 2023. While Q1 2024’s activity was down QoQ, it was still up 36% YoY from the beginning of the inscription craze.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/40110d9e85aa2c096ca31883de395835c9950b59-1600x1027.png?w=800" /><p>The average block size and number of transactions stayed generally flat throughout 2022 and into 2023, up until Ordinals first gained attention in February 2023. Overall, the average block size stabilized following the increase in early 2023. In addition, transaction activity didn’t see any significant increases until the end of Q2 2023. As such, the increase in average block size likely came from the type of transactions (i.e., inscriptions) rather than the volume of transactions themselves. The effects of inscriptions can be seen in other network metrics as well, such as Bitcoin’s <a href="https://twitter.com/_Checkmatey_/status/1704747147617567026">packed</a> mempool.</p><p>Ordinals builders and Bitcoin miners have been approaching the maximum size of the 4 MB blocks <a href="https://blog.bitmex.com/the-segwit-transaction-capacity-increase-part-1/">enabled</a> by Segwit. First, Luxor <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/207986/luxor-mines-largest-bitcoin-block-ever-contains-taproot-wizard-nft">mined</a> a <a href="https://mempool.space/block/0000000000000000000515e202c8ae73c8155fc472422d7593af87aa74f2cf3d">block</a> at 3.96 MB on February 1, 2023. More recently, on March 2, 2024, Marathon <a href="https://twitter.com/mononautical/status/1764005321578586131">mined</a> a <a href="https://mempool.space/block/00000000000000000000e37d10aa5a5ece8dba4a20f011280ae3d1880414ff7e">block</a> at 3.99 MB. Following that, F2Pool <a href="https://twitter.com/ord_io/status/1774106548580569117">mined</a> a <a href="https://mempool.space/block/000000000000000000016778f9dc7aca7bdb099f4bea90084ecfd1baecff82ec">block</a> at 3.97 MB on March 30, 2024.</p><h3>Mining and Security</h3><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/2585da3a99ca895169159d9849c308b13ce53ada-1280x720.png?w=800" /><p>In total, 7.6% of miner revenue came from fees in 2023, compared to 1.6% in 2022. So far in 2024, 6.5% of miner revenue has come from fees. While this is a slight decrease from 2023, it is a significant QoQ decrease compared to Q4 2023, when 11.6% of miner revenue came from fees. The larger the portion of revenue coming from fees rather than issuance, the more economically sustainable the network is, as issuance will continue to decline until reaching zero.</p><p>At block 740,000, which will occur in April 2024, the block reward will halve from 6.25 BTC to 3.125 BTC. Because revenue comes almost entirely from this block reward, miner revenue denominated in BTC will be nearly cut in half in Q2 2024. The revenue change denominated in USD is harder to estimate due to BTC’s price action.</p><h4>MEV</h4><p>An alternative revenue channel for miners, which has recently grown, is maximal extractable value (MEV, also called miner extractable value). MEV is more prominent on fully expressive networks, such as Ethereum. There, more sophisticated block builders can reorder transactions from decentralized exchanges and other applications to create a profit (e.g., sandwich attacks). However, the recent introduction of alternative tokens from meta-protocols such as Ordinals has created MEV opportunities for Bitcoin miners. As these MEV opportunities are relatively new, the ecosystem lacks clear <a href="https://explore.flashbots.net/data-metrics#intro">heuristics</a> for measuring MEV.</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/cbspears/status/1765068975216673254">NFTs</a> have created consistent MEV opportunities, where miners can arbitrage prices between marketplaces or simply front-run others attempting the same thing. Many of these MEV activities, particularly <a href="https://portal.vc/bitcoin">PSBT</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/mononautical/status/1737472877706739765">mempool sniping</a>, can also be executed by standard users, although a sophisticated block builder can easily front-run such user activities.</p><p>MEV is contentious on Bitcoin, as increased MEV opportunities — such as those created by Drivechains — could lead the already-competitive mining business to adopt MEV strategies. This could price out smaller miners that can’t allocate resources to MEV strategies, ultimately leading to increased centralization. This concern is not relevant for other models of layers, such as rollup concepts, where MEV is isolated to the layer’s sequencers. As on Ethereum, this L2 sequencer MEV typically does not trickle down to L1 validators.</p><h4>Hashrate</h4><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/0d928d6e602cdd65ee4a551fbb17154859303f7a-1280x720.png?w=800" /><p>The economic effects of the Q2 2024 issuance halving will be especially relevant in the context of hashrate. As hashrate grows, miner <a href="https://en.macromicro.me/charts/29435/bitcoin-production-total-cost">profitability</a> decreases (assuming a constant BTC price). Hashrate represents the security of the Bitcoin network. It increased 19.0% QoQ in Q1.</p><p>As Bitcoin programmability gains more interest and the ecosystem grows, hashrate has become increasingly commoditized. Marathon, a large mining company, launched <a href="https://ir.mara.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1343/marathon-digital-holdings-launches-slipstream">Slipstream</a> to allow customers to rent Marathon’s hash power and create their own blocks. It can also be described as private-mempool-as-a-service and has <a href="https://twitter.com/CK_Cryptoklepto/status/1775704154771423419">proven</a> to be <a href="https://mempool.space/graphs/mining/pools#3m">profitable</a>. Other miners are also exploring this service, including <a href="https://financialpost.com/globe-newswire/dmg-announces-expanding-business-for-large-ordinal-inscriptions-petra-patent-grant">Terra Pool</a>. There are also decentralized hashrate marketplaces popping up, such as the <a href="https://medium.com/lumerin-blog/lumerin-unveils-web-portal-for-decentralized-bitcoin-hashpower-marketplace-ccade0a8cf4f">Lumerin DEX</a> on Arbitrum. This strategy of accepting fees for non-standard block building, also known as <a href="https://blog.bitmex.com/miner-fee-gathering-capability-part-2-out-of-band-fees">out-of-band</a> fees, is not new to mining, there are just new incentives for it</p><p>The demand for such a service has grown with increased usage of inscriptions and meta-protocols based on inscriptions, such as Ordinals. Users have been circumventing Bitcoin Core’s standardness rules by using a hashrate provider (miner) directly to create blocks. For example, a single 3.9 MB transaction would violate the standardness rules of Bitcoin Core (the primary client software for running Bitcoin nodes) and not be picked up through the mempool, but would be perfectly acceptable according to the consensus rules of the Bitcoin network itself.</p><h3>Censorship</h3><p>A side effect of inscriptions is UTXO state bloat, which can indirectly lead to concerns over decentralization, and in extreme cases, censorship as a response. The <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/utxo-count">number of UTXOs</a> on Bitcoin has increased 102% since the beginning of 2023 to over 170 million. Part of the growth comes from BRC-20s creating a new UTXO with each transfer, which contributes to growing unprunable UTXO sets. Because this state bloat requires more physical resources from full nodes, it could ultimately affect decentralization (i.e., the ability of the average user to operate a node).</p><p>Due to the state bloat effect on the network and the general introduction of new asset types, some members of the Bitcoin community see inscriptions as <a href="https://twitter.com/LukeDashjr/status/1732204937466032285">spam</a> and an <a href="https://habla.news/jb55/1701876273423">attack</a> on Bitcoin. Not all Bitcoin spam (i.e., fun) is built the <a href="https://twitter.com/mononautical/status/1732224537230741562">same</a>, but it is similarly rejected by certain users. The <a href="https://ocean.xyz/">OCEAN</a> mining pool <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/jack-dorsey-leads-seed-round-in-support-of-oceans-mission-to-decentralize-bitcoin-mining-globally---announces-launch-at-future-of-bitcoin-mining-conference-301999073.html?tc=eml_cleartime">raised</a> money in Q4 2023 and announced it would be filtering/censoring inscription transactions, which it sees as an attack on the network. However, other transaction types, such as <a href="https://twitter.com/SamouraiWallet/status/1732584009442443336">coinjoins</a>, also fit their <a href="https://twitter.com/LukeDashjr/status/1732597621015949494">criteria</a> and are <a href="https://twitter.com/sethforprivacy/status/1732764613396025844">excluded</a> by the pool.</p><p>The OCEAN pool has only created a couple of blocks, but it represents how divided the community is on inscriptions. The Monero community had already successfully <a href="https://monero.observer/monero-to-block-nfts-upcoming-release/">implemented</a> a <a href="https://github.com/monero-project/monero/pull/8733">patch</a> back in Q2 to reduce the amount of space available and effectively disable the minting of NFTs on its own network. <a href="https://twitter.com/0xCygaar/status/1736581628259107314">Other networks</a> faced their own “issues” with BRC-20-inspired tokens. <a href="https://twitter.com/smyyguy/status/1726716454354182290">Avalanche</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/artemis__xyz/status/1730587681141424283">NEAR</a>, Solana, and <a href="https://twitter.com/jakegallen_/status/1731806232548454615">others</a> have experienced major activity spikes, and Toncoin and Arbitrum even had <a href="https://twitter.com/moo9000/status/1732751363249934640">outages</a>. BRC-20s on Bitcoin can be filtered out, <a href="https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1723213766689456464">front-run</a>, or forked away, but the majority of the Bitcoin community appears to be interested in keeping the asset class around. This sentiment is evidenced by network activity metrics, community sentiment, and miner fees accepted.</p><p><a href="https://blog.bitmex.com/protecting-bitcoin-censorship-resistance/">Historically</a>, Bitcoin has <a href="https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1732620663267963124">seen</a> many versions of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.18545.pdf">censorship</a> apart from <a href="https://blog.bitmex.com/dapps-or-only-bitcoin-transactions-the-2014-debate/">OP_Return debates</a>. Major mining pools have been found to comply with OFAC sanctions many times. However, there is an important <a href="https://twitter.com/robustus/status/1739827413364678799">difference</a> between a miner not including certain transactions in their own block and a miner refusing to build on another miner’s block that included the “banned” transactions. The latter could ultimately break consensus stability. In Q4, OFAC-censored transactions have been <a href="https://b10c.me/observations/08-missing-sanctioned-transactions/?t">missing</a> or had the blocks containing them <a href="https://twitter.com/resistancemoney/status/1739813340044795956">orphaned</a> by some of the largest miners, which poses a more serious concern for Bitcoin’s neutrality.</p><h2>Token Analysis</h2><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/72c76fa49d1ebec83fdeed04d725fddb5841bc62-3200x1770.jpg?w=800" /><p>Bitcoin saw new innovation in 2023 through <a href="https://messari.io/report/inscriptions-a-bitcoin-renaissance">inscriptions</a>, leveraging the SegWit and Taproot upgrades. <a href="https://rodarmor.com/blog/ordinal-theory/">Ordinal Theory</a>, created in late 2022, birthed the first inscription-based meta-protocol, <a href="https://docs.ordinals.com/overview.html">Ordinals</a>. Ordinals exploded in popularity and revealed a <a href="https://messari.io/report/sector-brief-extra-ordinary">serious appetite</a> for NFTs, memecoins, and overall added functionality in the Bitcoin ecosystem.</p><p>Ordinals index individual <a href="https://river.com/learn/terms/s/satoshi/">satoshis</a> (sats) as well as any arbitrary data (images, text, etc.) inscribed on them, effectively creating entirely onchain NFTs. Alternative BTC-derivative asset types, either based on Ordinals or inspired by them, came shortly after. <a href="https://twitter.com/domodata/status/1633658974686855168">BRC-20s</a> are ‘fungible’ Ordinals. Due to the inherent nonfungible nature of sats (when indexed) and the account-based accounting model used to index them, they’re more accurately non-fungible, like fractionalized shares of an NFT.</p><h3>BRC-20s</h3><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/2bb504348858a3b8845c24cf043762857a68641d-1280x720.png?w=800" /><p>Average daily inscription transactions decreased 40.4% QoQ. However, daily inscriptions were still up 1,464.3% YoY. Even though alternative asset types and token standards, such as <a href="https://twitter.com/hirowallet/status/1654122354661027840">Stamps</a>, do contribute to the activity, BRC-20s have been the primary driver of overall inscription activity. Their dominance declined in Q1 for the second quarter in a row, as BRC-20 transactions decreased 51.1% QoQ and other inscription transactions increased 14.2% QoQ.</p><p>As of the end of Q1, <a href="https://messari.io/project/ordinals">ORDI</a> was the largest BRC-20 token by market cap, ranking 93rd among all networks (down from being in the top 50 in Q4 2023). Several marketplaces exist for Ordinals (both BRC-20s and NFTs) such as MagicEden, Unisat, and ALEX’s B20 DEX — with many more in development.</p><p>The urgency surrounding BRC-20 token launches has created high-fee environments as users seek to outbid each other. Certain inscription types, such as images, are disproportionately expensive (relative to text). However, due to their higher volume and mint behavior, BRC-20s are still the inscription type that contributes most to total inscription fees.</p><h3>NFTs</h3><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/f309c5ae53fc98a1d73b3b85ea3ab1a0f189b95b-1280x720.png?w=800" /><p>In terms of daily transaction volume, Bitcoin NFT exchanges are already competing with, and even exceeding, the established NFT ecosystems on Ethereum and Solana. Bitcoin has yet to challenge these other networks in other NFT metrics, such as daily transactions (8,000 on Bitcoin versus 25,000 on Ethereum and 117,000 on Solana in Q1) or unique buyers/sellers (5,000 on Bitcoin versus 9,000 on Ethereum and 17,000 on Solana in Q1).</p><p>As BRC-20s are also Ordinals, they’re sold on some NFT marketplaces and included in some NFT metrics. However, BRC-20s are treated by many users as fungible and therefore may be more accurately compared to DEX volumes. Bitcoin’s NFT sales volume wouldn’t even crack the top 10 among all networks’ <a href="https://defillama.com/dexs/chains">DEX volumes</a> so far in 2024.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/304bf637b3bcd9fe9f8fdf80cf2009444e2913c1-1280x720.png?w=800" /><p>In Q1’24, <a href="https://magiceden.io/">Magic Eden</a> emerged as the dominant Bitcoin marketplace in terms of both sales volume and transactions. Magic Eden’s sales volume and transactions increased 641% and 221% QoQ, respectively. The top NFT collections by market cap are <a href="https://nodemonkes.com/monkedex">NodeMonkes</a> and <a href="https://magiceden.io/ordinals/marketplace/bitcoin-puppets">Bitcoin Puppets</a>, at 4,700 BTC and 2,400 BTC, respectively. Both are profile picture (PFP) projects, although the latter has an accompanying BRC-20, <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/pups-ordinals">PUPS</a>.</p><p>Other collections also launched with specific goals. The <a href="http://quantumcats.xyz">Quantum Cats</a> project was launched by <a href="https://taprootwizards.com/">Taproot Wizards</a> with the express purpose of funding and organizing a Bitcoin soft fork. The project aims to drive discussion and adoption around an opcode (i.e., an instruction in Bitcoin Script) for concatenating other instructions, op_cat, and then ultimately integrating it. This approach is a unique medium for coordination around a technical upgrade and circumvents parts of the <a href="https://www.quantumcats.xyz/bip-land">traditional</a> <a href="https://utxos.org/signals/">path</a> of a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP).</p><p>Some Ordinals builders have innovated with inscriptions. The limitations in Bitcoin programmability have driven creativity among builders, rather than stifle it. Endpoints and attributes cannot be changed on Ordinals, but they can be made dynamic through commitments and “recursion.” Commitments involve including a symmetrically encrypted attribute later revealed onchain, similar to posting commitments for <a href="https://www.redvelvet.tech/post/chainlink-vrf">verifiable random functions</a>. By choosing whether to reveal commitments, tokens can “evolve” and be directed through preset paths. Dynamism can also be achieved through recursive inscriptions and reinscriptions. Recursive inscriptions are a misnomer, as they’re not truly recursive, but they can point to another inscription for their attributes. Reinscriptions involve adding more data to an inscription but cannot overwrite data. Reinscribing on a sat that’s used as an endpoint for a recursive inscription allows the network to be used as a dynamic, write-only database.</p><h3>Runes</h3><p><a href="https://docs.ordinals.com/runes.html">Runes</a> are a highly anticipated new fungible <a href="https://rodarmor.com/blog/runes/">token standard</a> that will launch at the halving in April. Unlike BRC-20s, Runes <a href="https://twitter.com/BobBodily/status/1773188935566655669">operates</a> in a UTXO model (the accounting model Bitcoin uses) rather than an account-based model. This enables more flexibility and theoretically introduces the ability to integrate Runes tokens into state channels like Lightning Network or client-side validated (CSV) environments like <a href="https://rgb.tech/">RGB</a>.</p><p><a href="https://magiceden.io/ordinals/marketplace/runestone">Runestone</a>, currently the largest Ordinal collection by market cap with 5,300 BTC, is a placeholder project for a Runes token. There are also other placeholder projects built on current standards, such as RSIC.</p><p>With the high value of Runes placeholders and Ordinals projects in general, there’s <a href="https://t4t5.com/blog/the-bitcoin-halving-will-be-reorged/">speculation</a> that the first block of the new epoch (at the halving in April) will be reorganized (reorged), as a form of MEV. A <a href="https://learnmeabitcoin.com/technical/blockchain/chain-reorganisation/">reorg</a> involves a new longest chain being discovered due to multiple miners creating blocks at the same time. In the case of the halving, a reorg could happen due to a miner intentionally building atop their own initial halving block that they know wasn’t first. Doing so would build a longer chain that could overtake the consensus longest chain. In this case, miners would forego rewards from multiple blocks in the process, but they could profit if users were to <a href="https://t4t5.com/blog/the-bitcoin-halving-will-be-reorged/">pay millions</a> of dollars for block 840,000, the halving block.</p><p>The value proposition for owning rights to block 840,000 would be the right to create some of the first Runes tokens (and collect an Epic sat, explored further in the Rare Sats section). Early Ordinals projects became valuable simply for being early (e.g., sub1k and sub10k collections). Conversely, the cost of a reorg could make it an easy financial decision for miners with the resources. The concept of miners selling the rights to a block has already been established and formalized by various mining pools and companies, as detailed above in the Mining and Security section.</p><h3>Rare Sats</h3><p>Another outcome of Ordinal Theory was <a href="https://help.magiceden.io/en/articles/8405973-magic-eden-s-guide-to-rare-sats">rare sats</a>. Rare sats are satoshis with some history associated with them, almost like an organic NFT, with built-in metadata, fractionalized into shared that can be traded like fungible tokens. Because sats are tracked through a consensus method, users can recognize specific sats with special characteristics, such as belonging to certain wallets, being mined by certain people, or being spent in certain events. Rare sats relating to events or history include</p><ul><li>Pizza: sats from the 10,000 BTC used to <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-magazine/2023/05/22/celebrating-bitcoin-pizza-day-the-time-a-bitcoin-user-bought-2-pizzas-for-10000-btc/">buy two pizzas</a> in 2010</li><li>First Transaction: sats from the <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/today-in-bitcoin-history-13-year-anniversary-of-transaction-between-satoshi-and-hal-finney">first Bitcoin transaction</a>, where Satoshi Nakamoto sent 10 BTC to Hal Finney</li><li>Nakamoto: sats mined by Satoshi Nakamoto</li></ul><p>Other rare sats are not special because of their usage, but rather their positioning according to Ordinal Theory.</p><ul><li>Palindrome: sats whose Ordinal number is the same forward and backward</li><li>Alpha: the first sat in a bitcoin</li><li>Omega: the last sat in a bitcoin</li><li>Epic: the first sat in the first bitcoin of an epoch</li></ul><p>No Epic sats are currently listed for sale, but the first sats in each difficulty period (two weeks as opposed to four years for Epic sats) routinely sell for multiple BTC. A new Epic sat will be created during the halving in mid-April and will likely be extremely valuable on secondary markets. Situations like this one could also weigh into the feasibility of a reorg battle over the first block of the epoch, along with Runes.</p><h2>Layer Analysis</h2><p>The excitement and demand for programmability extended past base-layer meta-protocols and into the world of <a href="https://www.bitcoinlayers.org/">Bitcoin layers</a> (i.e., protocols scaling or adding increased functionality to Bitcoin). <a href="https://bitvm.org/">BitVM</a> opened the door for new bridging mechanisms and ideas for enforcing transaction validity. BitVM is a <a href="https://stacker.news/items/435328">strategy</a> for executing arbitrary computation anywhere and then verifying it on Bitcoin. It’s important to note that BitVM is an abstract protocol, not a specific instantiation of a protocol; builders can implement BitVM-style verification for various tools or protocols, such as <a href="https://lightco.in/2024/02/13/bitstake/">bridges</a>, Super’s <a href="https://supertestnet.github.io/8bit-cpu-for-bitvm/">8-bit CPU</a> and <a href="https://supertestnet.github.io/tapleaf-circuits/">Tapleaf Circuits</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/robin_linus/status/1776152948927574210">Blake3</a> hash lock verification.</p><p>While certain <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinLayers/status/1770147876376617251">dimensions of Layer-2s</a> (L2s), such as data availability, are more straightforward, they still require some innovation to scale enough to support dozens of layers. Up until recent developments (i.e., BitVM), functions such as the aforementioned trustless bridging and enforcing transaction validity were believed by many to be impossible without a <a href="https://cointelegraph.com/learn/soft-fork-vs-hard-fork-differences-explained">soft fork</a> (i.e., a backward-compatible protocol upgrade).</p><p>This development has sparked a frenzy of Bitcoin layers, dubbed the “Bitcoin L2 Season.” The vast majority of Bitcoin layers today are not real L2s, with few exceptions like the state channel-based Lightning Network. Real L2s are primarily <a href="https://bitcoin-layers.gitbook.io/bitcoin-layers/what-is-a-bitcoin-l2-or-layer">defined</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinLayers/status/1770147878482178360">unilateral exits</a>. The rest are mainly sidechains working towards less custodial and more Bitcoin-integrated models, such as rollups, as the technology becomes available.</p><h3>Programmable Layers</h3><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/3937309f1f9276b2f33997dd21bb0af9742aef89-1600x1023.png?w=800" /><p>In Q1, Incumbents <a href="https://rootstock.io/">Rootstock</a> and <a href="https://messari.io/report/state-of-stacks-q4-2023">Stacks</a> led programmable layers in terms of TVL at $202 million and $179 million, respectively. Newer layers, <a href="https://twitter.com/build_on_bob">BOB</a> and <a href="https://merlinchain.io/">Merlin</a>, grew incredibly fast in Q1, with BOB exceeding $100 million in TVL in the first week of live deposits and Merlin ending the quarter with $92 million in TVL after launching in February. BOB is not yet live, but it does have a points program active with its deposits. Merlin had a similar strategy, launching a points program with deposits before going live. Other layers in mainnet include <a href="https://messari.io/report/understanding-core-chain">Core Chain</a>, an EVM sidechain, and <a href="https://liquid.net/">Liquid</a>, a partially-programmable federated sidechain.</p><p>Much of this TVL growth has come from non-BTC assets, as Rootstock and Stacks only have about 3,000 and 300 BTC locked, respectively. This is far shy of Lightning Network’s 5,000 BTC and doesn’t come <a href="https://twitter.com/TheVladCostea/status/1742613053600874977">anywhere close</a> to BTC locked on alt-L1s. <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x2260fac5e5542a773aa44fbcfedf7c193bc2c599">Ethereum</a> and <a href="https://tronscan.org/#/token20/TN3W4H6rK2ce4vX9YnFQHwKENnHjoxb3m9">TRON</a> host nearly 300,000 BTC combined, with other networks such as <a href="https://snowtrace.io/token/0x152b9d0FdC40C096757F570A51E494bd4b943E50">Avalanche</a> and <a href="https://bscscan.com/address/0x7130d2a12b9bcbfae4f2634d864a1ee1ce3ead9c#notes">BNB</a> hosting several thousand each.</p><p>There are <a href="https://www.bitcoinlayers.org/">over 40</a> total layers either in mainnet, testnet, or only announced. Many layers, such as <a href="https://docs.citrea.xyz/">Citrea</a>, intend to launch as rollups and are <a href="https://twitter.com/citrea_xyz/status/1768276018077589591">open-sourcing</a> BitVM implementations along the way. Similar to the Ethereum L2 space, many projects — such as <a href="https://twitter.com/BitlayerLabs">Bitlayer</a> and <a href="https://x.com/moleculebtc">Molecule</a> — are exploring execution environments other than the EVM, such as Cairo or the Solana VM. Even mining companies are getting involved, as Marathon announced its own layer, <a href="https://subscribe.bitcoinbuildersassociation.com/p/marathon-digital-launches-anduro">Anduro</a>.</p><p>Ultimately, there is still plenty of work to be done before achieving true Bitcoin rollups. BitVM is currently the most anticipated strategy, but it still doesn’t enable unilateral exits. The first iteration of BitVM detailed a strategy for a bridge with a federated 1-of-N trust assumption. More recently, in March 2024, <a href="https://gist.github.com/RobinLinus/2251939ba074bd8af80a3826b1983246">BitVM 2</a> was presented, which would enable a permissionless 1-of-N trust assumption. The model would be a significant improvement in risk and custody, as permissionless verification is closer to the optimistic / fraud-proof model popular on Ethereum.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/0a16b0542ebc782c011466e8743512840835abab-3200x1950.jpg?w=800" /><p>BitVM is not a silver bullet for trust-minimized bridging, and a BitVM-based bridge has yet to reach production while the community still <a href="https://redvelvetzip.substack.com/p/are-bitvm-bridges-economically-secure">explores</a> the sustainability of various models. Additionally, soft forks are being explored for several functionalities (e.g., <a href="https://twitter.com/ercwl/status/1747349610715111453">CAT</a>, <a href="https://app.sigle.io/polydeuces.id.stx/bo-iHio5_4iTlvWwXwZ9l">CTV</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bo-quy3VzUM">TXHASH</a>, and CSFS), which would enable <a href="https://covenants.info/">covenants</a> and other ways to easily activate <a href="https://delvingbitcoin.org/t/aggregate-delegated-exit-for-l2-pools/297">real</a> L2s. Even so, any new functionalities would be <a href="https://twitter.com/chainway_xyz/status/1742607389679927659">complementary</a> to <a href="https://medium.com/@twhittle/bitvm-bridges-considered-unsafe-9e1ce75c8176">existing</a> strategies, not rivalrous. Considering how notoriously difficult it is to organize a fork on Bitcoin, BitVM remains one of today’s most promising routes toward more-sovereign bridges.</p><h3>Lightning and State Channels</h3><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/d4e736ac128d18ff4b34811ef7c683afca41469e-1280x720.png?w=800" /><p>First introduced in 2015, Lightning Network’s state-channel-based scaling approach has gradually become the most <a href="https://twitter.com/SDWouters/status/1711758165941923907">popular</a> scaling solution. Lightning uses built-in features on Bitcoin L1, such as multisigs and <a href="https://docs.lightning.engineering/the-lightning-network/multihop-payments/hash-time-lock-contract-htlc">hashed timelocked contracts</a> (HTLCs), to facilitate the locking and unlocking of BTC with unilateral exits.</p><p>Lightning saw increased adoption from custodians in 2023. While this increases accessibility to users, it also contributes to Lightning's already high centralization. <a href="https://zapalytics.com/">Over 90%</a> of transfers and addresses are facilitated through centralized solutions, with self-custody and self-hosting proving to be too cumbersome for many users.</p><p>Lightning exists at the top of the “<a href="https://twitter.com/TO/status/1717570031943335999">Bitcoin L2 Trilemma</a>,” as an offchain network. On offchain networks, the risk of self-custody and self-hosting is that users would lose funds if they go offline. <a href="https://twitter.com/super_testnet/status/1772647977892405739">Hedgehog</a> is an alternative state channel model that supports asynchronous payments, alleviating some of the aforementioned issues. There are also other models that iterate or improve on aspects of Lightning, such as Ark which offers privacy.</p><p>A Bitcoin/Lightning developer disclosed a class of vulnerabilities referred to as <a href="https://twitter.com/mononautical/status/1715736832950825224">replacement cycle attacks</a> in October 2023. To fix these vulnerabilities, a soft fork would be required. Even without the additional functionalities (e.g., smart contracts or privacy) that most other Bitcoin layers aspire to deliver, Lightning has protocol issues of its own to deal with.</p><h2>ETF Analysis</h2><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/56ecfebec2d29fa5e3be7ca2b9ff50e5a33d6d76-1280x720.png?w=800" /><p>Nine new Spot ETFs and one ETF conversion were <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/10/sec-approves-rule-changes-that-pave-the-way-for-bitcoin-etfs.html">approved</a> and launched on January 10, 2024. The events marked a pivotal moment in BTC’s legitimization by the U.S. government and traditional finance. The ETFs have been wildly successful by almost any standards, pulling in over $12 billion in inflows in the first month.</p><p>In under a week, BTC ETFs <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/markets/bitcoin-surpasses-silver-to-become-second-largest-etf-commodity-in-the-us">surpassed</a> silver ETFs in AUM but are still far behind gold ETFs, at $90+ billion. Institutions were eclipsed next, as MicroStrategy — the largest institutional holder — only holds 215,000 BTC.</p><p>In total, the ETFs had $12.4 billion in inflows in Q1, or 212,000 BTC, bringing the total AUM to 831,488 BTC. Ignoring GBTC, which had already existed as a BTC Trust, the new nine ETFs took in 493,807 BTC in Q1. Access to the ETFs will only grow throughout the rest of 2024, as advisors will gradually be <a href="https://twitter.com/BTC_Archive/status/1773795445975769184">permitted</a> to sell these new funds to clients.</p><p>For reference, all ETFs combined had roughly <a href="https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/trading-investing/etf-flows">$598 billion</a> in inflows during 2023. IBIT and FBTC, the two highest-performing BTC ETFs, had $13.9 billion and $7.5 billion in inflows in Q1 2024, respectively. While there are hundreds of live ETFs, only <a href="https://www.morningstar.com/etfs/etfs-cap-off-another-year-inflows-style">nine</a> pulled in at least $12 billion in inflows for the entirety of 2023, let alone a single quarter.</p><p>Of those top nine ETFs by inflow from 2023, <a href="https://www.etf.com/tools/etf-fund-flows-tool?startDate=2024-01-01&amp;endDate=2024-03-31">here’s</a> how they did in Q1 2024:</p><ul><li>VOO: $23.9 billion</li><li>IVV: $13.9 billion</li><li>VTI: $8.0 billion</li><li>AGG: $4.8 billion</li><li>BND: $3.4 billion</li><li>JEPI: $1.6 billion</li><li>RSP: $1.2 billion</li><li>TLT: -$0.35 billion</li><li>SPY: -$9.1 billion</li></ul><p>The ETF issuers have had varying levels of onchain activity, but in general, TradFi incumbents are truly <a href="https://twitter.com/FTI_DA/status/1775552645689749905">paying attention</a>. After receiving community feedback, the Bitwise team <a href="https://twitter.com/BitwiseInvest/status/1757813223536103568">upgraded</a> the <a href="https://blockchain.news/wiki/know-your-bitcoin-address-differences-between-legacy-nested-segwit-and-native-segwit-formats">wallet format</a> used for funds. With its onchain addresses posted publicly, multiple users actually <a href="https://twitter.com/Leishman/status/1750268585266561158">sent sats</a> to it. The team <a href="https://twitter.com/hongkim__/status/1750972104600904019">announced</a> that sats sent to their addresses would be added to NAV and accrue to shareholders, with the exception of tokens coming from OFAC-sanctioned addresses. Bitwise, like nearly all other issuers, uses Coinbase as its custodian. Over 80% of BTC ETF assets are custodied with Coinbase, with the exception of Fidelity’s and VanEck’s funds.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/0e4746577c54e5624c9f834141f21f3b3b3ef779-3200x1770.jpg?w=800" /><p>The supplies on exchanges and held by miners decreased 1.7% and 0.5% QoQ, respectively. The AUM of BTC ETFs was roughly 50% of that of exchanges or miners, after only existing for a couple of months. These relationships may change after the halving, particularly for miners, who are collecting that issuance.</p><h2>Closing Summary</h2><p>Ordinal Theory emphasized the demand for added functionality, and then BitVM made expressive and trust-minimized L2s seem possible. These developments triggered the current renaissance of programmability in the Bitcoin ecosystem. In Q1, tokens on Bitcoin exceeded billion-dollar market caps, generated over $10 million in daily NFT sales volumes, and primarily drove network activity and fees.</p><p>Ecosystem builders are working to introduce more functionality through Bitcoin layers of various architectures. Miners are getting directly involved with the new revenue streams created from said programmability, with some even launching their own layers.</p><p>In addition to all of these new ways to utilize BTC on Bitcoin or other decentralized networks, TradFi is diving into BTC with the new spot ETFs, crushing other ETFs in inflows with over $12 billion in Q1. These utilization methods are likely to see continued adoption in 2024 as they mature and new institutions get involved.</p></div>

<title>Understanding Chromia: A Comprehensive Overview</title>
<link>https://messari.io/article/understanding-chromia</link>
<guid>https://messari.io/article/understanding-chromia</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。Chromia是一个数据中心层1平台，旨在横向扩展以处理并行任务，优化高性能AI和游戏应用程序。Chromia最近与AI驱动的游戏工作室Ultiverse集成。应用程序在Chromia上的构建作为侧链运行，Chromia的数据库中心方法非常适合需要复杂查询和索引的应用程序。文章详细介绍了Chromia的技术、令牌经济学、网络活动和未来发展路线。Chromia通过引入不同的节点类，优化了主机费用，并具有治理机制，以提高网络安全性。其与各种合作伙伴关系可预示着未来发展方向，包括丰富的游戏生态系统和应用程序集成。 <div>
<div><h2>Key Insights</h2><ul><li><strong>Chromia is a data-centric Layer 1 platform that is engineered for horizontal scaling to handle parallel tasks, optimized for high-performance AI and gaming applications.</strong></li><li><strong>Launching its mainnet in early Q3 2024,</strong> Chromia recently integrated with Ultiverse, an AI-driven gaming studio.</li><li>Applications building on Chromia operate as sidechains, and <strong>Chromia's database-centric approach is ideal for applications requiring complex queries and indexing.</strong></li></ul><p></p><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Chromia stands out among Layer-1 blockchains due to its innovative approach during Ethereum's early scaling challenges. As ETH’s gas fees climbed, alternative Layer-1 (alt-L1) solutions were developed to optimize scalability. Chromia distinguishes itself from these other solutions by leveraging relational databases for efficient data storage and retrieval.</p><p>Just as Ethereum adopted a modular approach to address its shortcomings, the design space for alt-L1s has significantly evolved. Both integrated and modular strategies now strive to attract applications and developers by offering specified tradeoffs in functionality and performance. Chromia positions itself towards data querying capabilities via its modular blockchain and is attracting gaming and AI projects by handling computationally intensive data storage.</p><h2>Background</h2><p>Chromia was created in 2019 by the Swedish-backed Chromaway. Chromaway's founding team — Or Perelman, Henrik Hjelte, and Alex Mizrahi — have deep roots in crypto, tracing back to the inception of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Mizrahi, in particular, made early contributions to the concept of the Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanism and played a pivotal role in <a href="https://allquantor.at/blockchainbib/pdf/rosenfeld2012overview.pdf">Colored Coins</a>. This pioneering project introduced the idea of “tokens,” which Ethereum later popularized. The Chromia team recently <a href="https://twitter.com/YeouJie">welcomed</a> Yeou Jie Goh, previously the head of portfolio at Defiance Capital. In January 2024, he stepped into the role of Head of APAC at Chromia.</p><p>Arrington Capital <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/chromia/investor_financials">led</a> Chromia’s latest funding round in 2019, and its seed round occurred in 2018, led by <a href="https://www.cypherhunter.com/en/e/chromia-raised-funding-2018-08-23/">TGE Capital</a>. Chromia hasn’t raised capital in 5 years, and all private sale and investor tokens are fully vested.</p><p>The Chromia whitepaper was <a href="https://chromia.com/documents/Chromia-_-Platform-white-paper2019.pdf">published</a> in May 2019, and the team aims to launch its mainnet in Q3 2024. These extended development timelines were primarily due to the Chromia team developing its wallet, block explorer, bridge, and blockchain in-house. As the mainnet launch approaches, the robustness of these innovations will soon be tested.</p><h2>Technology</h2><p>Chromia's modularity exists in separating the settlement and execution layers. The structure in which the state machine stores information uses a relational database. Ethereum, on the other hand, uses an account-based structure.</p><h3>Postchains</h3><p>Postchains are the most important innovation in Chromia design. Postchains are designed to store data, including blockchain metadata and application state, within a relational database. Additionally, they enable a single database to host multiple blockchains and permit one blockchain to access data from another once the data has been committed. This approach streamlines inter-blockchain interactions by allowing chains to query easily shared data, reducing complexity.</p><h3>ICMF and ICCF</h3><p>Chromia sends data between chains through two protocols called <a href="https://docs.chromia.com/cross-chain/icmf">ICMF</a> (Interchain Messaging Facility) and <a href="https://docs.chromia.com/cross-chain/iccf">ICCF</a> (Interchain Confirmation Facility).</p><p>ICMF leverages the anchoring hierarchy for sending messages across chains and facilitates various internal cross-chain communications, including managing application updates.. It first allows chains to post messages to a topic and then allows other chains to subscribe to any messages on that specific topic. Using the anchoring hierarchy as a communication channel, ICMF guarantees messages' eventual delivery and order. It also does not require that chains be in the same cluster to communicate.</p><p>ICCF also uses anchoring hierarchy, but instead of sending a message, it constructs a proof of a transaction. It then submits this proof client-side to the receiving blockchain, which validates it using the anchoring structure. While ICCF is faster and more efficient, it requires client-side interaction and has no guarantees, as the client can fail. In this scenario, ICCF would need to recreate and resubmit the proof. ICCF proofs are used for cross-chain transfers, implemented in Chromia’s <a href="https://blog.chromia.com/ft4-released/">FT4 token standard</a>.</p><p>Both optimize the development process for developers by enabling them to utilize <a href="https://docs.chromia.com/getting-started/dev-setup/database-setup">PostgreSQL</a> for data storage and querying. The traditional virtual machine architecture is not readily compatible with Chromia's relational data model, as it necessitates encoding queries. To address this, Chromia adopted <a href="https://docs.chromia.com/category/rell-language">Rell</a> (Relational Language) for its programming needs. Designed to be similar to Python and Kotlin, Rell aims to reduce the learning curve for developers, facilitating easier adoption and transition.</p><h3>Consensus</h3><p>Each application on Chromia has its own blockchain. These blockchains are run by a set of nodes using a lightly modified version of Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) consensus, called <a href="https://docs.chromia.com/overview/consensus">eBFT</a>. Each blockchain within Chromia is associated with a set of validators and is hosted on a subset of nodes that establish consensus on any modifications to the application state. Chromia software runs on nodes controlled by individuals or organizations called providers. Chromia currently has four clusters, a group of network nodes collectively running the same blockchains. Mainnet launch will ultimately reveal the actual throughput and scalability of the network; however, the current appnet projections include:</p><ul><li>~1 second confirmation times</li><li>&gt; 500 transactions per second (TPS) per sidechain</li><li>&gt; 100,000 updates and reads per second</li></ul><p>For clusters, Chromia has internally tested around 33,000 TPS for three clusters, and the team has indicated it would scale linearly with an increase in clusters.</p><p>Chromia achieves horizontal scalability by dividing its structure into multiple blockchains, where each node processes data exclusively to its designated chain. This model enhances scalability by ensuring that updates on one blockchain do not impact others, effectively creating a cohesive "system" of blockchains integral to Chromia's architecture.The system chains include:</p><ul><li><strong>Directory Chain </strong>tracks all providers, nodes, application blockchains, and their validators.</li><li><strong>Economy Chain </strong>keeps track of token distribution and is for CHR only.</li><li><strong>Anchoring Chain </strong>defends attacks against a subset of nodes. It also records block hashes from other chains, helping to detect consensus failures. Chromia has one cluster anchor chain, which anchors all chains upstream from the original chain.</li></ul><p></p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/643c488bba20dc7ce0c7ebaa8f35cb38eadad255-1674x1018.png?w=800" /><p>Source: <a href="https://chromia.com/documents/Chromia-_-Platform-white-paper2019.pdf">Chromia Whitepaper</a></p><p><br /></p><p>Thus, applications building on Chromia operate as sidechains. Chromia's database-centric approach is ideal for applications requiring complex queries and indexing. In this model, applications compensate nodes for hosting services. Doing so allows developers to set their own policies based on the resources allocated to an application. Essentially, nodes seek compensation for server provision without concern for the application's function. However, this method can lead to inefficiencies: uniform compute allocation across nodes can result in some underutilization while others reach total capacity.</p><p>Chromia addresses this by introducing varied node classes tailored to specific needs, including application demands, provider capacity, and hardware availability. This flexibility lets applications fine-tune their hosting fees based on their unique requirements. Within the Chromia ecosystem, hosting fees and transactions utilize CHR as the standard currency.</p><h2><br />Tokenomics</h2><p>One billion CHR tokens were created upon network launch. However, 22 million tokens were burned in May 2020, resulting in a maximum supply of 978 million CHR. In May 2019, 49 million CHR were initially unlocked during the token generation event.</p><p><br /></p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/7732bc2130d2d7d489a2ab81e9a1fb2da2a2990e-1600x900.png?w=800" /><p>The full distribution breakdown is as follows:</p><ul><li>37.25% to the ecosystem.</li><li>25% to the promotional fund.</li><li>19.4% to private sale investors.</li><li>4.5% to the founders.</li><li>4% to CHR’s initial launch.</li><li>3% to the auto conversion contract.</li><li>2.93% to the team.</li><li>2% to Chromia’s system node.</li><li>1.92% to Chromia’s advisors.</li></ul><p>CHR was initially issued as an ERC-20 token, but once Chromia launches on mainnet, it will convert to Chromia's native token. As of writing, CHR has a fully diluted market cap of $316 million with a token price of $0.41. The remaining token distribution includes 9.4 million for founders, 57.1 million for promotional activities, and 16.5 million reserved for the auto-conversion contract, activating with the mainnet launch. This allocation represents an approximate value of $34 million USD, vested monthly until the complete token release in December 2024. Chromia tokens serve multiple key functions within the Chromia ecosystem:</p><ul><li>They are utilized by dApps to cover hosting fees, thereby rewarding the nodes like Ethereum uses tokens for transaction fees to compensate block producers.</li><li>Chromia tokens act as the primary currency within the Chromia economy. </li></ul><p>Additionally, users can stake CHR tokens to earn rewards for contributing to network security, and providers can leverage their stake for governance purposes.</p><h2>Network Activity</h2><p>Chromia incentivizes providers to secure their network by requiring them to <a href="https://chromia.com/staking/">stake</a> CHR. The staked CHR acts as collateral and would be forfeited in cases of node misbehavior. Any user can stake Chromia tokens to earn an annual governance reward of 10% APR, although this rate may be subject to future adjustments. Once staked, CHR tokens are frozen for two weeks. The staking contract is available on both the Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain (BSC) networks, enabling users to participate using standard ERC-20 wallets like MetaMask. Additionally, all applications wishing to be hosted on the Chromia testnet must stake at least 100 CHR.</p><p>In January 2024, the team <a href="https://blog.chromia.com/staking-update/">released</a> a staking update introducing a delegation mechanism, which marked a significant advancement towards improved governance. Chromia added new providers to enhance the staking interface's responsiveness. Following these updates, the provider list will be dynamically populated by accessing the Directory Chain in real-time, ensuring an up-to-date roster of potential delegates. As of writing, 28% of all circulating CHR is <a href="https://chromia.com/chr-token/">staked</a> natively on the network.</p><p>While the network is still in testnet, its appnet <a href="https://explorer.chromia.com/?network=Chromia+Appnet">currently</a> has seven live applications, twenty providers, and twenty-six active nodes. Chromia’s most popular application is <a href="https://www.myneighboralice.com/">My Neighbor Alice</a>. This fully onchain multiplayer game mixes digital farming, NFT trading, and community and is built exclusively on Chromia. My Neighbor Alice’s Alpha Season 4 has <a href="https://blog.chromia.com/jan-2024-update/">generated</a> over 1.8 million transactions despite only launching in January 2024.</p><p>Another application on Chromia, <a href="https://twitter.com/fanzeal_/status/1753265283282919561">Fanzeal</a>, is the digital collectibles marketplace for VFB Stuttgart, a top German soccer team. It aims to bring sports and entertainment onchain. In addition, Chromia has <a href="https://twitter.com/Chromia/status/1772587654187548915">partnered</a> with several game studios leading into its upcoming mainnet.</p><h2>Roadmap</h2><p>Chromia is positioning itself as the central crypto gaming chain as it seeks to cement its growth and presence. From a technical standpoint, Chromia <a href="https://explorer.chromia.com/?network=Chromia+Appnet&amp;ref=blog.chromia.com">launched</a> its block explorer, completed an EVM asset bridge, and finalized its Chromia CLI to simplify the deployment of Rell-based applications in Q4 2023.</p><p>Chromia is set to <a href="https://blog.chromia.com/economy-chain/">introduce</a> the Economy Chain, a system chain that parallels the Directory Chain and Anchoring Chain in its network structure. The Economy Chain is designed to achieve several vital objectives for the network's operation. First, it will accommodate the Native Fees app. The app allows for the leasing of containers using CHR tokens and streamlines the distribution of payments to network providers. Furthermore, the Economy Chain will function as the primary conduit for the official bridge, facilitating the transfer of CHR tokens between Ethereum and Binance Chain. It also plays a critical role in the circulation of CHR tokens, acting as the origin point for tokens entering the ecosystem from Chromia's side. </p><p>Before its mainnet launch, Chromia faces two key challenges: implementing a native fee system to compensate network providers with CHR tokens and finalizing integrating its FT4 (Chromia’s token standard) bridge to support native CHR transactions. These updates are anticipated to be completed in Q1 2024.</p><p>From a business development perspective, Chromia partnered with <a href="https://playtoearn.net/en/news/ultiverse-gains-4m-for-its-ai-driven-gaming-platform">Ultiverse</a>, an AI-gaming hub, and <a href="https://twitter.com/chainofalliance?lang=en">Chain of Alliance</a>. Although Chromia is not yet operational, the anticipated launch of these projects is expected to draw considerable attention to the platform.</p><p>In February 2024, Chromia also <a href="https://blog.chromia.com/chromia-x-rstlss/">announced</a> a strategic partnership with RSTLSS, a platform that enables users to design personalized digital assets effortlessly. The collaboration aims to make digital creation accessible to everyone. Chromia aims to streamline the app experience to be universally symbiotic. RSTLSS is focused on ensuring its user-generated content (UGC) beta is accessible, even to those without programming knowledge. Through this collaboration, the main drivers for enhancing the Chromia gaming ecosystem include cross-game asset sharing, intellectual property crossovers, and expanding RSTLSS's innovative tooling to more games.</p><p>Furthermore, Chromia integration with Rell enables relational database querying capabilities. This helps position Chromia as a promising network for broader applications, including AI. The platform's efficient data storage and retrieval system presents a compelling case for developers, especially when most blockchains struggle to handle extensive computational demands.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>With its modular architecture rooted in relational database principles, Chromia presents a distinct proposition in the crowded Layer-1 ecosystem. The programming language Rell introduces advanced data storage capabilities, enabling comprehensive onchain data management directly on the network.</p><p>Chromia's mainnet launch is further heightened by the growing emphasis on AI and gaming. Significant competition exists with other Layer-1 networks targeting niche sectors such as gaming. Chromia's current market valuation of approximately $340 million lags behind peers like Beam and ImmutableX, valued at $1.7 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively. However, Chromia differentiates itself with a more tailored and hands-on approach to application integration. This strategic focus on business development and application onboarding will be critical for Chromia's success.</p></div>

Solana optimizes for latency and throughput, sacrificing some verifiability. It seeks to accomplish this through features such as its novel timestamp mechanism called <a href="https://solana.com/news/proof-of-history">Proof-of-History</a> (PoH), block propagation protocol <a href="https://docs.solana.com/cluster/turbine-block-propagation">Turbine</a>, and parallel transaction processing. Since mainnet launch in March 2020, several network upgrades have brought further network performance and resilience, including <a href="https://solana.com/news/solana-network-upgrades#:~:text=14%20December%202022-,QUIC,-STATUS%3A%C2%A0%C2%A0%F0%9F%9F%A2%20Live">QUIC</a>, <a href="https://solana.com/news/solana-network-upgrades#:~:text=be%20fully%20adopted.-,Stake%2Dweighted%20QoS,-STATUS%3A%C2%A0%F0%9F%9F%A2%20Live">stake-weighted Quality of Service</a> (QoS), and <a href="https://solana.com/news/solana-network-upgrades#:~:text=on%20Mainnet%2Dbeta.-,Fee%20markets,-STATUS%3A%C2%A0%F0%9F%9F%A2%C2%A0Live">local fee markets</a>.</p><p>Network and ecosystem development and growth are supported by the non-profit <a href="https://solana.org/">Solana Foundation</a>, <a href="https://solanalabs.com/">Solana Labs</a>, as well as many third-party organizations, including <a href="https://www.anza.xyz/">Anza</a>, <a href="https://www.colosseum.org/about#/">Colosseum</a>, <a href="https://www.helius.dev/">Helius</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/superteamDAO">Superteam</a>. Solana Labs has raised over $335 million in <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2019/07/30/multicoin-leads-20-million-round-for-speed-focused-solana-blockchain/">private</a> <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/06/09/solana-labs-raises-314m-in-token-sale-led-by-a16z-polychain/">and</a> <a href="https://medium.com/coinlist/solanas-launch-auction-sells-out-f9032b65c48b">public</a> token sales. The Solana ecosystem features a growing set of projects across many sectors, including DeFi, consumer, DePIN, and payments.</p><p><a href="https://solana.com/">Website</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/solana">X (Twitter)</a></p><h2>Key Metrics</h2><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/e52e26f0dfe8390ef9ad5f882938949b7d8a6ead-6568x3900.png?w=800" /><h2>Financial Analysis</h2><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/384dc28c6af58f55e5b6a92eac10ef25230a0136-6400x3716.png?w=800" /><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/8c7d09cf6016163651c542efa3406b34fd23d51d-6400x3600.png?w=800" /><p>SOL continued to be a market leader after its breakout in Q4’23.&nbsp; It remained ranked 5th among all tokens in market cap, only behind BTC, ETH, USDT, and BNB. After peaking in the last cycle at $77 billion, SOL’s market cap continues to reach all-time highs. It ended Q1’24 with a market cap of $86.4 billion, increasing by 97% QoQ. However, SOL’s price at $194 remains 25% away from its all-time high of almost $260.</p><p>Revenue, which measures all fees collected by the protocol, increased by 200% QoQ in SOL terms. With SOL’s price appreciation, total quarterly revenue in USD increased by 597% QoQ to $98.8 million. Solana reached an all-time high of almost $4.9 million in daily revenue on March 18.</p><p>Half of these fees are burned, while the other half are distributed to the block producer. The burned tokens reduced Solana’s annualized quarterly inflation rate from 5.5% to 5.2% in Q1. This was the first quarter in Solana’s history where the burn had a non-negligible impact, decreasing inflation by 6%. The issuance rate of SOL is set to continue decreasing by 15% every epoch year until it settles at 1.5%.</p><p>As of writing, 62.9% of the SOL supply eligible to be staked is staked, with these holders opting out of dilution from issuance. Note that tokens held by Solana Labs or the Foundation are not all counted as circulating despite not being locked. With the uptick in fees, the annualized real yield rate for SOL stakers increased by 104% QoQ to 2.2%.</p><p>While all SOL from the initial distribution is liquid, inflationary pressure can arise due to secondary transactions that re-lock tokens, such as grants or token purchases. Of note, Alameda and FTX bought over 57 million SOL from the Solana Foundation and Solana Labs. However, these tokens are subject to <a href="https://solana.com/news/solana-facts-ftx-bankruptcy">various unlock schedules</a>, with the <a href="https://solanacompass.com/tokenomics">average unlock date being in Q4’25</a>. Upcoming unlocks can be viewed on <a href="https://solanacompass.com/tokenomics">Solana Compass</a> and <a href="https://www.gelato.sh/stake">Gelato</a>. In early March, it was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-07/pantera-raising-money-to-buy-250-million-solana-holding-from-ftx-sol">reported</a> that Pantera was raising a fund to buy up to $250 million of SOL tokens from the FTX Estate.</p><h2>Network Analysis</h2><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/c44b953fd125cac787e776abe058962db9423d7e-6400x3900.png?w=800" /><h3>Usage</h3><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/84a1af12bde539e4155781fdf1b827badf4853f8-6400x3600.png?w=800" /><p>Network activity, measured by non-vote transactions and fee payers, continued to rise in Q1. Average daily fee payers increased by 214% QoQ to 597,000, reaching a peak of over 2 million on March 17. The growth in addresses was largely driven by memecoin trading. Average daily non-vote transactions increased by 71% QoQ to 70 million. However, 62% of non-vote transactions failed, up 10% QoQ. Failed transactions are still executed successfully – they pay fees and <a href="https://twitter.com/Austin_Federa/status/1771252857905242327">modify state</a> – but they didn’t meet the smart contract’s success criteria. <a href="https://twitter.com/0xMert_/status/1771700602629730795">Failed transactions</a> mostly come from arbitrage bots or user trades on DEXs where the price impact exceeds the set <a href="https://twitter.com/ZackPokorny_/status/1772040909028196791">slippage</a> maximum. That said, the high activity led to a suboptimal user experience, giving core and application developers more information about the necessary upgrades, further detailed in the Performance, Upgrades, and Roadmap section.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/00a0ccb236662845d728b3bde797ee1c72e8a95c-6400x3600.png?w=800" /><p>New fee payers followed a similar growth trend, reaching a high of almost 1.2 million on March 17. Average daily new fee payers increased by 266% QoQ to 115,000. New fee payers have also been retained at a higher rate. The December 2023, January 2024, and February 2024 new fee payer cohorts all had above 30% one-month retention rates, compared to an average 18% rate from January 2023 to November 2023.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/f8c7b021d867862ccfeeb56c38bebb8f4cf94eaa-6400x3648.png?w=800" /><p>The increase in network activity drove up transaction fees, with more transactions including a <a href="https://docs.solana.com/proposals/fee_transaction_priority">priority fee</a> and priority fees being set higher. The priority fee rate reached 85% by the end of the quarter. The average transaction fee increased 280% QoQ to 0.000096 SOL ($0.014). The daily average transaction fee peaked on March 21 at 0.0003 SOL ($0.06).</p><p>However, the <a href="https://flipsidecrypto.xyz/LTirrell/priority-fees-for-solana-transactions-priority-fees-for-solana-transactions-Q2p8bE">median fee</a> remained steadier. On March 21, the median fee was 0.00002 SOL ($0.004), a 4x of the minimum transaction fee of 0.000005 SOL. While local fee markets have helped reduce global fee spikes, <a href="https://www.umbraresearch.xyz/writings/solana-fees-part-1">Solana’s fee markets</a> are still not perfect. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bhh4chj-J0I">Discussions</a> about improving them continued in Q1, as detailed in the Performance, Upgrades, and Roadmap section.</p><h3>Security and Decentralization</h3><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/276c64d4043ea08c214bc01963596f743c401808-6400x3724.png?w=800" /><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/e8a61abf6c9b4567730a25ed62d0985c88103923-6400x3600.png?w=800" /><p>Staked SOL fell for the second straight quarter, down 7% QoQ. The decrease has largely been driven by FTX Estate unstaking its tokens as they unlock. However, with SOL’s price appreciation, total staked in USD terms grew by 71% QoQ to $70 billion, ranking Solana second among all networks behind Ethereum.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/f37ce5a8cb83e450ba1cb80ae51320d41e7b82b2-6400x3600.png?w=800" /><p>Solana’s Nakamoto coefficient stabilized this quarter after dropping in Q4’23, mostly due to FTX Estate’s unstaking, as Alameda/FTX staked to a wide spread of validators. While reaching yearly lows of 20, Solana’s quarter-end Nakamoto coefficient of 22 still remains above the median of <a href="https://nakaflow.io/">other networks</a>.</p><p>The Nakamoto coefficient is the minimum number of nodes needed to break liveness. The metric can also be measured across other dimensions important to the resilience of a validator network, including distribution of stake by location, hosting provider, and clients.</p><p>Solana network’s 1,711 active validators are hosted in 36 countries, up 33% YoY. The United States leads with 27% of all stake, down 10% QoQ. With Germany accounting for an 8% market share, Solana has a geographic Nakamoto coefficient of 2. Solana validators are hosted in 323 unique data centers, up 21% YoY. Solana has a data center Nakamoto coefficient of 6.</p><p>Q1 saw notable changes to both of Solana’s active validator clients, with the Agave fork of the Solana Labs client and the decision by Jito Labs to suspend the mempool in its Jito MEV client.</p><p>At the end of January, Anza <a href="https://twitter.com/anza_xyz/status/1752307820769513568">launched</a>. Anza is a Solana-focused developer shop founded by executives and engineers from Solana Labs. In early March, Anza <a href="https://medium.com/anza-xyz/learn-more-about-the-solana-labs-to-agave-fork-f8507453e639">forked</a> the Solana Labs client. It will continue development on the forked client, <a href="https://github.com/anza-xyz/agave">Agave</a>, and the Solana Labs client will be <a href="https://medium.com/anza-xyz/anza-github-migration-faq-9ab94e03f8dc#:~:text=When%20will%20the,fully%20to%20Agave.">deprecated</a> in the summer. Beyond maintaining the Agave client, Anza will work on tooling like token extensions and contribute to the development of ecosystem projects.</p><p>In early March, Jito Labs <a href="https://twitter.com/jito_labs/status/1766228889888514501">announced</a> that it would suspend its mempool offering. The decision was made following an <a href="https://twitter.com/buffalu__/status/1766475551408058463">increase</a> in <a href="https://twitter.com/0xMert_/status/1765603373351362909">sandwich</a> attacks due to the rise in <a href="https://dune.com/queries/3399030/5704521">retail DEX trading</a>. Jito Labs was largely praised by the community for putting Solana users ahead of its own revenue. Jito’s bundles and block engine continue <a href="https://twitter.com/0xMert_/status/1766232267016282269">operating</a>, and <a href="https://dune.com/queries/3380088/5671733">MEV tips</a> have not notably fallen. Due to the economic incentives, there will likely be teams that <a href="https://twitter.com/laine_sa_/status/1771052800639693112">attempt</a> to recreate Jito’s mempool offering. However, a similar offering would not be trivial to build, and even after being built, it would still require attracting validator stake, which may be difficult to do socially. Currently, 69% of stake is running the Jito client, up 43% QoQ.</p><p>As an MEV-optimized fork of the Agave client, the Jito client does not offer the same client diversity as a client written from scratch. Firedancer and Sig, two clients written from scratch, are being developed by Jump Crypto and Sig, respectively. Jump’s Frankendancer went <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEEWMiMuEF8">live</a> on testnet last quarter. It uses Firedancer’s code for networking functions but the original Labs client code for runtime and consensus mechanisms.

The outage, lasting around 5 hours, <a href="https://solana.com/news/02-06-24-solana-mainnet-beta-outage-report">stemmed</a> from a bug with the legacy loader program. The bug was previously identified on Solana’s devnet, but its fix had not yet been implemented.</p><p>The Solana network has otherwise held up despite the high demand. However, the increased network usage has led to congestion issues, worsening user experience. Identified <a href="https://twitter.com/Austin_Federa/status/1768260117529587739">issues</a> and potential solutions include:</p><ul><li>Transaction Scheduler: Solana’s transaction <a href="https://messari.io/report/state-of-solana-q4-2023#:~:text=upgrades%20are%20necessary.-,Scheduler%3A,-Solana%E2%80%99s%20scheduler%20features">scheduler</a> is responsible for building blocks. The current implementation has <a href="https://twitter.com/rexstjohn/status/1769557942523805842">limitations</a> leading to <a href="https://twitter.com/0xShitTrader/status/1756453102952091891">non-deterministic</a> transaction ordering and inclusion – it’s not guaranteed that a transaction with a higher priority fee will be ordered accordingly or have a higher probability of block inclusion. Instead, ordering and inclusion partially rely on variance and FIFO, which incentivizes spam. Anza’s Andrew Fitzgerald has driven development <a href="https://twitter.com/jacobvcreech/status/1768398882092798337">scheduler improvements</a> in the <a href="https://github.com/anza-xyz/agave/wiki/v1.18-Release-Schedule">v1.18 upgrade</a> planned for April. To ensure the new scheduler is rolled out safely, it will be optional for validators to adopt it.</li><li>Networking: The implementation of data transfer protocol QUIC in Q4’22 was one of the upgrades in response to previous spam-related network outages. While QUIC has helped eliminate spam-related outages, many have <a href="https://twitter.com/fd_ripatel/status/1769869327602184513">recently</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/aeyakovenko/status/1770428725886333125">agreed</a> it’s contributing to the network congestion issues. Core developers across the ecosystem are working on fixes. Notably, Jump’s Frankendancer testnet release last quarter <a href="https://twitter.com/fd_ripatel/status/1770801459375788502">addresses</a> these issues. While Frankendancer/Firedancer might not hit mainnet soon, its learnings can be shared to help <a href="https://twitter.com/fd_ripatel/status/1770801462785773631">improve</a> the Agave client.</li><li>Fee Market: As <a href="https://messari.io/report/state-of-solana-q4-2023#:~:text=Of%20course%2C%20Solana%E2%80%99s%20fee%20markets%20are%20not%20perfect.%20Discussions%20about%20improving%20them%20intensified%20in%20Q4.%20There%20are%20several%20inefficiencies%20being%20discussed%20by%20the%20community%20with%20debated%20solutions%2C%20including%20the%20following.">discussed</a> last quarter, Solana’s fee markets are inefficient. Of note, base fees are not determined by compute units (Solana’s equivalent of Ethereum gas units). While priority fees are priced by compute units, they’re determined by the number of compute units requested rather than used. This leads to a general lack of compute optimization incentives: transactions often request more CUs than needed, and developers don’t build programs with compute minimization top-of-mind. The v1.18 scheduler will include an <a href="https://twitter.com/apfitzge/status/1770871497198035404">upgrade</a> to prioritize transactions with fewer CUs requested, which should reduce some of these issues. There have also been discussions to raise overall blockspace limits in order to increase capacity. Lastly, some believe economic upgrades are also necessary to reduce spam. <a href="https://github.com/solana-foundation/solana-improvement-documents/pull/110">SIMD-110</a> seeks to implement EIP-1559-style markets for write lock fees. However, there is much more debate around the need for economic upgrade than for scheduler and networking upgrades. As such, any potential implementation of SIMD-110 or similar proposals is further out.</li></ul><p>The Solana Foundation also <a href="https://twitter.com/SolanaFndn/status/1768685164970778972">detailed</a> immediate steps developers can take to improve performance.

They were designed largely based on feedback from discussions with enterprises and financial institutions, but they also have use cases in more crypto-native DeFi and consumer applications.</p><p>These extensions enable features that are largely possible on other networks but currently require either developers building the infrastructure themselves or permissioned environments. Implementing them directly into the token program layer thus has several advantages:</p><ul><li>Infrastructure Support: All major wallets, applications, and other infrastructure providers will support token extensions. It would be more difficult for a project building its own solution to reach this level of ecosystem infrastructure support.</li><li>Composability: Tokens and applications that would otherwise have to be walled off in permissioned environments can co-exist on Solana mainnet with existing permissionless token experiences. Users don’t need to bridge, and applications and infrastructure providers don’t need to support another network.</li></ul><p>There are over a dozen live <a href="https://spl.solana.com/token-2022">extensions</a>, including <a href="https://messari.io/report/state-of-solana-q4-2023#:~:text=Transfer%20fees%3A%20Token%20issuers%20can%20add%20protocol%2Denforced%20fees%20on%20every%20token%20transfer.%20Options%20include%20a%20fixed%20fee%2C%20variable%20fee%2C%20and%20fee%20cap%20for%20each%20transfer.%20The%20extension%20has%20already%20been%20implemented%20by%20tokens%20like%20Bonk%20Earn%20(BERN).">transfer fees</a>, <a href="https://messari.io/report/state-of-solana-q4-2023#:~:text=Transfer%20hooks%3A,and%20so%20on.">transfer hooks</a>, and <a href="https://messari.io/report/state-of-solana-q4-2023#:~:text=Permanent%20delegate%3A,users%20if%20enabled.">permanent delegate</a>.

An initial 7% will be <a href="https://twitter.com/KaminoFinance/status/1765750290332954956">airdropped</a> linearly based on points, and another 0.5% will be <a href="https://twitter.com/KaminoFinance/status/1770474304485896517">airdropped</a> to “OGs” on a tiered basis. When Kamino announced the points snapshot, it had $440 million in TVL. Kamino’s yield protocol ended the quarter with an additional $153 million TVL, although it was not counted in Solana’s overall figures to avoid double counting.</p><p>While MarginFi lost market share, it still experienced positive QoQ growth, with its TVL increasing by 131% QoQ to $780 million. At the end of February, MarginFi <a href="https://twitter.com/marginfi/status/1762865889035317679">released</a> the <a href="https://3821122071-files.gitbook.io/~/files/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F8hWN5YwVh2AYTRXK1REu%2Fuploads%2FZaPfQS2F3hsNBySduIQ5%2Fybx_v1_final.pdf?alt=media&amp;token=660703cb-0428-4ff4-b85b-38dd93baec97">whitepaper</a> for <a href="https://ybx.marginfi.com/">YBX</a>, an upcoming LST-backed stablecoin. The whitepaper hints at a MarginFi token, noting that a governance token could help manage bad debt, similar to MKR in MakerDAO. MarginFi’s points program has been <a href="https://twitter.com/marginfi/status/1675863618666270722">running</a> since July 3, 2023, with no announcement yet on a token launch.

About 5% of total quarterly volume came from Telegram bots, an over 2x QoQ increase. BONKbot was the foremost Solana Telegram bot by volume, averaging $37 million daily volume. It collects a 1% fee on volume, used to buy BONK and distribute to <a href="https://docs.bonkbot.io/features/fee-structure">various parties</a>, including a burn (10% of the fee).

With 63% of eligible SOL supply staked, it will be critical for the liquid staking rate to continue growing to enable an ecosystem built on yield-bearing SOL.</p><p>The most notable liquid staking update this quarter was the launch of Sanctum Infinity. The Sanctum Infinity Pool is a multi-LST liquidity pool containing 22 LSTs. It prices LSTs by their <a href="https://twitter.com/sanctumso/status/1763603874038890792">“floor price”</a> relative to SOL. This allows any LST in the pool to tap into any other’s liquidity. For example, if a user wants to sell xSOL for USDC, but no xSOL/USDC pool exists, xSOL could be swapped to ySOL and sold to USDC using the ySOL/USDC pool. By allowing any LST to tap into other LST’s liquidity, Sanctum may prevent the monopolistic/oligopolistic market structures that have arisen in other liquid staking ecosystems such as Ethereum. Sanctum’s INF LST has grown its <a href="https://solana.fm/address/5oVNBeEEQvYi1cX3ir8Dx5n1P7pdxydbGF2X4TxVusJm">market cap</a> to $48 million. INF is given to users as a token receipt when they deposit into Infinity, and it accrues both staking rewards from the LSTs in the pool and trading fees from swaps.</p><p>Sanctum Infinity supports Solana’s top LSTs and a number of single-validator LSTs, many of which Sanctum has helped launch. Single-validator LSTs have offered unique rewards to attract stake, such as Bonk’s bonkSOL LST, which rewards stakers with BONK. Other single-validator LSTs, such as <a href="https://twitter.com/laine_sa_/status/1752976894780215566">laineSOL</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/knox_trades/status/1761364550845141455">jucySOL</a>, have been airdropping a portion of <a href="https://dune.com/queries/3227834/5397784">base and priority fees</a> to stakers. Validators typically do not distribute these fees to stakers. In the past, this has not mattered much as fees made up around 1% of <a href="https://dune.com/queries/3262652/5462544">total rewards</a> when combined with inflationary staking rewards. However, with the increase in Solana network activity, these fees have risen notably. During Epoch 590, from March 16-18, these fees made up over 13% of total rewards.</p><p>As for Solana’s top liquid staking protocols, Jito has been leading the pack in growth. Jito’s TVL grew by 47% QoQ to 9.4 million SOL, flipping Marinade for the top liquid staking protocol by TVL. Jito’s liquid staking market share ended the quarter nearing 50%. After Jito’s <a href="https://twitter.com/jito_sol/status/1732794280618668363">token launch</a> in December 2023, the Jito Foundation <a href="https://www.jito.network/blog/announcing-jito-foundation-delegates/">selected</a> 17 delegates to receive 12 million delegated JTO. The Jito Foundation <a href="https://forum.jito.network/t/jip-1-expanding-validator-set-protocol-development/227">posted</a> the first Jito Improvement Proposal. It proposed to expand the Jito validator set to 200 and reduce the maximum commission for eligible validators from 10% to 5%.</p><p>Marinade Liquid’s TVL decreased by 9% QoQ to 6.4 million SOL. Marinade began the <a href="https://medium.com/marinade-finance/protected-staking-rewards-and-delegation-strategy-updates-098a23f8a851">rollout</a> of <a href="https://marinade.finance/blog/introducing-protected-staking-rewards/">Protected Staking Rewards</a> (PSR) and <a href="https://forum.marinade.finance/t/proposal-delegation-strategy-updates-finally/851">delegation strategy updates</a>. PSR requires validators to put up a bond to be eligible for Marinade stake. The bond is then used to cover any losses in staking rewards due to validator performance issues, commission rugs, or other reasons. PSR will enable Marinade to expand its validator set without sacrificing APY. As such, the delegation strategy update will allow Marinade’s algorithmic delegation validator set to increase above 100, with growth tied to Marinade’s TVL, among <a href="https://messari.io/report/understanding-marinade-a-comprehensive-overview#:~:text=The%20above%20delegation%20strategy%20has%20been%20in%20effect%20since%20the%20March%202023%20delegation%20strategy%20update.%20Another%20update%20is%20in%20the%20works%2C%20which%20was%20recently%20approved%20via%20governance.%20Notable%20changes%20include%3A">other updates</a>.

Colosseum is similar to Y-Combinator – it runs an accelerator with a venture capital arm. It differs in that <a href="https://twitter.com/mattytay/status/1765562225765294313">eligibility</a> to participate comes from winning its hackathons instead of through a college-style application. Colosseum also features a <a href="https://www.colosseum.org/get-started">platform</a> where builders can discuss ideas and meet co-founders. Colosseum’s first Solana hackathon, <a href="https://twitter.com/ColosseumOrg/status/1762511921364734182">Renaissance</a>, began on March 4 and will run until April 8. Winners will be eligible for acceptance into Colosseum’s accelerator and receive $250,000 in pre-seed capital.

Hackathons and other growth initiatives are increasingly being organized by the community rather than the Solana Foundation or Solana Labs.</p><p>The flagship community-led Solana event has been mtnDAO. The month-long hacker house ran its fifth iteration in Salt Lake City in February. mtnDAO is organized by the founders of DeFi protocols Cypher and MarginFi.</p><p>A similar month-long hacker house was officially <a href="https://twitter.com/IslandDAOx/status/1767955473964114061">unveiled</a> in March.

<title>Understanding Core Chain: A Comprehensive Overview</title>

<guid>https://messari.io/article/understanding-core-chain</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br />Core Chain是比特币的扩展和可编程解决方案，具有Satoshi Plus共识机制、EVM执行环境、Core DAO治理和coreBTC桥梁。核心基金会致力于打造比特币焦点应用生态系统，吸引更多生态系统发展。计划在未来几个月内朝着更好的治理角色演变，利用激励计划促进更多生态系统发展。 <div>

Instead, those narratives were deferred to alternative protocols, mainly Ethereum. However, Bitcoin is now experiencing a renaissance of programmability, largely thanks to two recent innovations, <a href="https://rodarmor.com/blog/ordinal-theory/">Ordinal Theory</a> and <a href="https://bitvm.org/">BitVM</a>.</p><p>After the Ordinals meta-protocol and its BTC-based token standards were launched, it became undeniably clear that the Bitcoin community had a serious appetite for NFTs, fungible tokens, and general programmability. In December of 2023, <a href="https://messari.io/report/state-of-bitcoin-q4-2023#Ecosystem-Analysis">Bitcoin’s NFT sales volume</a> (including BRC-20s, which are technically nonfungible) exceeded that of Ethereum and Solana combined. This is especially significant due to their multiyear head starts of developing NFT communities.</p><p>BitVM, a strategy for executing arbitrary computation anywhere and then verifying it on Bitcoin, opened the door for new bridging mechanisms and ideas for enforcing transaction validity. While certain <a href="https://twitter.com/BitcoinLayers/status/1770147876376617251">dimensions of Layer-2s</a> (L2s), such as data availability, are more straightforward, Bitcoin L2s will still need innovations in order to scale to support dozens of layers. Up until these recent developments, other functions, such as the aforementioned trustless bridging and enforcing transaction validity, were believed by many to be impossible without a soft fork.</p><p>Ordinal Theory emphasized the demand for added functionality, and then BitVM made expressive and trust-minimized L2s seem possible. This has sparked a frenzy of Bitcoin layers, dubbed the “Bitcoin L2 Season.” However, some teams, such as the Core Foundation, were already building in the Bitcoin ecosystem and were greatly positioned to capitalize on the momentum of Bitcoin layers. While many other layers are still building towards mainnet, Core Chain offers a platform for Bitcoin programmability today.</p><h2>Background</h2><p>Core Chain is a Bitcoin layer (specifically, a sidechain) that uses the EVM and the novel Satoshi Plus consensus mechanism. Satoshi Plus is a combination of Delegated Proof of Work (DPoW) and Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS). It was designed with the goal of retaining Bitcoin’s decentralized security while achieving the scalability of more performant smart contract platforms. Parameters of Satoshi Plus, as well as other facets of the network, are governed in a decentralized fashion by Core DAO (powered by the CORE token). Core Chain is EVM-compatible, similar to Binance Smart Chain’s <a href="https://github.com/bnb-chain/bsc">implementation</a> of Geth. And finally, Core Chain features an enshrined BTC bridge, making BTC available on the network in the form of coreBTC.</p><p>The <a href="https://coredaofoundation.org/">Core Foundation</a> and Core DAO were founded in May 2022. The Core Foundation is self-funded and consists of <a href="https://coredaofoundation.org/team">contributors</a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/richrines/">Rich Rines</a> (previously a transfers engineering lead at Coinbase, and Founder and CEO at AutoReach), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cjreim/">CJ Reim</a> (Co-Founder and Managing Partner Amity Ventures, and a Genesis block Ethereum investor), <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lindsey-haswell-5190378/">Lindsey Haswell</a> (previously the Chief Legal Officer at Blockchain.com and MoonPay, and the Regulatory Director at Uber), Jack (with 10 years of technical blockchain and Web3 experience and previously an engineer for BI software), <a href="https://pt.linkedin.com/in/brendonsedo">Brendon Sedo</a> (previously the Founder/CEO of Joist and EHF Investor Fellow), Max (with 18 years of experience as an entrepreneur, engineer, and product designer), and Charles (with a MSc in Computer Science and Theory and previously a senior design developer at multiple Web3 projects).</p><h2>Technology</h2><p>There are four key features of Core Chain that separate it from its competition:</p><ul><li><a href="https://docs.coredao.org/core-white-paper-v1.0.6/satoshi-plus-consensus">Satoshi Plus</a>: the novel consensus mechanism, which is a hybrid of DPoW and DPoS</li><li><a href="https://docs.coredao.org/core-white-paper-v1.0.6/governance">Core DAO</a>: the DAO that manages onchain governance</li><li><a href="https://docs.coredao.org/developer/develop-on-core/building-on-core">EVM</a>: the adapted Ethereum virtual machine for smart contract execution</li><li>coreBTC: the enshrined Core-native bridged BTC</li></ul><h3>Satoshi Plus</h3><p>Core Chain’s biggest differentiator from other Bitcoin layers (and merge-mining in general) is its Satoshi Plus consensus mechanism. Satoshi Plus is a hybrid model of Delegated Proof-of-Work (DPoW) and Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS).</p><p>DPoW is performed by Bitcoin miners and mining pools who delegate their existing Bitcoin hash rate to select validators on Core Chain. DPoS is performed by CORE tokenholders staking/delegating their CORE tokens to select validators on Core Chain. The DPoW hash and DPoS stake contribute to the calculation of a weighted score that determines which validators qualify for the next round of block creation. Certain parameters of the weighting are variable and set by the Core DAO; currently, the weighting ratio is two-thirds to hash and one-third to stake.</p><p>This hybrid model separates block production from Bitcoin miners, which removes any possible incentives for Bitcoin miners to censor Core Chain. This novel approach combats a <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/791.pdf">classic issue</a> with merge-mining (and other forms of parent-child shared security). In this issue, the security provider network can perform MEV or censorship on the child chain with no penalties and no incentives not to, as they are theoretically more aligned with the parent chain than the child chain.</p><h4>Network Participant Roles</h4><p>Participants in Satoshi Plus consensus include Bitcoin miners, CORE stakers, validators, relayers, verifiers, and Core DAO. Together, they secure the Core network through PoW and DPoS, as well as adjust consensus-related variables through an onchain governance process.</p><p><strong>Bitcoin Miners</strong></p><p>Bitcoin miners and mining pools participate in Satoshi Plus consensus by mining Bitcoin blocks and subsequently delegating the blocks to a Core validator in each block they produce. This process involves adding the data to the <a href="https://opcodeexplained.com/opcodes/OP_RETURN.html">op_return</a> field, a data field for including arbitrary data used in many other network functions such as inscriptions. The consensus process signals to the Core network that a miner is delegating their hash to that validator and participating in Satoshi Plus. It comes at no additional cost to the miner, and miners can even include their own Core address in order to receive the CORE tokens distributed in the consensus process.</p><p>Because this process comes at no cost to the miner, it carries no guarantees that a participating Bitcoin miner is aligned with Core. Consequently, block production is managed by a distinct role, the validator, to whom miners delegate their hashing power.</p><p>This flavor of shared security is on an individual opt-in basis per miner. It’s also non-rivalrous, meaning that a single miner does not exclude themself from participating in merge-mining or shared security for another network (e.g., PoX with <a href="https://messari.io/report/state-of-stacks-q4-2023">Stacks</a>) by delegating hash to a Core validator. The exception to this non-rivalrous nature could be if other shared security models also require data to be posted in the op_return field, which has a size limit of 80 bytes.</p><p><strong>CORE Stakers</strong></p><p>CORE token stakers participate in Satoshi Plus by delegating CORE tokens to validators on Core Chain.</p><p><strong>Validators</strong></p><p>Validators take part in Satoshi Plus by both running validator hardware and staking their own CORE tokens. Miners delegate hash, and delegators delegate stake to validators, which, combined with their own stake, create their weighting scores. As an open and permissionless system, validators can also run Bitcoin miners themselves and delegate hash to themselves if they choose.</p><p>Also, liquid staking is <a href="https://medium.com/@core_dao/launching-liquid-staking-on-core-introducing-stcore-657171f52a9f">natively available</a> through the stCORE token. This theoretically increases consensus participation, as users don’t have to choose between staking and utilizing liquidity in DeFi or other protocols.</p><p><strong>Relayers and Verifiers</strong></p><p>Relayers participate in Satoshi Plus by relaying Bitcoin block headers to the Core network via the onchain light client. Like all other roles in Satoshi Plus, the set of relayers is permissionless. Anyone can participate by registering and locking up a refundable CORE token deposit. However, relayers must both register and pass verification in order to earn rewards.</p><p>Verifiers participate in Satoshi Plus by identifying and reporting malicious actions within the network. If successful, validators may have their stake slashed or be jailed outright. Verifiers are compensated for their monitoring when block rewards are dispensed. Acting as a verifier is permissionless.</p><h4>Consensus Process</h4><p><strong>Weighting</strong></p><p>Both hash power (from Bitcoin miners) and staked CORE tokens (from CORE delegators) are combined to create an overall score. The formula for weighting uses only one dynamic variable, the m Parameter. The value of this parameter is set by Core DAO and can be changed at any time through a vote (more on voting in the Governance section). Each validator’s hash and stake are measured as a direct linear percentage of the total value from all validators, and the m Parameter dictates the weighting for hash and stake inversely. In other words, an m Parameter of 0.3 would mean hash represents 30% of the total weight and stake represents 70% of the total stake.</p><p><em>      S = rHp / tHp * m + rSp / tSp * (1 - m)</em></p><p>Where:	</p><p><em>      rHp</em> = hash power delegated to the validator</p><p><em>      tHp </em>= total hash power</p><p><em>      rSp </em>= stake delegated to a validator</p><p><em>      tSp</em> = total stake</p><p><em>      m</em> = a dynamic weighting that can be adjusted over time</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/3aeef19368f9aa6b9d8371ae9fcb80e9b6e5f0b8-1920x1080.png?w=800" /><p>Measuring stake is straightforward, as Satoshi Plus uses a linear voting mechanism (i.e., one CORE token equals one vote). Hash is slightly more complicated, as it’s exogenous. relayers fetch BTC block information to bring Bitcoin’s consensus data into Core Chain’s environment, and block production is used to estimate hash. Hash is represented by the number of blocks produced by any miner, as over the long term, this ratio should be directly equivalent to a miner’s share of the total hashrate.</p><p>Every round (roughly one day), hash power is calculated by counting the number of blocks produced by participating miners from exactly one week prior (i.e., today’s hash delegations are decided by last week’s block production).</p><p><strong>Validator Election and Leader Selection</strong></p><p>The top 21 validators system is ranked by the weighted score of hash and stake. These validators are able to participate in block production. Core uses its Validator Election mechanism to rank the top 21 validators based on hybrid scores, creating the validator set for a consensus period of 200 slots, known as an epoch. Each slot presents an opportunity for a block to be created and lasts 3 seconds. As such, each epoch lasts 600 seconds, or 10 minutes, and gives a validator up to 10 chances to create a block once accepted for an epoch.</p><p>Because slots are distributed in a round-robin pattern, not randomly, each validator is guaranteed at least 9 slots( i.e., opportunities) to create a block. If a validator misbehaves, it can be jailed and subsequently removed from the quorum for the next epoch.</p><p><strong>Rewards</strong></p><p>Block rewards, consisting of both transaction fees and a coinbase reward, are split between validators and the System Reward Contract, which pays out relayers and verifiers.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/6ef149c53afacf2ed8eb7f573d7f921e1add3f71-1920x1080.png?w=800" /><p>Validators receive consensus rewards in the form of both transaction fees and a coinbase reward, all paid in CORE. Validators keep a fee (which they set as their personal commission) and then distribute the rest to miners and delegators. Hash and stake delegators are distributed rewards based on the same m Parameter that dictates the weighting between hash and stake for the Validator Election.</p><p>The System Reward Contract accumulates rewards to pay out both relayers and verifiers, which must be claimed by the parties (rather than automatically sending the tokens, as is done with validator rewards to their delegates). The current maximum caps of rewards held by the contract are 10 million CORE and 1 million CORE for relayers and verifiers, respectively. Any excess CORE rewards are burnt.</p><h3>Ethereum Virtual Machine Compatibility</h3><p>Core Chain uses the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) for its execution environment. While this environment was initially created for Ethereum, it has been adopted by many other networks, including BNB, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync.</p><p>The EVM is the most robust execution environment in crypto, with the most active developers. Solidity, a popular EVM language, is the most popular language among crypto developers. Core Chain gains access to this pervasive ecosystem, including all developer tools and crypto infrastructure known by EVM developers from Ethereum, Polygon, BNB, Avalanche, and others. <a href="https://docs.coredao.org/developer/develop-on-core/building-on-core">Toolings</a> include Remix, Hardhat, Solidity, Truffle, ethers.js, and more. Infrastructure includes MetaMask, token standards (e.g., ERC-721 or ERC-20), blockchain scanners, smart contracts, and connections to middleware such as IPFS.</p><p>Electric Capital’s 2023 developer report highlights both EVM dominance and developer interest in the broader Bitcoin ecosystem. Most notably:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.developerreport.com/developer-report?s=87-of-multi-chain-devs-work">87%</a> of multichain developers work on at least one EVM chain</li><li>Bitcoin and Ethereum account for <a href="https://www.developerreport.com/developer-report?s=bitcoin-and-ethereum-account-for">40%</a> of all crypto developers (not counting other EVM environments)</li><li><a href="https://www.developerreport.com/developer-report?s=40-of-all-bitcoin-open-source">40%</a> of all Bitcoin developers were focused on Bitcoin layers and scaling</li></ul><h3>coreBTC</h3><p>Core Chain has a BTC bridge enshrined into the protocol, which locks BTC on Bitcoin to mint coreBTC on Core Chain.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/57aead7a5516c642bfa4baa7f0b37fcf0d158013-1920x1080.png?w=800" /><p>The minting, securing, and burning of coreBTC operates as follows:</p><p>Minting coreBTC:</p><ul><li>A user sends BTC to a Locker's Bitcoin address</li><li>Porter monitors the Bitcoin blockchain and submits proof of transaction to the Core Chain smart contract</li><li>Smart contract verifies transaction via Bitcoin Light Client and mints equivalent coreBTC</li></ul><p>Protecting coreBTC:</p><ul><li>Lockers deposit overcollateralized assets as collateral</li><li>Liquidators monitor collateral ratios and force liquidation if collateral drops too low</li><li>Liquidators use coreBTC to buy Locker's tokens at discount, burning coreBTC</li><li>Guardians monitor Lockers for misbehavior like unauthorized transfers</li><li>Slash Locker's collateral as penalty, burning coreBTC equal to violation</li></ul><p>Burning coreBTC:</p><ul><li>User requests to burn coreBTC, specifying Bitcoin address</li><li>Smart contract burns coreBTC and alerts Locker</li><li>Locker sends equivalent BTC to user's address</li><li>Transaction verified by Bitcoin Light Client</li></ul><p>Key participants include:</p><ul><li>Users<ul><li>Send BTC to mint coreBTC</li><li>Request to burn coreBTC to redeem BTC</li></ul></li><li>Lockers<ul><li>Hold users' BTC on Bitcoin blockchain</li><li>Deposit overcollateralized assets as collateral</li><li>Send BTC to users redeeming coreBTC</li></ul></li><li>Porters<ul><li>Monitor Bitcoin blockchain for transactions to Lockers</li><li>Submit proof to Core Chain to initiate coreBTC minting</li></ul></li><li>Core Chain Smart Contracts<ul><li>Mint and burn coreBTC</li><li>Verify Bitcoin transactions via Light Client</li><li>Manage Locker collateral and slashing</li></ul></li><li>Bitcoin Light Client<ul><li>Verifies Bitcoin transactions for Core Chain</li></ul></li><li>Liquidators<ul><li>Monitor Lockers' collateral ratios</li><li>Force liquidation if collateral drops too low</li></ul></li><li>Guardians<ul><li>Monitor Lockers for misbehavior</li><li>Trigger slashing of Locker collateral for violations</li></ul></li><li>Slashers<ul><li>Can report Locker violations to trigger slashing</li><li>Rewarded with portion of slashed collateral</li></ul></li></ul><h2>The CORE Token</h2><p>The CORE token is used for transaction fees, staking (and mining) rewards, and governance. It has a total supply of 2.1 billion, to be distributed through block rewards over 81 years. CORE also has a minor deflationary mechanism, as it can burn excess rewards for relayers and verifiers.</p><p>The development of Core Chain was entirely self-funded. CORE’s total supply of 2.1 billion is <a href="https://medium.com/@core_dao/the-3d-blockchain-an-introduction-to-cores-distribution-and-tokenomics-c6e987ca5ae7">distributed</a> between contributors, users, miners, reserves, treasury, and relayer rewards.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/b3b8e9d2e4256f8aaf8bb9ac9bf0a15639532a8e-1280x720.png?w=800" /><h3>Governance</h3><p>Governance of Core DAO, managed through the CORE token, is in Stage 1.5, with Stage 3 being the end goal for decentralization. Changes to Core Chain are proposed through Core Improvement Proposals (CIPs) and can be proposed by any member of the community.</p><h4>Stage 1: Offchain Governance</h4><p>Proposals are made offchain and are passed with a majority vote. The voting period is seven days.</p><h4>Stage 2: Partial Onchain Governance</h4><p>If passed, the next stage of governance would allow changing fixed parameters with onchain voting. The m Parameter is already subject to governance, but this would extend it to other variables, such as the percentage of burned fees (currently 0%). There are also discussions around adding time delays to discourage vote selling.</p><h4>Stage 3: Full Onchain Governance</h4><p>This Stage is not fully fleshed out and is in development by the community. Ideas include requiring collateral to post proposals.</p><h2>State of the Core Ecosystem</h2><p>Many protocols in Core Chain’s ecosystem are focused on BTC and BTC derivatives (i.e., Bitcoin-native assets based on BTC such as Ordinals NFTs). BTC is largely an underutilized asset, as the limited programmability of Bitcoin Script makes it challenging to activate BTC in conventional DeFi protocols while maintaining custody of the asset(s). With a consensus mechanism integrated with Bitcoin’s own consensus, Core Chain aims to provide a DeFi environment for protocols to utilize BTC assets with minimal trust assumptions. <a href="https://coredao.org/explore/blog/63">Core Ignition</a> is a six-month incentive program intended to catalyze more growth around Bitcoin DeFi.</p><p>Notable native projects already on Core Chain include:</p><ul><li><a href="https://glyph.exchange/">Glyph</a> — a DEX and liquidity hub</li><li>Colend — a borrowing and lending protocol</li><li><a href="https://nlx.trade/">NLX</a> — a perps DEX</li><li>Spiritdex — a Uniswap V4 style DEX</li><li><a href="https://wizardgallery.xyz/">WizardNFT</a> — an NFT marketplace for Core NFTs and bridged Bitcoin Ordinals</li><li>CoreX — a social DEX</li><li><a href="https://www.pinksale.finance/">Pinksale</a> — a launchpad</li><li>Element Wallet — a Core-native mobile app with built-in chat and wallet features, designed to be the end-to-end interface for Core Chain users.</li><li>Satoshi App — a mobile application designed for Core ecosystem airdrops, enabling users to earn tokens of protocols launching on Core Chain.</li><li><a href="https://bitstable.finance/">BitStable</a> — a stablecoin issuers that takes both BTC assets and Ethereum assets as collateral</li></ul><p>As discussed in the Technology section, Core Chain has an enshrined BTC bridge, but it also has connections with third-party bridges to interop with other ecosystems:</p><ul><li><a href="https://docs.coredao.org/developer/develop-on-core/bridging-with-core/bridging-tokens-to-core-with-layerzero">LayerZero</a> — a bridging integration that connects Core Chain to Avalanche, BNB, Arbitrum, Polygon, and other networks</li><li><a href="https://coredao.org/explore/blog/65">Multibit</a> — a BRC-20 focused bridge connecting Core Chain to Ethereum, BNB, and Bitcoin</li></ul><p>Core Chain also features cross-chain dapps and infrastructure that have originated in other ecosystems, including:</p><ul><li><a href="https://medium.com/@core_dao/introducing-pyth-network-cores-latest-infrastructure-integration-07f0c5909408?source=user_profile---------14----------------------------">Pyth</a> — an oracles service</li><li><a href="https://medium.com/@core_dao/core-is-now-supported-by-ankr-rpc-f522f108cbd0?source=user_profile---------15----------------------------https://medium.com/@core_dao/core-is-now-supported-by-ankr-rpc-f522f108cbd0?source=user_profile---------15----------------------------">Ankr</a> — an RPC service</li><li><a href="https://icecreamswap.com/?chain=core">IceCreamSwap</a> and SushiSwap — DEXs</li></ul><p>Upcoming Core ecosystems projects include</p><ul><li>NLX — a perpetuals DEX</li><li>A launchpad and DEX for bridged Ordinals (NFTs and BRC20s)</li></ul><h2>Competitive Landscape</h2><p>Bitcoin layers have proliferated dramatically since the start of 2023. A space that previously only consisted of a handful of state channels, client-side validated (CSV) networks, and sidechains, is now home to over <a href="https://www.bitcoinlayers.org/">40 projects</a>, although most are still in development.</p><p>The leading incumbents include Stacks, Rootstock, Liquid, and Lightning Network. Core Chain’s EVM-compatible, sidechain model is</p><ul><li>Similar to Stacks in that they’re both sidechains. Both networks’ consensus adaptations (Stacks’ Stacking and Core Chain’s Satoshi Plus) rely on not only Bitcoin miners but also a PoS component for added security. Stacks uses the Clarity execution environment, which does not a community as robust as the EVM one.</li><li>Similar to Rootstock in that they’re both sidechains. Both networks’ execution environments are the EVM. Rootstock uses direct merge-mining without any PoS component, unlike Core Chain’s Satoshi Plus consensus, which includes a PoS component.</li><li>Similar to Liquid in that they’re sidechains. Liquid is more limited in functionality, unlike the Turing-complete EVM execution environment of Core Chain. Liquid operates as a federation, as opposed to the open network that is Core Chain.</li><li>Unlike Lightning Network, which is a state channel. Lightning offers no added functionality (other than scaling), unlike the Turing-complete EVM execution environment of Core Chain. Lightning does not require any additional trust assumptions (i.e., users can unilaterally exit from a channel after a challenge period). Unlike Core Chain’s Satoshi Plus consensus, it places trust in Core nodes for duties such as consensus and transaction integrity.</li></ul><p>More recently, newer layers have emerged, such as BOB, Citrea, Bison, and more. Several of these entrants are leveraging the EVM as they explore the development of rollups. Currently, rollups cannot exist on Bitcoin due to technical limitations. However, this could change in a few years time, building on innovations such as BitVM to support the key features needed to be considered a rollup:</p><ul><li>Enforcing the validity of rollup transactions on Bitcoin L1 with validity or fraud proofs. With fraud proofs, it a rollup would require a permissionless and open set of challengers rather than a federated set like many of today’s BitVM-based models propos).</li><li>Storing necessary calldata on Bitcoin to recreate the rollup’s state.</li><li>BTC bridging with minimal trust assumptions, allowing for unilateral exits from the rollup back to Bitcoin L1.</li></ul><p>Many existing sidechains will likely reduce their trust assumptions and gravitate towards rollup models as the tech becomes available. Also, many of the upcoming rollups will initially launch as sidechains. This would be a similar route compared to the gradual development of Ethereum L2s, which ran in production for years before nearly any of them had working proofs (fraud or validity) to enforce transaction validity.</p><h2>Roadmap</h2><p>Core has a series of development plans on its roadmap:</p><ul><li>Non-custodial BTC Staking: A third component of Satoshi Plus, any BTC holder can use absolute time-locks to delegate their Bitcoin to Core validators in exchange for token rewards, all without giving up custody of their private keys.</li><li>Local fee markets: These can make transactions more predictable and potentially cheaper.</li><li>Atomic swaps: Leveraging HTLCs, atomic swaps could be used for general purposes.</li><li>coreBTC improvements: Integrating coreBTC with Core Chain’s Satoshi Plus consensus and using multisig wallets can increase the security of the asset. Additionally, Lockers could be given more collateral options.</li><li>coreBTC as a gas token: This would allow users to pay for transaction fees in either CORE or coreBTC and would enable users to interact with the ecosystem without using any other asset than BTC.</li><li>Bitcoin LST: This would allow BTC stakers to earn yield on their BTC while also using that BTC for various applications on Core Chain.</li><li>Restaking: This would enable other protocols to benefit from Core Chain’s Bitcoin protection.</li></ul><h2>Closing Summary</h2><p>The number of Bitcoin layers has exploded over the past six months, with renewed optimism for Bitcoin programmability. Core Foundation was one of several teams already building in the Bitcoin ecosystem for years, finding themselves greatly positioned to capitalize on the momentum of Bitcoin layers.</p><p>Core Chain is a scaling and programmability solution for Bitcoin that is differentiated by its Satoshi Plus consensus, EVM execution environment, Core DAO governance, and coreBTC bridge. The Core Chain community is building an ecosystem of Bitcoin-focused applications, leveraging Bitcoin security wherever possible along the way. In the coming months, Core Chain plans to iterate towards its governance role and catalyze more ecosystem development with incentives programs.</p></div>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章探讨了意图驱动交易的前景，为用户提供增强的互操作性、全球流动性访问和MEV捕获。尽管以太坊协议已经采纳了意图驱动架构，但它们存在于孤立的系统中，强调了最大化意图系统优势的需要。虽然意图架构协议不断发展，但中心化拍卖预计会持续存在，直到去中心化设计出现。此外，转向基于意图的系统引入了替代的货币化途径，赋予意图架构层和用户重要的定价权，预计市场机会达220亿美元，意图架构层由于其适度的定价权和交易量聚合能力而成为主要受益者。 <div>
<p>Explore the promising realm of intent-based transactions, offering users enhanced interoperability, global liquidity access, and MEV capture. While Ethereum protocols have embraced intent-based architectures, their existence within siloed systems underscores the need for a new approach to maximize intent system benefits. Despite ongoing development of intent architecture protocols, centralized auctions are expected to persist until decentralized designs emerge. Additionally, the transition to intent-based systems introduces alternative monetization avenues, empowering intent architecture layers and users with significant pricing power, while presenting a $22 billion market opportunity across spot trading, perpetual protocols, and bridging verticals, with intent architecture layers poised as the primary beneficiary due to their moderate pricing power and volume aggregation capabilities.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。最近比特币生态系统的发展，如Ordinals、Inscriptions的激增以及BitVM的引入，反映出向Layer 2解决方案增强比特币功能的趋势。尽管存在挑战和保守升级方法，像巴比伦和BitVM这样的举措旨在拓宽比特币的实用性，可能重塑其在区块链领域的角色。虽然比特币的Layer 2生态系统在某些方面落后于其他生态系统，但战略合作伙伴关系和专注于扩大用例显示了比特币演变成为共享安全性和创新的中心的潜力。 <div>
<p>Recent developments in the Bitcoin ecosystem, such as the surge in Ordinals, Inscriptions, and the introduction of BitVM, reflect a shift towards enhancing Bitcoin's functionality with Layer 2 solutions. Despite challenges and a conservative upgrade approach, initiatives like Babylon and BitVM aim to broaden Bitcoin's utility, potentially reshaping its role in the blockchain landscape. While Bitcoin's Layer 2 ecosystem may lag behind other ecosystems in some aspects, strategic partnerships and a focus on expanding use cases demonstrate the potential for Bitcoin to evolve into a centralized hub for shared security and innovation.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章深入探讨了memecoin在加密市场循环中的作用，强调其可预测的行为和爆炸性回报。它将memecoin定位为传统观念之外的后期投机资产，探讨了基于启发式的投资策略明显优于基于市值加权的智能合约平台。通过跟踪memecoin市值阈值，该策略在memecoin、智能合约和现金之间分配资金，展示了显著的回报。然而，文章也承认memecoin领域的不断发展，增加了其流行性，挑战了历史模式的可预测性，并强调memecoin投资的灵活性的必要性。 <div>
<p>The article delves into the role of memecoins in the crypto market cycles, emphasizing their predictable behavior and explosive returns. Highlighting memecoins' position as a later-stage speculative asset beyond traditional sensibilities, it explores a heuristic-based investment strategy outperforming market-cap-weighted smart contract platforms significantly. By tracking memecoin market cap thresholds, the strategy shifts allocations between memecoins, smart contracts, and cash, showcasing remarkable returns. However, the article also acknowledges the evolving landscape of memecoins, with increased popularity challenging the predictability of historical patterns and emphasizing the necessity for adaptability in memecoin investments.</p>

The SaucerSwap DEX utilizes an automated market-making (<a href="https://docs.saucerswap.finance/get-started/faq#what-is-an-amm">AMM</a>) architecture where token-based liquidity pools facilitate liquidity for trades. SaucerSwap consists of two different protocols: SaucerSwap V1 and V2.</p><p><strong>SaucerSwap V1</strong></p><p><a href="https://docs.saucerswap.finance/protocol/saucerswap-v1">SaucerSwap V1</a> is an AMM <a href="https://www.saucerswap.finance/whitepaper.pdf">forked</a> from Uniswap V2 and modified to interact with the Hedera Token Service (<a href="https://hedera.com/token-service">HTS</a>) through the Hedera Smart Contract Service (<a href="https://hedera.com/smart-contract">HSCS</a>). Uniswap V2-based AMMs are liquidity pools that consist of two cryptoassets. As the two cryptoassets enter and leave the pool, the price of the assets against one another constantly rebalances. </p><p>This price is determined by the formula: </p><p><em>x * y = k</em></p><p>“<em>x</em>”<em> </em>and “<em>y</em>”<em> </em>signify tokens in a liquidity pool, and “<em>k</em>” is the product of the token reserves. </p><p>All swaps routed through V1 liquidity pools <a href="https://docs.saucerswap.finance/protocol/saucerswap-v1">incur</a> a 0.3% fee. Then, ⅚ of the fee is directed towards the pool’s liquidity providers pro-rata, and the remaining ⅙ is directed to the protocol.</p><p>Upon depositing assets into a V1 liquidity pool, users <a href="https://docs.saucerswap.finance/protocol/saucerswap-v1#yield-farm">receive</a> liquidity pool tokens in return. These LP tokens can then be <a href="https://docs.saucerswap.finance/protocol/saucerswap-v1#yield-farm">staked</a> to earn yield farming rewards in both HBAR and SAUCE. Rewards emissions are <a href="https://docs.saucerswap.finance/governance/overview#saucerswap-dao">determined</a> by SaucerSwap DAO.&nbsp; </p><p><strong>SaucerSwap V2</strong></p><p><a href="https://docs.saucerswap.finance/protocol/saucerswap-v2">SaucerSwap V2</a> is a concentrated liquidity AMM <a href="https://docs.saucerswap.finance/protocol/saucerswap-v2#core-concepts">forked</a> from Uniswap V3 and modified to interact with the Hedera Token Service (<a href="https://hedera.com/token-service">HTS</a>) through the Hedera Smart Contract Service (<a href="https://hedera.com/smart-contract">HSCS</a>). Concentrated liquidity AMMs aim to improve various inefficiencies of traditional V2 AMMs. For AMMs that use the “(<em>x)(y) = k</em>” formula, the AMM provides liquidity at all price points from zero to infinity. This ensures that liquidity can be provided at every possible price point, but it also creates inefficiencies as less liquidity is provided at each given price point.</p><p>For example, assuming the price of HBAR is $0.10, a traditional AMM provides the same amount of liquidity at “HBAR = $0.01” or “HBAR = $1.00 million,” despite X only being $100.00. Since the likelihood of X increasing or decreasing 100x in a short period is very low, a large portion of the liquidity goes unused.</p><p>The concentrated liquidity model innovates upon this by allowing users to <a href="https://docs.saucerswap.finance/protocol/saucerswap-v2#concentrated-liquidity">choose</a> which prices to provide liquidity at through price ranges. V2 liquidity positions only <a href="https://docs.saucerswap.finance/protocol/saucerswap-v2#concentrated-liquidity">provide</a> liquidity, based on the formula <em>“(x)(y) = k,” </em>within the boundaries designated by a user’s chosen price range. </p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/3dcc725df805552642e22bec18000ea8557b9604-1345x497.png?w=800" /><p><em>Source: </em><a href="https://uniswap.org/whitepaper-v3.pdf">Uniswap V3 Core Whitepaper</a></p><p>Swaps routed through V2 liquidity pools <a href="https://docs.saucerswap.finance/protocol/saucerswap-v2#fee-tiers">incur</a> a fee ranging from 0.05% to 1%, depending on the liquidity pool.

As of writing, Stader is the only provider of liquid staking on the Hedera network. Users can <a href="https://www.staderlabs.com/hedera/">stake</a> HBAR with Stader and receive <a href="https://www.staderlabs.com/docs-v1/hedera/HBARX">HBARX</a> in return. HBARX is a liquid staking token that <a href="https://www.staderlabs.com/docs-v1/hedera/HBARX#what-is-hbarx">represents</a> a user’s share of Stader’s staking pool. This approach allows users to access the benefits of staking without having to indefinitely lock up token holdings.</p><p>Additionally, HBARX rebases to reflect accumulated staking rewards. As such, the exchange rate between HBAR and HBARX increases as Stader accumulates staking rewards. Furthermore, Stader charges a 10% fee on staking rewards to cover the costs associated with operating the staking service.

Additionally, the TVL denominated in HBAR also increased to 1.4 billion, an increase of 89% YTD. This suggests that Hedera’s TVL increase was not only driven by an increase in the price of HBAR (+24% YTD) but also by capital inflows.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/29fab6bfe556ea678b8ba31c12ba29a0f2bf9843-720x405.png?w=800" /><p>Furthermore, SaucerSwap has further solidified its dominance within the Hedera network ecosystem, increasing its TVL YTD from $60.4 million to $143.8 million (+138% YTD) and accounting for 98% of the network's total TVL. SaucerSwap's <a href="https://medium.com/@SaucerSwap/saucerswap-v2-launch-details-f6d4244e27c7">launch</a> of SaucerSwap V2 in November brought new features and improvements, including concentrated liquidity, MetaMask support, Tokenomics V2, and the Liquidity-Aligned Reward Initiative (LARI). As for Heliswap and Pangolin, their respective TVLs have decreased by 18% and 4% YTD.</p><p>DeFi Diversity measures the number of protocols that constitute the top 90% of DeFi TVL. A greater distribution of TVL across protocols reduces the risk of widespread ecosystem contagion resulting from adverse events like exploits or protocol migrations. Due to the dominance of SaucerSwap, Hedera’s DeFi diversity remains at 1.</p><h3>Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs)</h3><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/2db30b0a0d07876f949d9540578cad0459932049-720x405.png?w=800" /><p>DEX volumes on Hedera continue hitting new highs in 2024, after setting an all-time high in Q4 of 2023. Led by SaucerSwap, daily average DEX volume is up to $5.2 million. This is 308% higher than Q4’s daily average DEX volume of $1.3 million. Throughout 2024, SaucerSwap has accounted for 99% of DEX volume on Hedera.</p><h4>SaucerSwap</h4><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/b1410a4d1825aad516f8c2257f005969c257cf24-720x405.png?w=800" /><p>On November 17, 2023, SaucerSwap V2 was <a href="https://medium.com/@SaucerSwap/saucerswap-v2-launch-details-f6d4244e27c7">launched</a>. Upgrades and changes included:</p><ul><li><strong>Concentrated Liquidity Pools</strong> - As previously mentioned, SaucerSwap V2 includes concentrated liquidity pools. This enables 4,000x more capital efficiency as opposed to SaucerSwap V1.</li><li><strong>Revamped Web-App</strong> - A completely re-desgined web app to interact with the protocol and both V1 and V2 pools.</li><li><strong>MetaMask Support</strong> - Full integration with MetaMask to allow any user with a MetaMask wallet to interact with the protocol.</li><li><strong>Update Tokenomics Model</strong> - A 60% reduction in SAUCE token inflation to 126.84 SAUCE per minute accordingly:<ul><li>V1 Yield Farms - 59.82 SAUCE per minute</li><li>DAO + LARI - 55.49 SAUCE per minute</li><li>Developers - 11.53 SAUCE per minute</li></ul></li><li><strong>Liquidity-Aligned Reward Initiative (LARI)</strong> - SAUCE token rewards for V2 liquidity providers. </li></ul><p>The success of V2 is reflected in both SaucerSwap’s TVL and the price of SAUCE. On November 17, 2023, SaucerSwap TVL was $36.2 million. By the end of December, TVL had nearly doubled to $62.4 million, and by the end of February, TVL was $149.9 million, a 314% increase since SaucerSwap V2 went live. Similarly, the price of SAUCE also increased after V2. By the end of February, SAUCE was $0.21, an 824% increase from its November 17 price of $0.02.</p><p>The V1 pools with the highest <a href="https://www.saucerswap.finance/liquidity">liquidity</a> include:</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.saucerswap.finance/liquidity/0.0.1463739">HBARX/HBAR</a> - $21.8 million</li><li><a href="https://www.saucerswap.finance/liquidity/0.0.1461945">SAUCE/HBAR</a> - $15.1 million</li><li><a href="https://www.saucerswap.finance/liquidity/0.0.1465865">SAUCE/xSAUCE</a> - $5.3 million</li><li><a href="https://www.saucerswap.finance/liquidity/0.0.1462797">USDC/HBAR</a> - $2.6 million</li><li><a href="https://www.saucerswap.finance/liquidity/0.0.1465211">HBAR/xSAUCE</a> - $2.4 million</li></ol><p>The V2 pools with the highest liquidity include:</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.saucerswap.finance/liquidity/0.0.3964790">SAUCE/xSAUCE</a> - $7.1 million</li><li><a href="https://www.saucerswap.finance/liquidity/0.0.3961531">HBARX/HBAR</a> - $3.8 million</li><li><a href="https://www.saucerswap.finance/liquidity/0.0.3951117">SAUCE/HBAR</a> - $2.9 million</li><li><a href="https://www.saucerswap.finance/liquidity/0.0.3964804">USDC/HBAR</a> - $1.4 million</li><li><a href="https://www.saucerswap.finance/liquidity/0.0.3948521">USDC/USDC (HTS)</a> - $0.8 million</li></ol><p>These ten pools represent 42% of SaucerSwap’s TVL. However, with the addition of concentrated liquidity, the absolute number of TVL does not necessarily dictate the liquidity of a DEX. An additional way to measure liquidity is through price impact on swaps. As of writing, a $100,000 swap of HBAR (769,946 HBAR) to USDC has a price impact of -2.47%. As for SAUCE, a $100,000 swap of SAUCE (521,342 SAUCE) to USDC has a price impact of -2.78%.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/a9319e4299591ba5004bbbd02b96c607e848020e-720x405.png?w=800" /><p>The success of V2 can be further explained through SaucerSwap’s DEX volumes, broken down by V1 and V2 volumes. In every month except January, V2 volumes outperformed V1. In December, V2 volumes were over three times higher than V1. However, V2’s best month came in February, when it set a monthly high of $123.3 million in DEX volume.</p><p>By the end of February, 52% of the supply of SAUCE had been staked as xSAUCE. Moreover, the exchange rate between SAUCE and xSAUCE is 1.1362:1, and xSAUCE stakers are receiving an approximate APR of 3.6%.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/6f4e540abf0928cfbb2b89b8cf2f422dee3423df-720x405.png?w=800" /><p>SaucerSwap has seen a healthy increase in both transactions and active addresses in 2024. In 2024, there has been an average of 12,300 daily transactions and 1,600 daily active addresses. Respectively, this is a 235% (3,700 daily transactions) and 186% (600 daily active addresses) increase compared to Q4 of 2023.</p><h3>Stablecoins</h3><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/96690185a6a4dd227dcd5305bb409a63bea21414-720x405.png?w=800" /><p>The only stablecoin that has been natively deployed on the Hedera Network is USDC. USDC has built on its strong Q4 and is up 35% YTD to a market cap of $8.3 million. Furthermore, a significant portion of this USDC is being used in Hedera’s DeFi ecosystem. $3.1 million USDC (37% of Hedera’s USDC supply) is deposited into SaucerSwap liquidity pools. Additionally, <a href="https://hashscan.io/mainnet/token/0.0.1055472">USDT</a> and <a href="https://www.saucerswap.finance/swap/HBAR/0.0.1055477">DAI</a> have each been bridged to Hedera using Hashport. $282,200 USDT and $104,900 DAI have been deposited into SaucerSwap liquidity pools.&nbsp;</p><h3>Liquid Staking</h3><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/7b76098e861f108e84d5f59667fae4774f2edcaa-720x405.png?w=800" /><p>Liquid staking is not included in the TVL figure. Despite this, it remains a relevant metric with growing significance. Stader is the only provider of liquid staking on the Hedera network. Liquid staking TVL in HBAR peaked in Q1 2023 and has been on a gradual decline since. Declines in Liquid staking TVL have continued in 2024 and are down 25% YTD to 338.1 million HBAR. Furthermore, liquid staking as a % of total staked for rewards has been steadily decreasing in 2024, down 25% YTD to 4.5% of all HBAR staked for rewards.</p><h3>Services</h3></div>

Building a well-balanced and diversified portfolio typically requires a significant time investment in order to understand and navigate the crypto world. Instead, many users opt for momentum-based trading strategies, as seen in the recent <a href="https://messari.io/report/memecoin-escape-velocity">memecoin craze</a>. For better or for worse, this style of trading could easily turn into a default for new traders, as opposed to strategies that are more anchored in fundamentals. As a result, this environment of extreme highs and lows can present a challenge for traders seeking to gain exposure to the fast-growing crypto sector. Rather than trying to “find the needle in the haystack,” some investors might prefer John Bogle’s approach of simply “<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/920319-don-t-look-for-the-needle-in-the-haystack-just-buy">buying the haystack</a>” itself.</p><p>The strategy is exceedingly popular in the traditional finance world, with global exchange-traded fund (ETF) assets <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/224579/worldwide-etf-assets-under-management-since-1997/">approaching $10 trillion</a>. This strategy has proven to be favorable for investors, as it allows for building a well-balanced and diversified portfolio without the significant time investment. In the crypto world, there has been significant interest in the recently approved <a href="https://messari.io/report/btc-etf-positioning">Bitcoin ETF</a>, demonstrating plenty of traditional and crypto-native demand for this sort of financial product.</p><p>In an attempt to meet this demand, among others, Cryptex has focused its efforts and developments around a single goal: making untradeable markets tradeable. For those seeking to buy the haystack, Cryptex offers the Total Market Cap (TCAP) token which tracks the entire cryptocurrency market cap. This approach effectively unlocks a previously untradeable market and simplifies the investment process in the complex world of cryptocurrencies. In addition, Cryptex has managed to provide TCAP and other offerings without venture capital money or an initial coin offering. Instead, Cryptex stays true to the crypto ethos by providing unique products that are owned and developed by the DAO and protocol.</p><h2>Background</h2><p>Cryptex (<a href="https://messari.io/project/cryptex">CTX</a>) was launched on April 8, 2021, with the goal of making crypto-native markets tradeable. Unlike many of its peers, Cryptex’s launch did not involve any venture capital money or initial coin offerings and was instead a fair launch. The <a href="https://cryptexfinance.notion.site/Meet-Our-Founders-c714ad85176b4773b1001c5a8e4420e5">story</a> began with co-founder <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/JoeCryptex">Joe Sticco</a>’s vision to create the S&amp;P 500 of crypto. He worked with co-founder <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-matzner-86aa0719">Thomas Matzner</a> to bring the idea to life with the help of Ethereum developer <a href="https://twitter.com/preston_vanloon">Preston Van Loon</a>. Formerly at Google, Van Loon also helped establish Prysmatic Labs and worked on Ethereum's shift to Proof-of-Stake (PoS). Since launching, Cryptex has gone through several iterations, including <a href="https://v1.cryptex.finance/">Cryptex V1</a>, <a href="https://docs.cryptex.finance/v2/overview">Cryptex V2</a>, and <a href="https://docs.cryptex.finance/pi/intro">Cryptex π</a>.</p><p>Cryptex uses Ethereum smart contracts, Perennial derivatives vaults, and Chainlink/Pyth data oracles to provide a unique trading experience for users on the Arbitrum Network. The protocol’s flagship product, the TCAP token, tracks crypto’s total market cap and functions similarly to an index fund. Cryptex offers several other innovative products such as its squared markets or its curated basket funds. Cryptex operates as a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) where decision-making is in the hands of CTX tokenholders. The CTX token came into existence via a fair launch, establishing a foundation of transparency and community-driven governance. CTX tokenholders have the authority to cast votes on a range of governance matters, including the introduction of proposals, the implementation of system upgrades, and the strategic management of the treasury.</p><h2>Technology</h2><p>In its endeavor to enable the trading of previously untradeable markets, Cryptex has gone through several iterations: Cryptex V1, Cryptex V2, and Cryptex π. While the underlying goals remained the same, the means to achieving these ends varied significantly enough to merit a deep dive into the technology.</p><h3>Cryptex V1</h3><p>On April 8, 2021, the Cryptex team launched <a href="https://v1.cryptex.finance/">Cryptex V1</a>. It introduced its inaugural product TCAP, which followed crypto’s total market cap. To track this metric via a price feed mechanism, Cryptex collaborated with Chainlink. Chainlink’s <a href="https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds#price-feeds">Price Feeds</a> aggregated data from four distinct providers and provided the average value onchain for TCAP contracts to access. The Chainlink oracles updated said data based on every 1% change in price. To mint TCAP, Cryptex employed a collateralized debt position (CDP) design. Its users first deposited collateral, such as ETH, DAI, or WBTC, and then received the overcollateralized synthetic asset TCAP in return. The value of TCAP was then a simple, index-fund-like calculation of crypto’s total market cap divided by 10 billion (e.g., at the time of writing, TCAP is worth $259.10, reflecting a total market cap of $2.59 trillion).</p><p>Cryptex Finance encountered some challenges with the CDP design, which was integral to keeping TCAP close to its peg. Due to the oracle and token price's dynamic nature, the peg was difficult to maintain because it depended on market behavior.</p><p>To better engage with its community, Cryptex Finance introduced governance through its governance token <a href="https://messari.io/project/cryptex">CTX</a>. With listings on several exchanges such as Gemini, Holbi, and Coinbase, users were given the ability to vote on protocol upgrades. However, the peg problem still posed a challenge for the platform, leading the team to innovate towards better methods of maintaining the token’s stability. Despite these issues, TCAP still saw about $200 million exchanged in mints and burns during Cryptex V1. The fees generated from burning TCAP (equal to 1%) are all owned by the DAO.<br /></p><h3>Cryptex V2<br /></h3><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/65c1cd59f87b46e11d178b5d7aa8aeb6b81ad251-1829x1164.png?w=800" /><p></p><p>The Cryptex team <a href="https://medium.com/cryptexfinance/cryptex-finance-unveils-cryptex-v2-a-revolution-in-decentralized-perpetual-markets-powered-by-908496702812">launched V2</a> in June 2023. Its most notable change was moving from a CDP design to a perps-based approach that was fully decentralized. In addition to Chainlink oracles, the protocol’s <a href="https://docs.cryptex.finance/v2/architecture/">architecture</a> uses smart contracts on Ethereum, derivatives vaults on Perennial, and additional data oracles from Pyth. These all work together to provide a fully decentralized trading experience for users. Trading on <a href="https://v2.cryptex.finance/">Cryptex V2</a> is facilitated on the Arbitrum Network, which eventually led to an airdrop and <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/cryptexdao.eth/proposal/0xcb4fa1b0c56c7a381b44c7454696d58a2da26436e6af658c0679f8a4faf58a75">additional incentives</a> for V2.</p><p>Under Cryptex V2, the mechanisms behind TCAP are more robust, thanks to being built on the DeFi primitive <a href="https://perennial.finance/">Perennial</a>. The derivatives platform is a peers-to-pool automated market maker (AMM) that creates a two-sided market for traders and liquidity providers (LPs). At oracle price, LPs supply capital (acting as makers), and on the other side, traders can play the role of long/short takers.</p><p>There are two types of liquidity providers: passive, those who contribute to vaults that manage positions with baked-in hedging strategies; and active, those who choose to provide liquidity on one side of the market (long or short). LPs also have access to <a href="https://docs.cryptex.finance/v2/architecture#vaults">vaults</a>, which allow makers to hedge their positions. They use predetermined logic to manage these makers’ positions and then share the fees, profits, and losses with the makers. While these makers provide capital in the protocol, the takers (i.e., users) deposit their collateral to gain leveraged exposure to the Oracle price feeds. Trades are settled continuously with profits and losses distributed among participants according to their respective positions.</p><p>All of these trades are tracked by Perennial's collateral contract, which oversees the collateral deposited by users. Cryptex also utilizes Perennial’s product contracts as the core components holding the logic for the perpetual futures. However, the long and short positions are established as distinct instances of these product contracts.</p><p>Perennial's architecture introduces plenty of capital efficiency, as it directly matches up taker and maker trades. While Perennial does charge a variable <a href="https://docs.perennial.finance/protocol-design/funding-rate">funding rate</a> based on market usage, it is affordable when compared to platforms like GMX. Perennial also ensures that Cryptex trades can be executed with zero slippage since it is glued to oracle price points.<br /></p><h3>Cryptex π</h3><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/f6be799308e915e630404b2076a67e9bbaea4719-1931x1164.png?w=800" /><p></p><p>In the middle of Q4’23, the Cryptex team built upon V2’s features and launched <a href="https://cryptex.finance/blog/2023-11-29-introducing-pi/">Cryptex π</a>. The overall intentions of Cryptex π’s <a href="https://docs.cryptex.finance/pi/architecture">architecture</a> were to further increase capital efficiency and to incorporate more low-latency oracles like Pyth. As a result of these efforts, Cryptex was able to offer several <a href="https://cryptex.finance/#markets">additional markets</a>, including BTC-USD, ETH-USD, and SOL-USD. It also introduced squared markets for BTC and ETH, which allow for leveraged trading. Across <a href="https://cryptex.finance/#markets">these markets</a>, Cryptex has over $12 million in total liquidity and over $1 million in open interest. It incorporated several features and strategies to achieve these goals.</p><h4>Improving Capital Efficiency</h4><p>Rather than matching takers directly with LPs, Cryptex π first matches long takers with short takers and then turns to LPs to handle whatever’s left over. This system allows for a faster and more efficient user experience compared to V2. Also, Cryptex π uses bidirectional markets, e.g., one pool per market, as opposed to V2’s unidirectional market which uses one long and one short pool. On the technical side, Cryptex uses the “multi-invoker” feature. It serves as a smart contract that functions as a gateway to Perennial's smart contracts. Multi-invoker enables users or interfaces to execute several operations within Perennial with just one transaction.</p><p>The latest Cryptex version encourages more usage, which would ultimately improve efficiency, by introducing different order types such as stop losses, market, limits, and take profit. To enable these trades, Cryptex created another user type called “keepers.” In addition to executing these orders, keepers are responsible for verifying that price updates have been written onchain.</p><p>Cryptex π also addresses the potential friction caused by Perennial’s variable funding rate fee. Instead of relying on market usage, Cryptex π’s funding rate is determined by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional%E2%80%93integral%E2%80%93derivative_controller">PID mechanism</a>, which is one of the most well-established methods of employing feedback to establish control in a system.</p><h4>Low-Latency Oracles</h4><p>In addition to the Chainlink Core oracles, Cryptex π allows the protocol to expand and include low-latency oracles. As of writing, it has integrated with Pyth to attain these features. <a href="https://messari.io/report/understanding-pyth-network-a-comprehensive-overview">Pyth</a> is a robust oracle network that offers prices for cryptocurrencies, equities, foreign exchange pairs, ETFs, and commodities. It sources its data from several notable providers, including A few notable providers include Jane Street, Chicago Trading Company (CTC), Binance, and Galaxy. By tapping into this network, the Cryptex team has been able to get one step closer to realizing its goal of making untradeable markets tradeable.</p><h4>Fees</h4><p>Because Cryptex is built on Perennial, it inherits a dynamic fee structure. Perennial charges an exchange fee that varies depending on the <a href="https://docs.perennial.finance/protocol-design/funding-rate#market-skew">market skew</a> of each trade. Perennial levies three types of fees. Settlement fees are applied whenever a position is altered, aimed at offsetting the costs associated with oracle keeper fees. Taker fees are charged when opening or closing long/short positions. And, maker fees are charged when maker positions are opened or closed.</p><p>Cryptex π also introduced an interface fee, which is fixed at 2 basis points. The interface fee acts as compensation for simplifying the smart contract experience for users.</p><h2>Governance</h2><p>The history of Cryptex’s evolution from V1 to V2 to Cryptex π can be followed in the many <a href="https://forum.cryptex.finance/">community discussions</a> and proposals submitted to the Cryptex DAO. The DAO runs off of Cryptex’s native token CTX, which is further detailed in the Tokenomics section. The ability to submit proposals is limited to addresses that hold over 100,000 CTX ($515,000). For a proposal to pass, it then needs at least 400,000 CTX cast within 3 days and a simple majority.</p><p>After passing, the proposals are queued in the Timelock contract. This contract governs adjustments to system parameters, upgrades to logic, and contract modifications through a 'time-delayed, opt-out' mechanism. It uses a minimum of 2 days' notice for any governance action and 30 days for more significant changes like alterations to the risk system. All pending and executed actions are transparently visible on the <a href="https://www.tally.xyz/gov/cryptex">Timelock Dashboard</a>.</p><p>Although Cryptex governance is only on Ethereum Mainnet, the protocol has a bridge from Ethereum Mainnet to the Arbitrum Network through two primary contracts. First, the Arbitrum Message Relayer encodes and conveys proposal data to Arbitrum's delayed inbox, and second, the Arbitrum Message Executor subsequently executes the received calldata on the Arbitrum network.</p><p>The Cryptex DAO has a <a href="https://dune.com/cryptexfinance/cryptex-dao-dashboard">collection of data points</a> that highlight just how involved its community is. For example, the number of delegations is at an <a href="https://dune.com/queries/3046085/5066509">all-time high</a>, showing strong interest in the Crypt Keeper initiative (detailed below). The Cryptex team also stated that its core team doesn’t engage in staking in order to avoid double dipping.</p><h4>Single-Sided Staking</h4><p>CTX tokenholders have access to single-sided staking as another way to participate in Cryptex governance. By staking CTX, participants delegate their voting power to designated DAO representatives, known as Crypt Keepers, while still earning staking rewards. There is a 7-day lockup period during which withdrawals are not permitted. Rewards can be monitored via the Cryptex dApp or on platforms like <a href="http://zapper.fi">Zapper.fi</a>. Cryptex offers step-by-step guides on <a href="https://cryptexfinance.notion.site/How-to-make-yourself-a-Crypt-Keeper-112531ae15c14786abc5739217ca4ae7?pvs=25">how to delegate CTX</a> and <a href="https://cryptexfinance.notion.site/How-to-use-Single-Side-Staking-Delegate-to-Crypt-Keepers-b805429d797f4ed0847504987ce1f6e3?pvs=25">how to become a Crypt Keeper</a>. The single-sided staking program was <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/cryptexdao.eth/proposal/0x0c4f1f30e15cc920cd7851b7c2239379e65749c74b59236fa17b3545e674cb97">extended in November</a> via community vote.</p><h2>Tokenomics</h2><h3>CTX</h3><p>In April 2021, Cryptex <a href="https://medium.com/cryptexfinance/introducing-ctx-governance-powering-the-tcap-protocol-c1b32ce084bc">announced</a> the launch of its governance token, CTX. Tokenholders can use CTX to submit governance proposals, vote on such proposals, or delegate their votes.<br /></p><h4>CTX Distribution</h4><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/ec76a1ac598bd3ceb65cd1f599fbb717eebcea78-1600x868.png?w=800" /><p></p><p>CTX had an initial supply of 10 million tokens, which could inflate at a maximum of 2% per year, depending on the community. Minting new tokens could help in situations like when TCAP vaults are undercollateralized or incentives are needed for product development. The token distribution for CTX was as follows:</p><ul><li>Initial Protocol Incentives (25%)</li><li>Treasury (59.5%)</li><li>Founders (15%)</li><li>Advisors (0.5%)</li></ul><p>There was also an early adopter allocation to kickstart the governance process. Users who owned a vault during the first 14 days of CTX’s launch would be eligible for a portion of the 500,000 CTX allocated towards this initiative.</p><p>CTX currently has a little over <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/tokenholderchart/0x321C2fE4446C7c963dc41Dd58879AF648838f98D">2,000 holders</a>, with the top 100 addresses holding about 60% of the total allocation (excluding the <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x321C2fE4446C7c963dc41Dd58879AF648838f98D?a=0xa54074b2cc0e96a43048d4a68472f7f046ac0da8">Timelock</a> address). In November, the community voted on a <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/cryptexdao.eth/proposal/0x96484dfd692c7ca88a18e8112dc4150240b05b784168706ef018570b478dc82a">retroactive airdrop</a> to further incentivize governance participation. The airdrop was made available for eligible participants to claim in February.<br /></p><h3>TCAP</h3><p></p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/88226c0b94e4380c3df157019c5cbf5c005c957d-2677x1211.png?w=800" /><p></p><p><a href="https://app.cryptex.finance/v2/">TCAP</a> is a synthetic asset that is backed by ETH, DAI, and wBTC. Its price represents the total market cap of crypto divided by 10 billion, likely due to unit bias. Cryptex uses <a href="https://medium.com/cryptexfinance/cryptex-selects-chainlink-to-power-its-flagship-token-tcap-71461e73579f">Chainlink Oracles</a> to aggregate data from four distinct providers (CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, Coinpaprika, and CoinLore), which are used to find the <a href="https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/mcap-usd">average value onchain</a>. To acquire TCAP, users can either perform a swap on Uniswap/Sushi/Cryptex dapp or mint TCAP by locking up their own ETH, DAI, or wBTC. If the users wanted their collateral back, they would simply burn their TCAP. To protect users from malicious activity, the Cryptex DAO can pause the TCAP minting/burning software. As of writing, the community has not voted to use this feature.</p><p>TCAP functions similarly to a traditional index fund, and it offers some of the same benefits. These include more diversification, simplified portfolio management, and reduced costs. For a trader to gain exposure to crypto’s market cap, they would have to invest significant time and resources into understanding the intricacies of every wallet, exchange, and token.</p><p>The Cryptex dapp allows users to take both long and short positions on TCAP and to use up to 20x leverage on these trades. While it is free to mint TCAP, it should be noted that there is a <a href="https://cryptexfinance.notion.site/TCAP-e6a4ab3556254b52ad9b88319daa581e#:~:text=TCAP%20has%20no%20minting%20or%20streaming%20fees.%20Instead%2C%20a%201%25%20burn%20fee%20is%20applied%20to%20all%20transactions%20to%20fund%20Cryptex%20Finance%20DAO%20activities.">1% burn fee</a> associated with the token. Users can also take the maker side of the market by providing <a href="https://app.cryptex.finance/v2/liquidity">liquidity for TCAP trades</a>.</p><h4>Airdrops</h4><p>The Cryptex DAO has received two airdops, both of which ended up bolstering the liquidity of TCAP. In April 2023, the Cryptex team <a href="https://forum.cryptex.finance/t/utilizing-arb-token-allocation-to-incentivize-and-empower-the-cryptex-community/360">announced</a> that Cryptex was granted 75,000 ARB in recognition of its efforts in the DeFi space. The Cryptex team proposed to reinvest these tokens back into the community. Half of the ARB tokens were designated to enhance liquidity for the DAO's TCAP over a 60-day span. The remaining half was set to reward Cryptex V2 traders and a tiered referral system. The <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/cryptexdao.eth/proposal/0xa2445accdd988065ae4f478003c36321be2b9cdee1ddbba9b7ba1dcf1f159b63">vote passed</a>, with 90% in favor of the plan.</p><p>When Cryptex integrated with Pyth in November, Cryptex <a href="https://cryptex.finance/blog/2024-02-07-pyth-retroactive-airdrop/">was airdropped</a> 100,000 PYTH. The protocol subsequently conducted a <a href="https://snapshot.org/#/cryptexdao.eth/proposal/0x2327d7e847060ffb043a00b49d5e997992ebd83994acbd969ec27e144144f6e1">community snapshot vote</a> to decide how to use these tokens. The consensus led to the tokens being allocated to enhance TCAP liquidity.</p><h2>Risks and Challenges</h2><p>While Cryptex has several unique offerings, it has some hurdles to clear before it can claim a significant place in the DeFi space. One of the most notable challenges that Cryptex faces is overcoming a competitive landscape that is filled with larger, more established protocols. There is no shortage of decentralized perp exchanges, such as GMX or Vela. Both exchanges far outpace Cryptex in terms of total volume and users. For reference, GMX has seen <a href="https://dune.com/queries/2827533/4753953">$189.61 billion</a> in total volume compared to Cryptex’s <a href="https://dune.com/queries/2431693/4099226">$8.1 million</a>. For Cryptex to close the gap, it will likely have to establish a defensible moat by offering a unique product and continuing to foster an engaged community. In addition to TCAP and squared markets, Cryptex already has plans to offer baskets that track a curated list of top protocols by sectors (e.g., an AI basket).</p><p>Regarding TCAP itself, there is a fair amount of trust that must be placed in the oracles and their sources to provide accurate and up-to-date data. That said, Cryptex has not experienced any significant issues to date with this oracle dependency. In terms of liquidity, TCAP has been reinforced two times by outside resources through the Arbitrum and Pyth airdrops. While helpful in the short term, airdrops are not a sustainable source of liquidity.</p><p>While all decentralized trading platforms carry some risk, Cryptex faces the additional challenge of being limited by geo-political factors. In some countries like the U.S., there is a lack of clear legislation surrounding DeFi projects. As such, Cryptex’s offerings are only available on certain exchanges and platforms. Recognizing the inherent challenges that come with decentralized trading platforms, the Cryptex team proactively audited their protocol. Three separate audits were conducted regarding Cryptex’s <a href="https://cryptex.finance/Cryptex_-_Final_Report.pdf">vaults</a>, <a href="https://cryptex.finance/Cryptex_-_Staking_Report.pdf">single-sided staking</a>, and <a href="https://cryptex.finance/Cryptex_Finance_-_Artbitrum_Integration_-_Final_Report.pdf">governance bridge</a>.<br /></p><h2>Closing Summary</h2><p>For several years, Cryptex has iterated on its goal of making untradeable markets tradeable on the blockchain, as demonstrated in its flagship product, TCAP. The protocol’s evolution from Cryptex V1 to Cryptex π reflects a commitment to innovation. Its ongoing adaptations have been aimed at enhancing capital efficiency and trading experience on a foundation of decentralized governance. Through CTX governance, Cryptex aims to foster a participatory community, underscored by airdrops and strategic reinvestments to bolster its offerings.</p><p>Nevertheless, Cryptex must contend with formidable competitors and an ever-changing regulatory environment. Both factors pose substantial challenges to its expansion and long-term establishment in the market. The team plans to continue building custom indices and deploy new perpetual markets, as well as eventually expanding to more L2s and networks. Cryptex’s constant innovation, coupled with the engagement of its governance community, will be pivotal in securing a sustainable position in the DeFi space.</p></div>

<title>Understanding Primex Finance: A Comprehensive Overview</title>
<link>https://messari.io/article/understanding-primex-a-comprehensive-overview</link>
<guid>https://messari.io/article/understanding-primex-a-comprehensive-overview</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。Primex V1和V2为无需超额抵押的去中心化交易所（DEXs）上的现货保证金交易提供了强大的平台。通过引入信用桶，管理者和公证人，Primex创造了一个去中心化的生态系统，允许高效管理流动性、风险评估和治理，确保安全而灵活的交易环境。 PMX代币在该生态系统中扮演着重要角色。它既是治理和实用代币，激励参与，并促进各种协议操作，包括管理者奖励和协议费用支付。 V2为Primex带来了更大的愿景，为加密货币引入了去中心化的组合保证金。尽管其创新性方法，Primex的设计仍有依赖和限制，需要依靠去中心化桥梁进行跨链操作，并需要预言机价格通知管理者。Primex将在2024年为当前协议增加更多抵押能力和交易场所。其路线图承诺将更复杂的DeFi操作和保证金提供给链上交易者。 <div>
<div><h2>Introduction to Primex V1</h2><p>Primex V1 enables spot margin trading on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) without the need for over-collateralization. It is a permissionless, smart-contract-operated prime brokerage available on Ethereum, Polygon, and Arbitrum. Primex V1 addresses the challenge of enabling users to trade undercollateralized leveraged spot assets onchain. As the team adds new primitives and assets, Primex could offer portfolio margining on various DeFi positions such as spot, LP, and lending.</p><p><br />Primex was first announced in June of 2021 by Primex Labs out of Estonia. The team raised $5.7 million for a seed round in February 2022, led by CoinFund and Stratos Technologies, with participation from Wintermute, GSR, GoldenTree Asset Management, and others. Primex Labs is led by co-founders Vlad Kostanda and Dmitry Tolok, as well as CTO Alex Marukhnenko and CMO Anton Demenko. In May 2022, the team launched the alpha testnet, with the beta launch on Polygon in October 2023. In Q4’23, Primex expanded to Arbitrum and Ethereum.</p><p><br /></p><h2>The Protocol</h2><p>Primex is building a marketplace where lenders and borrowers can interact. Primex liquidity pools (called credit buckets) offer different parameters and associated risks and rewards for lenders than traditional DEXs or lending protocols. There are different pools for different assets, so lenders can choose to allocate to pools that meet their risk tolerance. Traders are the typical borrowers, and they can access that liquidity by choosing an asset to borrow and a credit bucket that matches their needs.<br /></p><p>There are four key players in the Primex ecosystem:</p><ol><li><strong>Lenders</strong> provide liquidity to the credit buckets. This liquidity is then accessed by traders for leveraged trading. Lenders earn interest from the borrowing fees paid by traders, offering a mechanism for passive income generation.</li><li><strong>Traders</strong> seek to leverage their positions to gain exposure to a wide range of assets listed on DEXs. Rather than receiving borrowed funds directly in their wallets, traders perform their trades through credit bucket contracts. Doing so enables more capital efficiency and ensures that positions can be liquidated efficiently.</li><li><strong>Keepers</strong> are bots that monitor positions and orders to perform various actions such as executing limit orders, closing positions under certain conditions, and liquidating risky positions. Keepers play a crucial role in maintaining the stability and security of the Primex ecosystem.</li><li><strong>Notaries (in future versions)</strong> will be trusted participants responsible for making decisions about parameter updates within the Primex protocol. These parameters can be global, affecting the entire ecosystem, or specific to credit buckets (such as supported pairs, leverages, and interest rates). Notaries will be nominated by the community through a staking process, and both the notaries and their nominators would be rewarded for their successful contributions. The core team will be responsible for these parameter changes at genesis. As the protocol matures and gets battle-tested, this role will decentralize to notaries.</li></ol><p>The smart contract architecture of Primex V1 is designed to facilitate the four key players’ interactions seamlessly. Credit buckets are fundamental smart contracts that include a set of parameters defining pool usage rules, such as supported pairs, leverage options, liquidation rules, interest rates for lenders, and fees for traders. These buckets act as an intermediary between lenders, traders, and other DeFi protocols like DEXs, enabling a decentralized and efficient trading environment.</p><p><br /></p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/6c1f5bbe3256bdc505b9ab1a13f49f5ca53af031-643x272.png?w=800" /><p>Source: <a href="https://docsend.com/view/3hnzsv24nvvzbpac">Primex Whitepaper</a></p><p><br />Credit buckets enable a mechanism of leveraging liquidity for trading while maintaining a controlled environment for risk management. The product is key to Primex V1 facilitating leveraged spot trading in a decentralized manner.</p><p></p><p>Primex differentiates itself from perp DEXs by giving exposure to spot instead of synthetic assets. With this mechanism, collateral only needs to be sufficient to cover losses, not capital at risk. As with perp DEXs, Primex users post collateral on the DEX and can have leveraged exposure. If the losses become greater than the collateral, then their positions would get liquidated and they would lose their collateral. Users can tap into their margin to access DEX liquidity instead of relying on market makers or LP collateral.</p><p></p><p>For instance, imagine a user had 1 ETH worth $3,000 and wanted to buy UNI. Using Primex, she could combine her assets with liquidity deposited by lenders to get an undercollateralized loan. If she borrowed $6,000 in ETH she could buy $9,000 worth of UNI on Uniswap (using her $3,000 and the $6,000 loan from Primex). She would owe interest on the amount borrowed, and she could only use it to buy UNI (assuming those are the rules of the bucket, for this example). If UNI were to fall by 33%, or whatever the liquidation rules of the credit bucket are, she would be liquidated, lose her ETH, and repay the loan. However, if UNI were to rise by 33%, she could sell the UNI for $12,000 in USDC, pay back her $6,000 loan, and take home $3,000 in profit (a 100% return).</p><p></p><p>However, Primex V1 has certain dependencies and limitations. For instance, the protocol's efficiency and flexibility in cross-chain operations are contingent upon the capabilities of decentralized bridges. Additionally, the protocol must rely on keepers for the execution of critical protocol functions. This introduces a layer of complexity, as Primex requires a robust network of bots to ensure the accurate execution of trades and liquidations. Lastly, Primex needs oracles to validate the actions of keepers and protect users from price manipulation. To enforce this, the protocol incorporates the concept of Oracle Tolerance (OT). OT accounts for the maximum price deviation from the oracle price when executing significant asset swaps on DEXs. This parameter is crucial for defining liquidation conditions as well as conditional orders like limits and stops. Primex also recently updated their docs and added the ability to be oracle-agnostic, adding flexibility and enabling new assets. The first oracles added are Chainlink, Pyth, and TWAP oracles from Uniswap v3 pools.</p><h2><br />Vision for Primex V2</h2><p><a href="https://blog.primex.finance/introducing-primex-v2-a-new-era-for-the-protocol-651b7a57656c">Primex V2</a> represents an evolution from its predecessor, Primex V1, marking a transition towards a more comprehensive and versatile platform within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. The vision for Primex V2 is to transform the protocol from a spot margin trading platform into a DeFi-native prime brokerage.</p><p><br /></p><p>Prime brokerage solves the problem of liquidity and capital efficiency for users by offering access to borrowing and trading against a portfolio of assets, rather than just one-to-one. This consolidation allows clients to optimize their investment strategies, leveraging the brokerage's resources to enhance their market position and performance.</p><p><br />One of the core innovations of Primex V2 is the introduction of the portfolio concept, which replaces individual positions as the central element of the protocol. A portfolio in Primex V2 can consist of various types of cryptoassets, DeFi positions, or debt, represented through both fungible assets (like cryptocurrencies and lending LP tokens) and non-fungible assets (such as Uniswap V3 LP position NFTs). This allows for a more flexible and dynamic approach to managing leveraged operations. To protect lenders and manage risks, the portfolio's value and liquidation value are recalculated in real time with price changes of the underlying assets.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, Primex V2 aims to democratize access to leveraged trading by removing constraints that previously limited borrowers to interacting only with pre-integrated protocols. By enabling users to specify contracts and engage with any protocol of their choice, Primex V2 facilitates a more open and versatile trading environment. This approach is somewhat analogous to flash loans, focusing on the repayment of the debt plus fees rather than the specifics of how the liquidity is utilized.</p><p></p><p>An interesting feature of Primex V2 is the ability to create hedged strategies by combining leveraged LP positions with spot margin positions. This allows traders to manage risk more effectively within a single protocol, without the need to rebalance positions across multiple platforms. Moreover, the introduction of flash loan functionality to credit buckets in Primex V2 enables borrowers to take out loans without collateral, provided the funds are repaid within the same transaction. This feature is designed for experienced users who can leverage these loans for arbitrage or other quick trading opportunities.</p><p><br />In summary, Primex V2's vision is to establish a more inclusive, flexible, and secure platform for leveraged trading and financial operations within the DeFi space. By expanding the range of supported assets, introducing innovative features like portfolios to credit buckets, and facilitating universal leveraged interaction with any protocol, Primex V2 might be able to deliver a smart contract-based prime brokerage service.</p><p><br /></p><h2>PMX Token</h2><p>The PMX token serves both as a governance and utility token within the Primex ecosystem. The token has not launched yet, and the protocol currently uses ePMX with restricted transferability. ePMX holders will be able to convert to PMX after the token launch. PMX will primarily be used for keeper incentivization and protocol fee payments. This limited functionality is designed to ensure stability and security as the protocol transitions from its initial launch phase to more stable operations. In the long term, the utility of PMX will expand significantly. It will enable holders to vote on critical protocol decisions, thereby participating in the community governance process. Additionally, PMX will be used to incentivize various participants in the ecosystem, including traders, lenders, and keepers, playing a vital role in the consensus mechanisms for keepers and notaries. This broad range of utilities aims to ensure the active and engaged participation of all stakeholders in the protocol's governance and operations, fostering a decentralized and efficient trading environment.</p><p></p><p>The initial distribution of 1 billion PMX tokens is categorized into community, treasury, team and advisors, strategic investors, and inflation. Specifically, the distribution percentages are as follows:</p><ul><li>35% to the community.<ul><li>30% of which goes to the early users and lenders.</li><li>18% of which goes to the public sale pool.</li><li>9% of which goes to Grants.</li><li>3% of which goes to audits and bug bounties.</li><li>20% of which goes to market making.</li><li>20% to early bucket notaries (18-month lock-up).</li></ul></li><li>11% to the treasury.</li><li>21% to the foundation and advisors (48-month vesting period).</li><li>23% to strategic investors (18-month vesting period).</li><li>10% dedicated to inflation.</li></ul><p><br />In the Primex protocol, fees are paid by traders depending on how they use the protocol. The exact amount of each fee might be dynamic, as details have not been released yet.</p><ul><li><strong>Traders</strong> encounter fees in the following areas:<ul><li><strong>Interest Rate</strong>: This is charged for using lenders' liquidity and is paid in the borrowed asset. It's a direct cost associated with the leverage provided to the Trader for their trading activities.<ul><li><strong>Reserve Fee</strong>: A portion of the Borrowing Fee, which goes to the Reserve in the form of pTokens (the interest-bearing version of the token). This fee contributes to the protocol's risk management and liquidity provision mechanisms.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Protocol Fee</strong>: Pays for protocol usage and keepers’ job, which can be settled in either the chain's native token (such as ETH) or in PMX, and is collected and stored in the Treasury. This fee is assessed once when a position is opened and depends on the total asset amount (the borrowed asset plus the deposit) without relying on the time during which this asset is being utilized. The total protocol fee will not exceed 0.3%, with a target value of 0.15% with protocol volume growth. The team has announced the update of the fee model splitting this fee in the following way:<ul><li><strong>Protocol Usage Fee</strong>: Paid for protocol usage, can be settled in either the position asset or in PMX. This fee is assessed when a position is closed as a percentage of the total position size. This enables traders to generate higher returns from small positions as the value of their positions is not reduced by the size of the fees from the outset, offering greater potential for growth.</li><li><strong>Condition Action Fee</strong>: If traders use a condition order like limit buys or stop-loss selling, they must pay a fee to keepers for their services. This makes fees more fair as traders only pay for services they use.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Lenders</strong> are subject to:<ul><li><strong>Withdrawal Fee</strong>: Charged when they withdraw liquidity from buckets, calculated as a percentage of the funds they withdraw. This fee is part of the protocol's mechanism to manage liquidity efficiently and ensure stability within the credit buckets.</li></ul></li></ul><p>These fees are collected and stored in the Treasury. The Reserve and Treasury periodically exchange accumulated fees to PMX or other necessary tokens, which are then distributed to keepers as needed. This mechanism ensures that the PMX token plays a central role in the protocol's economic activities, incentivizing participation and contributing to the protocol's sustainability.</p><p><br /></p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Primex V1 and V2 present a robust platform for spot margin trading on DEXs without the need for overcollateralization. Through the introduction of credit buckets, keepers, and notaries, Primex creates a decentralized ecosystem that allows for efficient liquidity management, risk assessment, and governance, ensuring a secure and flexible trading environment. The PMX token plays a central role in this ecosystem. It serves as both a governance and utility token, incentivizes participation, and facilitates various protocol operations, including keeper rewards and protocol fee payments. V2 brings an even bigger vision for Primex, introducing decentralized portfolio margining to crypto. </p><p>Despite its innovative approach, Primex's design has dependencies and limitations. For example, it must rely on decentralized bridges for cross-chain operations and needs oracle prices to inform keepers. Primex will be adding more collateral capabilities and trading venues to the current protocol in 2024. Its roadmap promises more complex DeFi actions and margin to be made available to onchain traders.</p></div>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。本周SEC在多个方面遭遇挑战。一方面，一家加密公司因SEC对其提出虚假指控而获得法院制裁。另一方面，共和党人批评SEC主席的强硬立法和未能明确规定数字资产规则。与此同时，SEC表示需要更多资金来履行其使命，提及市场增长、变化和加密市场的"狂野西部"。议员们表示稳定币立法仍然存在，但找到一个立法载体至关重要。 <div>
<p>It was a busy week for the SEC. A federal district court sanctioned the agency for making multiple misleading claims to secure a temporary restraining order against a crypto firm. At an SEC oversight hearing, Republicans criticized the Chair's aggressive rulemaking and failure to provide clear rules for digital assets. Meanwhile, the SEC said it needed more funding to fulfill its mission, citing market growth, market changes, and the "Wild West of the crypto markets." House Financial Services Chair Patrick McHenry and Senator Cynthia Lummis say stablecoin legislation is still alive, but finding a legislative vehicle remains key.</p>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。Marinade Finance 是 Solana 上的一个自动化质押协议，提供了流动性和本地质押解决方案。Marinade 拥有超过18亿美元的 TVL。Marinade Native 快速增长，吸引了6.3亿美元的 TVL。未来计划包括推出保护性质押奖励和更新的委派策略。Marinade 还启动了 Marinade Earn 活动，奖励质押者和委派管理员。尽管有些批评，Marinade 在 Solana 生态系统中处于领先地位，并继续扩展其协议。<br /> <div>
<div><h2><strong>Key Insights</strong></h2><ul><li><strong>Marinade Finance is an automated staking protocol on Solana that provides liquid and native staking solutions.</strong></li><li><strong>Marinade has over $1.8 billion in TVL.</strong> At $1.2 billion, Marinade Liquid recently lost its place as Solana’s top liquid staking protocol to Jito.

As stakers are incentivized to delegate to high-performing and “safer” validators, stake may begin concentrating at the top.</p><p>Marinade Finance is an automated staking protocol on Solana, offering liquid and native staking solutions. By delegating stake to over 100 top-performing validators, Marinade aids in decentralizing the Solana validator set without harming staker APY. Between its liquid and native products, Marinade has over $1.8 billion in TVL. Marinade plans to delegate to even more validators once it introduces Protected Staking Rewards and the upcoming delegation strategy update, all while preserving its APY.</p><h2><strong>Background</strong></h2><p>Marinade was <a href="https://marinade.finance/blog/the-first-liquid-staking-solution-on-solana/">founded</a> during the March 2021 Solana x Serum Hackathon, winning the 3rd place prize of around <a href="https://marinade.finance/blog/state-of-marinade-in-the-wake-of-ftx-alameda/">$80,000</a>. After the hackathon, the Marinade team connected with <a href="https://twitter.com/lucio_tato">Lucio Tato</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/mbroeken">Marco Broeken</a>, who also submitted a liquid staking solution for the same hackathon. The two teams ultimately decided to <a href="https://marinade.finance/blog/stronger-together/">work together</a> under the Marinade brand.</p><p>After a <a href="https://marinade.finance/blog/liquid-staking-on-solana/">devnet launch</a> on Solana in May 2021, Marinade launched on <a href="https://marinade.finance/blog/what-a-launch/">mainnet</a> on August 2, 2021. A few months later, Marinade’s governance token MNDE was <a href="https://marinade.finance/blog/mnde-launch-serving-the-tastiest-token/">released</a>, with a retroactive airdrop for holders of Marinade SOL (mSOL). In April 2022, Marinade’s onchain governance <a href="https://marinade.finance/blog/let-marinades-on-chain-governance-begin/">launched</a>, which later migrated to governance platform <a href="https://app.realms.today/dao/MNDE">Realms</a> in July 2023.</p><p>Marinade has not raised any venture capital funding or conducted any public token sales. Instead, Marinade’s native token MNDE has mainly been distributed via various campaigns to reward users and contributors, detailed in the Tokenomics section below.</p><p>Marinade’s liquid staking protocol has undergone several updates since its launch, including new delegation strategies and <a href="https://marinade.finance/blog/introducing-protected-staking-rewards/">Protected Staking Rewards</a>. Marinade launched a native staking product, <a href="https://medium.com/marinade-finance/introducing-marinade-native-fdb641d98e64">Marinade Native</a>, in July 2023 to counterpart its liquid staking solution.</p><h2><strong>Technology</strong></h2><h3><strong>Marinade Liquid</strong></h3><p>Marinade’s original product is its liquid staking protocol. The protocol enables users to deposit SOL and receive a token receipt as mSOL. The deposited SOL is staked to validators according to Marinade’s Delegation Strategy, described below. As staking rewards accrue to the underlying staked SOL pools, mSOL appreciates relative to SOL over time.</p><p>Compared to native staking on Solana, liquid staking offers several advantages, including:</p><ul><li>No Opportunity Cost: SOL holders can opt out of dilution from inflation (currently 5.4% annualized inflation) while still partaking in other opportunities, such as DeFi.</li><li>No Unbonding Period: Natively staked tokens cannot be withdrawn until the epoch's end (every 2-3 days). Liquid stakers, however, can immediately swap from mSOL to SOL, assuming enough liquidity.</li><li>Stake Distribution and Management: When staking natively, it might be cumbersome to distribute stake across many validators. Furthermore, the average staker does not have the tools to monitor validators and automatically re-delegate in case of commission rugs, validator downtimes, or other performance issues. Marinade Liquid does all of this for stakers, aiding in both the decentralization of Solana’s validator network and the return to stakers.</li><li>Potential Tax Benefits: Depending on the tax jurisdiction, liquid staking can present the advantage of its rewards being taxed as capital gains rather than income.</li></ul><p>While liquid staking introduces several benefits, it also brings some smart contract risk. Users must place some trust in the contract that stores deposited SOL and mints mSOL. If it has a vulnerability, a malicious actor could steal the SOL or mint mSOL out of thin air. To that end, Marinade’s smart contracts were audited in 2021 by <a href="https://marinade.finance/docs/KudelskiSecurity.pdf">Kudelski Security</a> and <a href="https://marinade.finance/docs/AckeeBlockchain.pdf">Ackee Blockchain</a>, with audits on upgraded contracts in 2023 by <a href="https://marinade.finance/docs/Neodyme_2023.pdf">Neodyme</a> and <a href="https://marinade.finance/docs/Sec3_2023.pdf">Sec3</a>.</p><p>The primary fee involved in Marinade Liquid is a 6% fee on rewards. Based on a 7% APY, this translates to around a 0.42% fee on staked SOL. There is no deposit fee or unstake fee if a user waits for the epoch to end. If a user wants to instantly unstake, the fee ranges from 0.1% to 9% based on a <a href="https://docs.marinade.finance/marinade-protocol/system-overview/unstake-liquidity-pool">formula</a> that tracks the liquidity in a protocol-owned mSOL/SOL pool. Half of the fees go to the liquidity providers, and the other half go to Marinade’s treasury. On Marinade’s UI, the DEX aggregator Jupiter is used for instant unstaking, which sources liquidity from Marinade’s protocol-owned pool and mSOL/SOL pools in various third-party DeFi protocols.</p><p>The liquidity pool at its steady state is designed to contain 100% SOL (liquidity providers can only deposit SOL, not mSOL). If mSOL is deposited via an instant unstake order, the Marinade protocol rebalances the pool back to 100% SOL by using that mSOL as the next mSOL provided for a stake operation. The new staker’s SOL would then go to the liquidity pool at no cost to the user. Besides instant unstake orders, the liquidity pool is used for mSOL liquidations and to match staking and unstaking orders.</p><h3><strong>Marinade Native</strong></h3><p>In July 2023, Marinade <a href="https://marinade.finance/blog/introducing-marinade-native/">introduced</a> Marinade Native, a native staking product in conjunction with its liquid staking product. Marinade Native stakes SOL to Solana validators using the same delegations strategy as Marinade Liquid, described below.</p><p>Rather than receiving mSOL, Marinade Native stakers receive SOL rewards sent to their stake accounts every epoch. Furthermore, Marinade Native stakers retain custody of their SOL and are not introduced to any smart contract risk. Under Solana’s stake account structure, every account has a stake authority and a withdraw authority. Marinade Native receives stake authority but has no access to withdraw authority. Users can revoke Marinade Native’s stake authority access at any time.</p><p>Marinade Native has no management fee, unlike the 6% Marinade Liquid fee on rewards. Like Marinade Liquid, Marinade Native does not have a fee on deposits; however, it does have a fixed 0.001 SOL fee on all withdrawals.</p><p>Marinade Native introduces the same “Stake Distribution and Management” benefit as Marinade Liquid. It allows stakers to easily distribute their stake across top-performing validators while enjoying virtually the same qualities as native staking.</p><h3><strong>Delegation Strategy</strong></h3><p>SOL deposited in Marinade Liquid and Native are staked to validators based on the following criteria:</p><ul><li>60% – Marinade’s Algorithmic Delegation Strategy<ul><li>Marinade considers all active validators every epoch and gives <a href="https://github.com/marinade-finance/delegation-strategy-pipeline">scores</a> to eligible ones.<ul><li>Eligible validators have at least 10 epochs of data (roughly a month), a maximum of 10% commission in the past 10 epochs, and a minimum stake of at least 1,000 SOL.</li><li>Eligible validators are then <a href="https://docs.marinade.finance/marinade-protocol/validators#performance-based-score">scored</a> based on their commission-adjusted APY, percentage of blocks produced out of leader slots assigned, and decentralization based on data centers.</li></ul></li><li>Marinade’s stake is then distributed to the top 100 validators based on their scores. This operation is managed by a set of permissionless bots (anyone can run them).</li><li>Validators can also get blacklisted if they display vote lagging, commission rugs (e.g., raising commission to 100%), or twice fail to restart their node in 36 hours following a cluster restart after a blockchain halt. Blacklisted validators can appeal or demonstrate reformed behavior and be removed, but repeat offenders or one-time commission rug offenders are permanently blacklisted.</li></ul></li><li>20% – MNDE Directed Stake<ul><li>MNDE stakers can vote on validators, with 20% of Marinade TVL staked to validators proportionally based on the votes.</li><li>Validator eligibility rules are the same as the Marinade delegation strategy except<ul><li>The minimum stake is 100 instead of 1,000 SOL</li><li>Instead of being in the top 100 scores, the validator’s score must be at least 90% of the lowest-scored validator picked by the delegation strategy.</li></ul></li><li>Votes for a single validator are capped at 10% of total votes. If a validator receives more than 10% of the total votes, the overflow votes are distributed to other validators proportionally based on their votes or to validators picked by the delegation strategy if fewer than 10 eligible validators are voted for.</li></ul></li><li>20% – mSOL Directed Stake<ul><li>mSOL holders can vote on validators, with 20% of Marinade TVL staked to validators proportionally based on the votes. Users can vote with mSOL even if it’s deposited in select DeFi protocols.</li><li>Validator eligibility rules are the same as the Marinade delegation strategy except<ul><li>There are no minimum stake requirements</li><li>Instead of being in the top 100 scores, the validator’s score must be at least 80% of the lowest-scored validator picked by the delegation strategy.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>The above delegation strategy has been in effect since the March 2023 delegation strategy <a href="https://marinade.finance/blog/introducing-new-and-improved-delegation-formula/">update</a>. Another <a href="https://forum.marinade.finance/t/delegation-strategy-updates-finally/851">update</a> is in the works, which was recently <a href="https://app.realms.today/dao/MNDE/proposal/UbwXpefrUjrECWnbqHMA1z3c3UbCYBGkHVLhS7jcbUx">approved</a> via governance. Notable changes include:</p><ul><li>In addition to the hosting data center, decentralization scores will include overall stake distribution, hosting country, and hosting city. Accounting for overall stake distribution will improve Solana’s Nakamoto coefficient by delegating more stake to smaller validators.</li><li>As Marinade’s TVL grows, the number of validators receiving stake via the algorithmic delegation strategy can increase above 100.</li><li>MNDE and mSOL holders can allocate votes toward the algorithmic stake instead of only specific validators.</li><li>The maximum commission for eligible validators will be reduced from 10% to 8%.</li></ul><p><strong>Protected Staking Rewards</strong></p><p>In mid-February 2024, Marinade began the launch of <a href="https://marinade.finance/blog/introducing-protected-staking-rewards/">Protected Staking Rewards</a> (PSR). <a href="https://medium.com/marinade-finance/protected-staking-rewards-and-delegation-strategy-updates-098a23f8a851">PSR</a> enforces an onchain service-level agreement protecting stakers from reduced rewards for reasons such as validator performance issues or commission rugs. PSR requires validators to put up a bond to be eligible for Marinade stake. The required bond amount will equal 1 SOL for every 10,000 SOL received from Marinade delegation. The Marinade DAO will also commit 4 SOL for every 10,000 SOL delegated. Validator bonds will cover initial losses, with Marinade’s bond covering extended losses. As such, PSR allows Marinade to stake to more validators without sacrificing APY to stakers.</p><p>By February 15, validators needed to set up their bond to be eligible for stake, although the bond did not yet need to be funded. Over 330 validators have set up their bond so far. Neodyme is currently auditing the validator bonds contract. Once the audit is completed, Marinade will implement the governance <a href="https://app.realms.today/dao/MNDE/proposal/9j921vMYNm4LbUBL75CQr1qkJt2fq6ZLv9xTCS8yXhqw">proposal</a> that was recently passed to formally integrate PSR.</p><h2><strong>Tokenomics</strong></h2><h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3><p>Marinade’s token MNDE is used for governance and growth initiatives. MNDE currently has a capped supply of 1 billion tokens. Around 22.5% of the total supply has been allocated to the team, with the rest going to the DAO. The DAO has allocated tokens toward various initiatives, with around 63% of the total supply still unallocated. At a circulating supply of 257 million, MNDE’s market cap currently stands at over $65 million.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/b5c1f1f3e8b66e20670123a341553e5cd491596b-6400x3688.png?w=800" /><h3><strong>Initial Distribution</strong></h3><p>MNDE launched in November 2021 with a capped supply of 1 billion tokens. Of those tokens, 35% were allocated to the community, 35% to the DAO, and 30% to the Marinade team.</p><h3><strong>Team Token Allocation Changes</strong></h3><p>After a six-month lockup, the team’s tokens began vesting linearly in April 2022. The linear vesting was extended from 2 to 4 years in August 2022. In February 2023, the team <a href="https://marinade.finance/blog/mnde-tokenomics-update-revisiting-incentives/">announced</a> it would be reallocating 225 million MNDE to the DAO (22.5% of the total supply), reducing its allocation to 75 million tokens, 63 million of which had already been unlocked. The remaining 12 million tokens finished vesting in January 2024.</p><p>At the same time, the team announced that subject to governance, 138 million MNDE would be allocated to the team from the DAO. Instead of purely time-based unlocks, this distribution incorporates performance-based elements. At each milestone, 46 million MNDE would be allocated when TVL reaches 8 million, 16 million, and 32 million SOL. For each milestone, the team could request up to 2 million MNDE monthly to cover any operation expenses that outweighed protocol revenue. If the TVL milestones are hit, the rest of the budget will be unlocked with a 12-month vesting schedule.</p><p>In October 2023, Marinade reached the 8 million SOL TVL milestone. Of the 46 million MNDE allocated for this milestone, over 37 million MNDE remained in the operational budget, initiating a 12-month monthly vesting period. Subsequently, another 46 million MNDE was earmarked in anticipation of reaching the next milestone of 16 million SOL TVL.</p><p>Additionally, around 11.6 million MNDE was distributed from the DAO for initial contributor grants.</p><h3><strong>Growth Initiatives</strong></h3><p>Tokens not distributed to the team have been distributed by various initiatives:</p><p><em>Retroactive Rewards (Token Launch)</em>: <em>Distributed 20 million MNDE as a retroactive airdrop.</em></p><p>At launch, 20 million tokens (2% of the total supply) were airdropped as <a href="https://docs.marinade.finance/the-mnde-token/retroactive-rewards">retroactive rewards</a> to mSOL holders, LPs in the Marinade mSOL/SOL pool and other ecosystem integrations, and devnet participants.</p><p><em>Liquidity Mining Rewards (Token Launch - July 2023)</em>: <em>Distributed over 78 million MNDE as liquidity rewards in mSOL DeFi pools.</em></p><p>At launch, 350 million MNDE (35% of total supply) was allocated toward <a href="https://docs.marinade.finance/the-mnde-token/liquidity-mining">liquidity mining</a> at a target rate of around 1.7 million MNDE per week. An additional 80 million MNDE would be allocated as liquidity mining bonuses if several Marinade TVL milestones were reached (starting at 3 million SOL and reaching 100 million SOL).</p><p>Originally, the Marinade team <a href="https://marinade.finance/blog/mnde-launch-serving-the-tastiest-token/">decided</a> what liquidity pools were incentivized and with how much MNDE. In July 2022, a <a href="https://forum.marinade.finance/t/mdao-governance-proposal-liquidity-mining-gauges/190">proposal</a> was <a href="https://tribeca.so/gov/mnde/proposals/7">passed</a> to hand over this decision-making to MNDE holders via governance. Through liquidity gauges on governance platform <a href="https://tribeca.so/gov/mnde/proposals">Tribeca</a>, MNDE holders could vote on which protocols to allocate liquidity mining rewards. Additionally, the proposal implemented a weekly distribution cap of 1 million MNDE.</p><p>Throughout 2022, <a href="https://forum.marinade.finance/t/rethinking-liquidity-mining-gauges/290">discussions</a> about the liquidity mining program often concluded that it was not effectively incentivizing the sticky growth of mSOL TVL in DeFi protocols. This conclusion was reinforced by the fact that Marinade’s TVL was largely flat from Q4’21 until the FTX collapse in Q4’22. After the FTX collapse, DeFi activity on Solana reduced even more.</p><p>Thus, the DAO decided to further reduce emissions from the program. A “do not distribute” gauge was added that sent rewards back to the treasury. Around 77% of the budget was allocated to the “do not distribute” gauge. In January 2023, a <a href="https://forum.marinade.finance/t/reduce-liquidity-mining-weekly-rate-by-75/442/1">proposal</a> was <a href="https://tribeca.so/gov/mnde/proposals/29">passed</a> to reduce weekly rewards to 250,000 MNDE. Over 75% of votes still went to the “do not distribute” gauge, meaning only around 60,000 MNDE were distributed weekly. In July 2023, liquidity mining rewards, including the TVL milestones, were fully paused.</p><p>In total, just over 78 million MNDE were distributed via the liquidity mining program. Of that, 10.5 million came from the first two TVL milestones, which were reached in the first week.</p><p><em>Token Exchange Program (June 2022)</em>: <em>Distributed over 9.8 million MNDE to several DeFi protocols and validators in exchange for 483,000 USDC and 500,000 SLND.</em></p><p>In June 2022, a governance <a href="https://forum.marinade.finance/t/marinade-token-exchange-program/221">proposal</a> was <a href="https://tribeca.so/gov/mnde/proposals/8">passed</a> to execute a token exchange <a href="https://marinade.finance/blog/marinade-dao-executes-token-exchange-program-to-align-with-leading-solana-builders/">program</a> with several DeFi protocols and validators, <a href="https://marinade.finance/blog/marinade-kitchen-stories-june-2022/#:~:text=first%20video%20here-,Marinade%20DAO%20Financial%20Overview%20%E2%80%94%20June%202022,-Marinade%20DAO%20Financial">exchanging</a> 9.8 million MNDE for 483,000 USDC and 500,000 SLND. The exchange program <a href="https://forum.marinade.finance/t/marinade-token-exchange-program/221#what-is-the-rationale-behind-the-proposal-6">aimed</a> to align Marinade with strategic partners, diversify its treasury, and enable selected partners to purchase MNDE at a size that would’ve caused over 30% slippage in the open market. Participating DeFi protocols included Solend, Raydium, Friktion, Port, and Crema. Participating validators included Staking Facilities, Shinobi Systems, Cogent Crypto, Laine (Stakewiz), Blockdaemon, Stakin, and Solana Compass. MNDE was distributed with a 30-day unlocking period.</p><p><em>Open Doors Program (February 2023 - January 2024)</em>:<em> Distributed 1.7 million MNDE to protocols, validators, and individuals based on their contributions to mSOL growth, with another six months of rewards to distribute.</em></p><p>Marinade <a href="https://marinade.finance/blog/introducing-the-open-doors-program/">introduced</a> the <a href="https://marinade.notion.site/marinade/Invitation-Marinade-Open-Doors-program-8eef7e294a7d4b51a5d8aea1fe0ca8b2">Open Doors Program</a> in January 2023. Open Doors was a 12-month program offering up to 160 million MNDE (16% of the total supply) incentives to protocols, validators, and individuals. The program aimed to improve upon the liquidity mining program by rewarding entities retroactively based on their contributions to Marinade’s TVL increase rather than proactively trying to incentivize it.</p><p>The program distributed MNDE to:</p><ul><li><em>Protocols</em> based on their net mSOL TVL increase. The rewards went directly to protocols, leaving it up to them to pass it on to users.</li><li><em>Validators </em>that converted their self-stake to liquid stake and/or received directed stake (once directed stake launched).</li><li><em>Individuals</em> based on how much SOL was staked in Marinade through their referral link via Marinade’s <a href="https://docs.marinade.finance/partnerships/referral-program">referral program</a>.</li></ul><p>Rewards were tracked and distributed on a two-month cycle. The amount distributed in each two-month period equaled Marinade’s average TVL in the period subtracted by its TVL on February 1, 2023, then multiplied by four (giving out rewards at a rate of 4 MNDE per 1 mSOL) and then divided by six (to account for there being six two-month periods). Rewards were distributed back to protocols, validators, and individuals in proportion to their individual net mSOL TVL increase. Around, 2.6 million MNDE was <a href="https://forum.marinade.finance/t/proposal-launch-160m-mnde-open-doors-tvl-program/398/50">distributed</a> for the program.</p><p><em>Marinade Earn (October 2023 - present)</em>: <em>Distributed 9.7 million MNDE to mSOL holders in Season 1, with up to 25 million MNDE eligible for distribution in the ongoing Season 2.</em></p><p>In September 2023, a <a href="https://forum.marinade.finance/t/mdao-proposal-launch-160m-mnde-incentive-campaign-for-msol-marinade-native/529/19">proposal</a> was <a href="https://app.realms.today/dao/MNDE/proposal/EQ8Fua5r1oKGTZPSiJztfE2o8c3WqieTuP9uoGmMjyzs">passed</a> to launch Season 1 of Marinade Earn. Marinade Earn Season 1 distributed 1 MNDE per 1 SOL staked in Marinade Liquid (i.e., mSOL token-holders) or Marinade Native from October 1, 2023, to December 31, 2023. Rewards were pro-rated if a user did not hold mSOL for the entirety of the program. Users would also receive rewards if their mSOL was deposited in <a href="https://marinade.finance/blog/introducing-marinade-earn-season-1/#:~:text=You%20can%20also%20use%20your%20mSOL%20in%20participating%20Snapshot%20protocols%3A%20Solend%2C%20Marginfi%2C%20Raydium%2C%20Orca%2C%20Saber%2C%20Mango%2C%20Drift%2C%20and%20Super%20Stake%20SOL.%20Some%20of%20these%20partners%20may%20also%20be%20offering%20their%20own%20MNDE%20incentives.">select DeFi protocols</a>. In addition, Marinade Earn incentivized Marinade Native referrals, distributing 1 MNDE per 1 SOL staked in Marinade Native via referral links. In total, around 9.7 million MNDE was distributed as Season 1 rewards, which were distributed at the end of the campaign with a 30-day unlocking period.</p><p>After Season 1, a <a href="https://forum.marinade.finance/t/dao-proposal-unlock-a-25m-mnde-budget-for-marinade-earn-season-2/717">proposal</a> was <a href="https://app.realms.today/dao/MNDE/proposal/6SUme3kKLLEsHP21fqJtYVQK2v1QRkR29Lj2vvgXG7B1">passed</a> to launch <a href="https://marinade.finance/blog/let-marinade-earn-season-2-begin/">Season 2</a>, rewarding Marinade stakers from January 1, 2024, to March 31, 2024. Changes from Season 1 include:</p><ul><li>1 MNDE per 2 SOL staked, instead of 1 MNDE per 1 SOL staked.</li><li>No more rewards for Marinade Native referrals, as only around 300,000 MNDE was earned via the Native referral campaign in Season 1.</li><li>Additional bonuses to:<ul><li>MNDE holders locking tokens to direct stake will earn additional incentives based on 2 SOL per 1 MNDE ratio over the three months.</li><li>Validators based on their algorithmic stake score.</li></ul></li><li>Total rewards capped at 25 million MNDE.</li></ul><h3><strong>Governance</strong></h3><p>Beyond growth initiatives, MNDE is also used for Marinade DAO governance. When Marinade’s governance <a href="https://marinade.finance/blog/let-marinades-on-chain-governance-begin/">launched</a> in April 2022, MNDE holders could participate by minting a <a href="https://marinade.finance/blog/marinade-announces-the-launch-of-on-chain-dao-governance-thru-nfts/">Chef NFT</a>, with several tiers based on their amount of MNDE. Marinade governance initially leveraged the governance platform <a href="https://tribeca.so/gov/mnde/proposals">Tribeca</a>. However, in July 2023, Marinade governance migrated to <a href="https://app.realms.today/dao/MNDE">Realms</a>. The Chef NFTs were deprecated in favor of more traditional MNDE-based governance. To participate in governance, voters must lock up MNDE, which is then subject to a 30-day unlocking period.</p><p>Marinade relies on a set of <a href="https://docs.marinade.finance/marinade-protocol/security/multisig-governance">multisigs</a> to enact protocol changes. There is a 6/13 multisig containing parties from various Solana projects that controls contract-code upgrades. There’s also multisig containing five addresses controlled by the Marinade team that controls mSOL-SOL liquidity pool and other parameters. Lastly, Marinade uses a 4/7 multisig containing Marinade team members to control the Marinade Council Budget vault. When Marinade DAO approves budget proposals via governance, MNDE tokens are sent to the vault for distribution.</p><h2><strong>Protocol Usage and Key Metrics</strong></h2><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/539fb722978f46e3052d5a6a872c74befbce1e2e-6400x3472.png?w=800" /><p>Marinade Liquid grew quickly following its launch in August 2021, gaining over 7.3 million SOL in TVL within three months. Marinade Liquid TVL peaked at over 7.7 million SOL in January 2022. Despite the liquidity mining program, Marinade's growth stagnated in 2022, largely due to the end of the previous bull market. The bear market was especially exacerbated on Solana when FTX collapsed in early November. SOL’s price peaked on November 6, 2022, with the overall crypto market cap reaching its all-time high a few days later. DeFi activity on Solana fell notably following FTX’s collapse, reducing the demand for liquid staking solutions. Marinade Liquid’s TVL fell by around 1.3 million SOL in the month following the FTX collapse.</p><p>While Solana DeFi activity and the overall market have picked back up, Marinade Liquid’s TVL is still stagnant at 6.7 million SOL, or $1.2 billion. The lack of recent growth can be attributed to competition from new liquid staking protocols offering points and airdrop programs, detailed below.</p><p>However, Marinade as a whole has witnessed notable growth. Much of the growth has been driven by Marinade Native, whose TVL stands at 3.6 million SOL, or $630 million. Altogether, Marinade’s TVL is at 10.3 million SOL. With SOL’s rapid price appreciation since the beginning of Q4’23, Marinade’s TVL in USD has surged to $1.8 billion.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/47b2ff98cbc90dc9d866619e73e953107098f0de-6400x3596.png?w=800" /><p>Marinade delegates SOL to around 250 validators. <a href="https://dune.com/queries/3230950/5403701">Distribution</a> figures of Marinade’s delegated stake are the following:</p><ul><li>10 validators make up the top 33% of Marinade delegated stake.</li><li>32 validators make up the top 50% of Marinade delegated stake.</li><li>115 validators make up the top 90% of Marinade delegated stake.</li></ul><p>Before the latest delegation strategy <a href="https://forum.marinade.finance/t/mdao-proposal-delegation-strategy-revamp/469">upgrade</a> in March 2023, Marinade delegated to over 450 validators. At the time, around 350 validators were receiving less than 10,000 SOL from Marinade. With the fall in SOL’s price following the FTX collapse, this amount of SOL staked was deemed no longer sufficiently beneficial to validators. Thus, Marinade limited the number of validators in the automated delegation strategy set to 100. As noted above, the planned delegation update aims to increase this limit.</p><p>With the recent uptick in Solana network activity, mSOL APY is up to around 7.4%. For reference, SOL’s annualized inflation rate is at 5.4%. The mSOL APY figure is calculated based on mSOL’s “true price,” i.e., SOL in Marinade staking pool / mSOL minted.</p><p>mSOL’s market price can deviate from its “true price” based on market conditions and available liquidity. An example of this occurred on December 12, 2023, when an address <a href="https://twitter.com/ponzirespecter/status/1734634673051951368">sold</a> around $8 million of mSOL, causing its price to <a href="https://twitter.com/0xMert_/status/1734628374209786169">dip</a> below SOL’s due to insufficient liquidity. Marinade is in the process of integrating with <a href="https://twitter.com/sanctumso">Sanctum</a>, which offers a <a href="https://learn.sanctum.so/docs/docs/our-roadmap">unified liquidity pool</a> and <a href="https://learn.sanctum.so/docs/reserve-pool">reserve</a> for Solana liquid staking protocols.</p><p>LST looping has been a popular strategy to amplify staking yields, although it brings a higher risk. The process involves recursively borrowing the native network token against one of its LSTs. Several emerging protocols enable users to deploy this strategy using mSOL with one click, including <a href="https://www.superstakesol.com/">Super Stake SOL</a>, powered by Drift’s borrow/lend protocol, and <a href="https://app.kamino.finance/lending/multiply">Kamino Multiply</a>.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/beb695eef2c858588c0fe6762f409a19e1ca0e9f-6432x3596.png?w=800" /><p>MNDE has a market cap of $88 million, ranking it 517th among all tokens. There has been a strong correlation between MNDE’s market cap and fees paid when denominated in USD. Both figures have seen growth since the beginning of Q4’23. Marinade has collected over $1.2 million in <a href="https://dune.com/queries/3232325/5406617">fees</a> in the past year. Around 90% of these fees have come from management fees, with the remaining from instant unstake fees. With most fees coming from Marinade Liquid management fees, fees paid denominated in SOL follow a similar trend to Marinade Liquid TVL: staying relatively flat since the beginning of 2022. Beyond SOL price appreciation and Marinade Liquid TVL growth, Marinade could increase its fees collected by beginning to monetize Marinade Native.</p><h2><strong>Competitive Landscape</strong></h2><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/ad5207f6794b5c54d56eb5255a9847e5f26b1738-6400x3468.png?w=800" /><p>Marinade was the first liquid staking protocol on Solana. From its launch until September 12, 2023, Marinade had maintained a majority share of Solana liquid staking TVL. The other main liquid staking protocol throughout that period was Lido, which <a href="https://blog.lido.fi/sunset-lido-on-solana/">sunsetted</a> its Solana instance in early October 2023. However, in the second half of 2023, several newer protocols began gaining traction, driven by points programs for airdrops.</p><p>Jito <a href="https://twitter.com/jito_sol/status/1702396552332058919">introduced</a> its points system in mid-September, which was then used as criteria for its early December <a href="https://twitter.com/jito_sol/status/1732794280618668363">airdrop</a>. Jito’s liquid staking protocol launched in November 2022, along with its MEV-optimized fork of the Solana Labs validator. Jito only delegates to validators that run the Jito MEV client. While Marinade doesn’t share this restriction, most validators in Marinade’s set still run the client. Since its airdrop, Jito has surpassed Marinade in liquid staking TVL, at 9.2 million SOL to 6.9 million SOL, respectively. JTO’s market cap is almost $375 million.</p><p>Similarly, SolBlaze <a href="https://twitter.com/solblaze_org/status/1688480225255161856">launched</a> its points system in early August, soon after launching its token BLZE and began <a href="https://twitter.com/solblaze_org/status/1692227422387867728">airdropping</a> it to points holders. Of the total BLZE supply, 64.5% is being airdropped to users through the initial airdrop and ongoing rewards. SolBlaze has amassed 2.7 million SOL TVL.</p><p>At the end of September, lending protocol MarginFi <a href="https://twitter.com/marginfi/status/1706690880093221119">launched</a> its own LST, aptly named LST. The LST routes stake to three validators run by the MarginFi team, <a href="https://twitter.com/mrgnalt/status/1707436923738833237">differentiating</a> by trading off decentralization for a <a href="https://twitter.com/ponzirespecter/status/1708586122274549872">higher</a> staking yield. MarginFi also recently <a href="https://twitter.com/marginfi/status/1762865889035317679">released</a> the whitepaper for stablecoin YBX, which will be backed by jitoSOL, mSOL, bSOL, and LST.</p><p>With the increase in Solana network activity, total <a href="https://dune.com/queries/3227834/5397784">base and priority fees</a> have risen notably. Validators typically do not distribute these fees to stakers. In the past, this has not mattered much as fees made up around 1% of <a href="https://dune.com/queries/3262652/5462544">total rewards</a> when combined with inflationary staking rewards. During Epoch 389, from March 14 to March 16, fees made up over 11% of total rewards. The increase led some single-validator LSTs like <a href="https://twitter.com/laine_sa_/status/1752976894780215566">laineSOL</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/knox_trades/status/1761364550845141455">jucySOL</a> to airdrop back a portion of these fees, raising their APYs above the standard 7-8% of other stake pools.</p><p>Sanctum is building a unified liquidity layer for Solana LSTs. It recently <a href="https://twitter.com/sanctumso/status/1765137015748563441">launched</a> the <a href="https://learn.sanctum.so/blog/understanding-sanctum/all-posts/a-deep-dive-into-the-economics-of-sanctum-infinity">Infinity</a> protocol and the INF LST (previously scnSOL). Sanctum Infinity Pool is a multi-LST liquidity pool containing 22 LSTs, including mSOL. By allowing any LST to tap into another’s liquidity, Sanctum may prevent the monopolistic/oligopolistic market structures that have arisen in other liquid staking ecosystems such as Ethereum. Thus, while Sanctum benefits Marinade by increasing liquidity for mSOL, it may also disadvantage Marinade as one of the market leaders. However, as MetaDAO notes in its <a href="https://hackmd.io/@metaproph3t/SJ1fMUlOT?utm_source=preview-mode&amp;utm_medium=rec">report</a> for Marinade, Marinade’s PSR feature could provide a defensible moat for it over new entrants: a validator would be less likely to provide a bond for a liquid staking protocol that is not yet delegating them a meaningful amount of SOL.</p><p>Marinade Liquid maintains a 34% market share among Solana liquid staking protocols. Its drop in market share has largely come from the growth of the Solana liquid staking pie rather than Marinade Liquid losing TVL. For perspective, Solana’s liquid staking rate began 2023 at 2.6% and currently stands at almost 5%.</p><p>Marinade differentiates itself by also having a native staking product. For reference, when grouped with liquid staking protocols, Marinade Native has a 16% market share. With Marinade Native's early success in attracting stake, Marinade DAO may explore strategies to monetize the product.</p><h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2><p>Marinade was the first liquid staking solution on Solana. Since its August 2021 launch, it has amassed 6.7 million SOL ($1.2 billion as of March 15, 2024) in liquid staking TVL, but growth has stagnated since the end of 2021 due to the bear market and more competition. However, Marinade as a whole has continued to grow with the launch of Marinade Native, a native staking solution. Since its July 2023 launch, Marinade Native has gained 3.6 million SOL in TVL ($630 million as of March 15, 2024). The continued rollout of Protected Staking Rewards and the upcoming delegation strategy upgrade will allow Marinade to expand the number of validators it delegates to without sacrificing performance. With updates like these already well underway, Marinade is well-poised to capitalize on the recent momentum in the Solana ecosystem.</p></div>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：
这些信息是积极的。Syscoin是一个开源、去中心化的开发平台，旨在结合比特币的PoW安全性和以太坊的可编程性。其模块化设计支持EVM rollups和其他Layer-2扩展技术。Syscoin的生态和用户群主要发展在Rollux L2上，其由Syscoin L1提供基础设施支持。Rollux是一个基于Optimism的分叉，旨在实现快速、低成本的微交易，同时确保高价值用例的安全性。通过零知识证明和基于ZK的SYS轻客户端，zkDA被建立，旨在扩展到其他链上。Syscoin的技术路线图包括增长策略和潜在风险，如合并挖矿和奖励结构。Syscoin仍需提高开发者和用户采用率，以实现在加密领域的成功。 <div>
<div><h2>Key Insights</h2><ul><li><strong>Syscoin is an open-source and decentralized development platform that aims to combine the security of Bitcoin’s PoW and programmability of Ethereum’s EVM.</strong> Its modularity allows it to support EVM rollups and other Layer-2 scaling technologies.</li><li><strong>The growth of Syscoin’s user base and ecosystem primarily takes place on an L2 called <a href="https://rollux.com">Rollux</a>, which was deployed to mainnet on June 28, 2023.</strong> The Syscoin L1 itself serves as the infrastructure, with SYS also serving as the native coin of Rollux.</li><li><strong>Syscoin L1 utilizes merge-mining as it aims to give L2s the security of Bitcoin’s own network</strong>.</li><li><strong>Rollux is an Optimism fork built to be fast and low-cost enough for microtransactions, </strong>yet secured from beneath in such a way as to support high-value use cases.</li><li><strong>Rollux uses Syscoin’s general-purpose data availability solution called Proof-of-Data Availability (PoDA) to link to Syscoin L1,</strong> which is supported by Bitcoin miners.</li><li>Through the use of zero-knowledge proofs and a ZK-based light client for SYS, <strong>zkDA was established with the goal of extending PoDA to other chains</strong>.</li></ul><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Blockchain scaling solutions have been some of crypto’s most popular ecosystems. There has been a constant battle to bring efficient throughput, cheap transaction fees, and speed amongst protocols, even during market downtrends. Last year alone, scaling solutions and new Proof-of-Stake (PoS) chains have raised <a href="https://messari.io/fundraising-data">over</a> $2 billion in private funding.</p><p>Syscoin is notable for its evolution over the past nine years. It was the first protocol to combine Bitcoin's Proof-of-Work network with the flexibility of EVM-equivalence within a modular architecture that fully supports rollups with a native data availability protocol. Syscoin’s goal is to provide decentralized technology and infrastructure that can scale to future demands in mass adoption scenarios. In January 2024, it took significant steps forward to the end, launching zero-knowledge data availability (zkDA) functionality to extend its offering to other blockchains and rollups</p><p>The project has completed both the base-layer infrastructure and the deployment of a scalable L2 called Rollux. This layer already shows a growing ecosystem of DeFi protocols, tools, and applications. Enterprises such as SYS Labs are focused on launching new applications and products designed to leverage Rollux and additional fractal scaling or application layers on top of Syscoin.</p><h2>Background</h2><p>Syscoin mainnet launched in 2014 as a fork of Litecoin. It aimed to enhance the capabilities of a traditional PoW chain by enabling features like “aliases” (decentralized identity), “certificates” (NFTs), and a working onchain decentralized marketplace. Dan Wasyluk and Sebastian Schepis initially led the project.</p><p>In 2015, Lead Core Developer and now Foundation President Jagdeep Sidhu joined the project. He shifted the project’s primary focus toward solving the bigger challenge of blockchain scalability rather than offering hardcoded smart contracts that would inevitably hit limits. Syscoin has been supported by the Syscoin Foundation, an organization created in 2016 by Syscoin’s <a href="https://syscoin.org/about">core team</a>, which includes <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jagdeep-sidhu-2a7bb76b/">Jagdeep Sidhu</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/willyko/">Willy Ko</a>.</p><p>The project had a <a href="https://messari.io/asset/syscoin/profile/launch-and-initial-token-distribution">public token sale</a> in 2014, selling 15% of the initial token supply for over 1,500 BTC, worth around $300,000 at the time. However, the BTC raised during the sale was <a href="https://www.newsbtc.com/news/former-moolah-ceo-alex-green-aka-ryan-kennedy-arrested-uk/">stolen</a> by the escrow agent, Ryan Kennedy, the former CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange Moolah. The funds were not recovered. Despite this obstacle, the project team continued developing Syscoin and successfully delivered the product reflected in its initial proposal.</p><p>Syscoin progressed by revamping its platform and product offerings by developing Syscoin 2.0 and 3.0 between 2017 and 2019. Within that period, the team introduced various technical updates, such as transitioning the network’s Scrypt-based chain to SHA-256 with merged mining, integrating customized <a href="https://docs.syscoin.org/docs/tech/sentrynodes">Sentry nodes</a>, and developing the <a href="https://docs.syscoin.org/docs/tech/z-dag">Zero-confirmation Directed Acyclic Graph (Z-DAG)</a> scalability upgrade.</p><p>In May 2019, the Syscoin project team <a href="https://syscoin.org/news/syscoin-40-launch-date-confirmed">announced</a> the launch of the Syscoin 4.0 mainnet which would include a number of upgrades including Taproot. These events led up to the introduction of Syscoin’s Network-Enhanced Virtual Machine (NEVM), brought live to mainnet on Dec. 6, 2021, in version 4.3. Immediately afterwards, Syscoin Foundation began focusing on the next steps: enshrining data availability within the Syscoin protocol.</p><p>Once the coding of <a href="https://docs.rollux.com/docs/sys/PoDA/">Proof of Data Availability</a> (PoDA) began in 2022, SYS Labs was formed and was eventually registered in the UAE. The new enterprise began coordinating with Syscoin Foundation to develop the ecosystem’s first rollup. The rollup became known as Rollux and would be based on Optimism yet with additional functionality enabling it to run on top of Syscoin and to leverage PoDA. On March 13, 2023, Syscoin Foundation <a href="https://syscoin.org/news/syscoin-releases-poda-nearing-rollux-launch">announced the mainnet release of PoDA</a>. Shortly after, <a href="https://syscoin.org/news/rollux-begins-liftoff">the final testnet deployment of Rollux was announced</a>, followed by <a href="https://x.com/RolluxL2/status/1674055458070437890">the mainnet release</a> on June 28, 2023.</p><h2>Technology</h2><h3>Network Architecture</h3><p></p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/24c550ad9916cb049e9c7c2f64052a72eaad7a15-3840x2464.png?w=800" /><p>The Syscoin L1 is a dual-chain architecture, featuring a PoW base chain and an EVM-compatible chain (NEVM), which are integrated within the Syscoin protocol. The foundational chain is UTXO-based like Bitcoin and runs on a merge-mined consensus mechanism, tying its security to Bitcoin. The NEVM chain provides EVM-compatible execution, such as smart contract deployment and interoperability with other EVM networks.<br /></p><h4>Base Chain (UTXO)</h4><p>The base chain houses Syscoin’s merge-mined PoW layer. The Syscoin network can leverage hashpower from Bitcoin’s own network through the process known as merged mining. Merged mining allows miners to mine multiple blockchains simultaneously via <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Merged_mining_specification">Auxillary Proof-of-Work (AuxPoW)</a>. For Syscoin, the Bitcoin chain acts as the “parent chain” to a miner and allocates hashpower, while Syscoin performs the role of the “auxiliary chain.” Therefore, by aligning its algorithm with Bitcoin’s (SHA-256), Syscoin can utilize Bitcoin miners’ hash power. Currently, over 50% of the Bitcoin mining hash power is used to mine Syscoin blocks, as can be seen by comparing the <a href="https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/bitcoin/hashrate-chart">Bitcoin</a> and <a href="https://www.coinwarz.com/mining/syscoin/hashrate-chart">Syscoin</a> hashrate charts. Miners on the base chain interact with the Operating System layer or NEVM by publishing completed Syscoin blocks to the NEVM.</p><p></p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/378fa292e7f8b87963a9376d82d31761c3268af2-1044x1044.jpg?w=800" /><p><em>Source: </em><a href="https://docs.rollux.com/docs/sys/PoDA/#hash-based-blobs&amp;gid=1&amp;pid=2">Syscoin Docs</a></p><p>As of March 23, 2023, the Syscoin base chain also provides a native data availability protocol and associated fee market called <a href="https://docs.rollux.com/docs/sys/PoDA/">Proof of Data Availability</a> (PoDA). PoDA is designed to support any kind of rollup, including optimistic and ZK-based ones, and it can be used by both EVM and non-EVM systems. While PoDA serves the same basic purpose as Ethereum’s proto-danksharding (<a href="https://www.eip4844.com/">EIP-4844</a>), it differs in regards to how data is stored, presented, and pruned, as well as in how fees are calculated. For example, PoDA uses <a href="https://keccak.team/keccak.html">Keccak cryptography</a> instead of KZG polynomial commitments required in Ethereum’s danksharding design.</p><p>Additionally, unlike a traditional UTXO network such as Bitcoin, users can mint fungible and non-fungible <a href="https://docs.syscoin.org/docs/tech/tokens/">Syscoin Platform Tokens</a> (SPTs) on the Syscoin base chain, which are UTXO-based tokens. The base chain also includes Taproot functionality identical to that of Bitcoin, and as such, Bitcoin-style ordinals can be created and transferred.<br /></p><h4>Operating System Chain</h4><p><a href="https://docs.syscoin.org/docs/tech/nevm/">Syscoin NEVM</a> is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chain where smart contracts can be created and deployed. NEVM works in sync with Syscoin’s base chain layer. This is achieved by pushing the tip hash generated on the NEVM into Syscoin’s base chain blocks. Users on NEVM can mint EVM-compatible tokens, execute smart contracts, and bridge to the ecosystem’s L2 EVM rollup, Rollux. Any token standards supported by Ethereum are also supported by NEVM (ERC-20, 721, 1155, etc.).</p><p>The NEVM relies on the PoW base chain for consensus and settlement. Block hashes from the NEVM are included in base chain blocks. By interlinking these chains, Syscoin provides a single Layer-1 that leverages traditional PoW network security and Ethereum’s smart contract capability. Of note, SYS is the native coin of both chains, and its supply can be automatically bridged between both chains by users via a mechanism that uses SPV proofs to mint/burn.<br /></p><h4>Rollux: A Rollup for Scalable Execution by Applications</h4><p>Having delivered on its modular tech stack roadmap (including the data availability protocol discussed later in this report, and the Rollux L2), Syscoin Foundation, aided by SYS Labs, is now focused on supporting and expanding its L2 ecosystem. It’s also seeking to participate in joint research and development on ZK-based solutions involving light clients, cross-chain technologies, and application-specific rollups that include non-EVM runtimes.</p><p></p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/7669fea9c17c4864ae1d311699024766c2bf5fc5-1600x900.png?w=800" /><p>So far, Syscoin has faced challenges with user and developer adoption due to the slower speed of its security-focused Layer-1 and the lack of an available Layer-2. Regardless, the team has stuck to its modular design principles and has since deployed the Rollux L2. Rollux now features an <a href="https://rollux.com/ecosystem">emerging ecosystem</a> of applications and protocols that could make SYS competitive. <a href="https://syslabs.com">SYS Labs</a>, an enterprise, is developing several products in addition to Rollux that will be deployed within the ecosystem, in addition to independent onboarding and integrations now seen within the ecosystem.</p><h3>Consensus Mechanism</h3><h4>Participants</h4><p><strong>Miners</strong></p><p>Miners participate in merged mining with Bitcoin, which provides Syscoin’s security and base-chain consensus mechanism. Miners interact with the Operating System layer or NEVM by publishing completed Syscoin blocks to the network and are rewarded in SYS.</p><p><strong>Sentry Nodes</strong></p><p>Syscoin <a href="https://docs.syscoin.org/docs/tech/sentrynodes">Sentry Nodes</a> are incentivized full nodes for both the base and NEVM chains, operating on the same machine and providing a second layer of services to the network. Apart from recording and hosting full copies of the network’s state, Syscoin Sentry nodes provide a <a href="https://chainz.cryptoid.info/sys/masternodes.dws">decentralized means of finality</a> through multi-quorum chainlocks via BLS signatures. The Syscoin team intentionally designed this structure to stay true to their core belief in PoW blockchains. Rather than relegating back to a pure PoS system, Syscoin uses these nodes for finality through a <a href="https://syscoin.medium.com/revealing-the-method-in-the-madness-ee9b2b619fd8#:~:text=Finality%20%E2%80%94%20Multi%2DQuorum%20Chainlocks">carefully thought-out process of chainlocks</a>.</p><p>Syscoin’s finality is an additive security on top of the Nakamoto PoW consensus. It makes merged mining safer by creating resistance, yet the chain and network will also continue in its absence. Unlike Dash and many other networks that utilize masternodes, Syscoin’s Sentry nodes do not serve as a subset of trusted validators. Instead, Syscoin’s network prioritizes decentralization by maintaining the same approach as Bitcoin, where all full nodes verify before trusting. Aside from participating in finality quorums and decentralized governance, Syscoin Sentry nodes serve the same role as any standard full node.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/eff4631dcc3a1fb9145d9ef83a4e02fb19504b79-1600x791.jpg?w=800" /><p><em>Source: </em><a href="https://sysnode.info/stats">Sysnode.info</a></p><p>Sentry nodes need to stake 100,000 SYS to participate in supporting network functionality. It should be noted that the collateral required to operate a Sentry node stays in the owner’s self-custody, and it can be unstaked at any time and moved to a new address by its owner. However, moving it eliminates the seniority Sentry node owners earn. Seniority incentivizes Sentry node operators to keep their nodes running and their collateral in place by rewarding additional SYS. The rewards are doled out first after one year and then reach full maturity after 2.5 years, which brings a 100% bonus over the base rewards. Currently, <a href="https://syscoin.org/masternodes#:~:text=Today%2C%20over%2050%25%20of%20masternodes%20serving%20our%20network%20have%20been%20active%20for%20longer%20than%202.5%20years.">nearly half</a> of Syscoin’s ~2,700 Sentry nodes are operating at full maturity (over 2.5 years). Hardware requirements for setting up a Syscoin Sentry node can be found <a href="https://docs.syscoin.org/docs/guides/sentrynode_setup">here</a>. APR and other income-focused metrics can be found <a href="https://sysnode.info/stats">here</a>.</p><h3>Mechanism</h3><p>The Syscoin base layer inherits Bitcoin’s own security via <a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/glossary/merged-mining">merged mining</a>. Merged mining was <a href="https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1790.msg28696#msg28696">proposed by Satoshi Nakamoto</a> and made part of Bitcoin Core in 2010. It enables Bitcoin miners to mine multiple cryptocurrencies by simultaneously providing their hash power to numerous blockchains, without incurring additional energy expenses beyond what they already spend to support Bitcoin. At the time of this research, Syscoin is inheriting around 60% of Bitcoin's own hashrate, as seen by comparing the ratio of hashrates of <a href="https://miningpoolstats.stream/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> and <a href="https://miningpoolstats.stream/syscoin">Syscoin</a>.</p><p>By providing its own native EIP1559-based utility coin (SYS) to Bitcoin miners, Syscoin incentivizes them to continue supporting Bitcoin in the face of Bitcoin’s diminishing block rewards and static fees. SYS has similar utility-focused economics as ETH, thus it does not intrude upon BTC’s economics.</p><p>In effect, merged mining allows miners to mine multiple blockchains simultaneously via <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Merged_mining_specification">Auxiliary Proof-of-Work (AuxPoW)</a>. <a href="https://www.n-able.com/blog/sha-256-encryption#:~:text=SHA%2D256%20is%20a%20patented,as%20long%20as%20when%20unencrypted.">SHA-256</a>-compliant projects such as <a href="https://rootstock.io/">Rootstock</a> and <a href="https://www.namecoin.org/">Namecoin</a> utilize merged mining with the Bitcoin network. Furthermore, any PoW blockchain can utilize merge-mining, with one example being Dogecoin merge-mined with Litecoin. AuxPoW incorporates a “parent chain” that allocates hashpower to auxiliary chains. An added benefit of this approach is that merge-mining does not require additional mining resources, making it effectively the only carbon-neutral form of PoW.</p><p>In Syscoin’s case, Bitcoin acts as the “parent chain.” As such, Bitcoin miners can choose to allocate hashpower to Syscoin’s PoW chain and mine both Bitcoin and Syscoin simultaneously without committing additional resources.</p><h3>Multi-Quorum Finality</h3><p>Since the number of miners participating in mining SYS is smaller than Bitcoin’s entire network of miners, the possibility of a 51% attack increases. In a 51% network attack, malicious miners can control which blocks will be mined, interrupting the network and preventing honest miners from completing new blocks. Therefore, Syscoin leverages chainlocks, a mechanism first <a href="https://www.dash.org/news/chainlocks/">introduced </a>by Dash, to increase its security. Syscoin’s particular implementation of chainlocks relies on multiple Long Living Masternode Quorums (LLMQs) that decide on the next block to be mined. Thereby providing a second layer of verifying the correct order of block mining, Syscoin greatly mitigates the risk of a successful 51% attack, given that finality prevents selfish mining concerns. Miners would only be able to selfishly mine within the finality window (5 blocks), or else they’d be forced to restart their work and compete with the other Bitcoin miners on the Bitcoin network to mine 5 blocks before anyone else can mine 1 block).</p><p>These chainlocks are established at a relatively high degree of Nakamoto coefficient. The mechanism involves four separate quorums, each consisting of 400 randomly selected Sentry nodes (1,600 in total), which are reformed periodically. This same mechanism also serves to provide finality for smart contracts on NEVM and the Rollux L2. In order for a 51% attacker to succeed, they would have to control over 50% of the portion of Bitcoin’s hashrate supporting Syscoin and control a supermajority (60%+) of Syscoin Sentry nodes. Due to the validators and finality, there is an additional risk of halting a chain by voting on invalid block headers. But, Syscoin averts this problem by allowing this condition to have finality fall back to the previous chainlock in said scenario.</p><p>This finality is a core component of the ZK light client for Syscoin’s zkDA. It will enable Syscoin to validate the DA’s existence and prevent the SYS chain from rolling back from its DA inclusion. This feature will allow optimistic rollups to be incorporated, given that they require determinism to be included.</p><p><br /><br /></p><h3>Scaling Features</h3><h4>Base Chain Scaling: Z-DAG</h4><p>Before launching the NEVM chain, the Syscoin team aimed to add transaction scaling features to its base chain PoW layer. One of these features was Zero-confirmation Directed Acyclic Graph or <a href="https://docs.syscoin.org/docs/tech/z-dag/">Z-DAG</a>. Z-DAG is a throughput scalability solution created by Syscoin’s Lead Developer, Jag Sidhu. It is used to support asset transactions on Syscoin’s base UTXO chain. Syscoin engineered Z-DAG as a redundancy protocol to the existing transaction settlement mechanism provided by PoW. This allows transactions broadcasted to the network to be relayed to their destination before requiring verification, providing peer-to-peer “fast transactions” or “micro transactions” of SPTs, including the native token, SYS, on the Syscoin base chain. Z-DAG aims to become a <a href="https://res.cloudinary.com/dl8wrczbj/image/upload/v1628251926/HouseofChimera/Report-PDFs/Syscoin-Paper-August_iceisl.pdf">viable option</a> for scaling simple value transactions, given that it can exceed the throughput of major credit card processors like Visa and MasterCard.</p><h4>Syscoin Bridge</h4><p>The Syscoin bridge operates as a two-way mechanism between its native blockchain and the NEVM platform that utilizes Syscoin Platform Tokens (SPT) as intermediaries. The process begins by burning of SYS tokens on the native blockchain and then issuing an equivalent amount of SYSX (SPT) tokens. These SYSX tokens are then locked within the bridge's infrastructure to prevent double-spending. Next, the same amount in SYS tokens in ERC-20 format is minted on the NEVM.</p><p>The same process works in reverse: burning the SYS ERC-20 tokens on the NEVM, unlocking the equivalent amount of SYSX on the Syscoin blockchain, and restoring the SYS tokens on the Syscoin network. This structure aims to maintain a constant total supply of SYS across both blockchains and to tap into Ethereum’s ecosystem.</p><p>Of note, the team has stated that SPT tokens could also be bridged to the NEVM via the Syscoin bridge. However, users must refer to Syscoin bridge <a href="https://github.com/syscoin/sysethereum-contracts">contracts</a> to enable specific bridging of non-SYS tokens. According to the <a href="https://github.com/syscoin/sysethereum-docs">documentation</a>, the bridge is a “non-custodial” implementation where a bridge operator does not manage tokens during the process.</p><h2>Tokenomics</h2><h3>SYS Utility and Features</h3><p>Syscoin’s native utility token, SYS, is used for payments, gas fees, and network security (Sentry node staking and miner block rewards).</p><h3>SYS Distribution</h3><p>Upon launch of the network’s mainnet in 2014, SYS initially had a max supply of 2 billion tokens. More recently in 2021, the SYS supply has since been updated with the integration of <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559">EIP-1559</a>, is currently uncapped, and is <a href="https://syscoin.org/news/nevm-and-related-changes-to-syscoin">estimated</a> to have an inflationary rate of 1.25% per year. The breakdown of the token’s distribution will take into account the current state of the SYS supply:</p><ul><li>Initial distribution: A total of <a href="https://github.com/syscoin/syscoin1/blob/master/src/main.cpp">364 million SYS</a> was mined and distributed upon the mainnet deployment of Syscoin V1 on August 17, 2014, primarily to pre-sale participants. At that time, with SYS max supply capped at 2 billion, this represented 18% of the max supply. In terms of today’s circulating supply it represents 48%. Based upon the average pre-sale purchase price of SYS at ~490 satoshis (0.0000049 BTC) with Bitcoin trading around $510 USD, the total value of the distribution is estimated at ~$910k USD.&nbsp; Allocations were as follows (with estimated value):<ul><li>Public token sale: 304,222,858 SYS ($760,252 USD)</li><li>Development, marketing, and operations: 40 million SYS ($99,960 USD)</li><li>Bounties and rewards: 20 million SYS ($49,980 USD)</li></ul></li><li>Base chain block rewards: At launch, 96.25 SYS was minted for each base chain block, with that amount decreasing by 5% yearly and an additional yearly reward halving. Notably, 90% of base chain block rewards go to consensus participants. Of the 90%, 25% go to miners, and 75% go to Sentry nodes. The remaining 10% is allocated towards decentralized governance that functions the same as Dash governance. Governance funds are emitted in monthly superblocks to fund proposals ratified by Sentry node voters. Superblock funding similarly diminishes over time and details can be seen <a href="https://sysnode.info/governance">here</a>.</li><li>NEVM block rewards: Only <a href="https://syscoin.org/news/nevm-and-related-changes-to-syscoin">miners</a> participating in merged mining and contributing to the Syscoin base chain layer can earn NEVM block rewards. NEVM block rewards are emitted at a constant rate of 10.55 SYS per block processed on the NEVM layer. Of note, NEVM block rewards are generated on the NEVM chain.</li><li>Transaction fees: Transaction fees across the base chain and NEVM are sent to miners and Sentry node operators in a 50/50 split. Of note, the project team has implemented <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559">EIP-1559</a>, introduced by Ethereum in 2019, which enforces a fee-burning <a href="https://consensys.net/blog/quorum/what-is-eip-1559-how-will-it-change-ethereum/">mechanism</a> for gas fees paid by users and/or smart contract deployments.</li></ul><p>Just prior to the release of NEVM, in October 2021, the Syscoin Foundation proposed a Treasury Fund to governance participants. After the proposal <a href="https://syscoin.org/file/syscoinfoundation-nevmrelease-treasuryfundsubstantiation.pdf">passed</a>, 100 million SYS tokens (~14.8% of the total circulating supply at that time) were minted. They have been allocated to fund the continued development of the Syscoin network at the <a href="https://messari.io/organization/syscoin-foundation">Syscoin Foundation’s</a> discretion. A breakdown of the treasury allocations includes:</p><ul><li>65 million SYS (~9.7% of the total circulating supply) has been allocated towards general core team funding and project onboarding/integrations.</li><li>35 million SYS (~5.2% of the total circulating supply) has been allocated towards future VC/private funding rounds.</li></ul><h2>Network Activity</h2><p></p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/98e27d6bafe4070ef2d37a3f8fe3d4ee94ce23e4-1307x613.png?w=800" /><p>In terms of <a href="https://explorer.syscoin.org/">network activity</a>, Syscoin still has a significant road to cover compared to its peers. Active wallets on the Syscoin NEVM total just <a href="https://explorer.syscoin.org/">over</a> 40,000, and over 200 tokens have been <a href="https://explorer.syscoin.org/tokens?holder_count=1&amp;items_count=200&amp;name=blockmarket">launched</a>/created on the network. To give a frame of reference, Ethereum has over 219 million wallets. Syscoin’s L2, Rollux has seen more network activity, averaging over <a href="https://explorer.rollux.com/">50,000 daily transactions</a> in the last month.</p><h2>The Road Ahead</h2><h3>Growth Strategies</h3><p>According to the Syscoin 4.0 Whitepaper, one of Syscoin’s main focuses is developing more scaling solutions. Syscoin has gone through multiple technical upgrades and iterations over the years. Although the project has been heavily focused on developing its underlying tech stack, integrating the NEVM and future scaling upgrades (PoDA and rollups) indicates a new step in the protocol’s evolution.</p><p>The Syscoin 4.0 Whitepaper also describes the integration of SDK and Application Layers. The SDK layer supports scalability solutions such as <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/zk-rollups/#:~:text=ZK%2Drollups%20are%20%22hybrid%20scaling,update%20to%20the%20rollup's%20state.">ZK-rollups</a> for the NEVM and an Application Layer allowing applications to be built on the SDK Layer. With these additions, the team has increased transaction speed, lowered costs, and increased scalability for users and developers. As of today, the project has adopted <a href="https://syscoin.org/rollux">Rollux</a> as the network’s first rollup on the SDK layer. Rollux is a scaling solution based on a fork of the <a href="https://www.optimism.io/">Optimism</a> network <a href="https://github.com/sys-labs/rollux/commit/25a4c9410ddae31ff7195f67495491f71e684e03">refactored to utilize Syscoin’s PoDA protocol</a>. It is currently live on mainnet.</p><p>Below is the four-layer tech stack for Syscoin per the <a href="https://syscoin.org/file/syscoin4-whitepaper.pdf">Syscoin 4.0 Whitepaper</a></p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/60f08ab9959cc48e760477e68f84181eb9a6abc9-3840x3832.png?w=800" /><p></p><p>Additionally, the team <a href="https://syscoin.org/news/syscoin-poda-is-live-on-the-tanenbaum-network">announced</a> the release of a dedicated data availability protocol named PoDA (Proof of Data Availability) for securing the SDK layer. Data availability allows nodes on a network to gain access to data contained within all rollup or L2 blocks. This, in turn, mitigates potential security risks if a block producer for a rollup or other L2 refuses to make transaction data available which would compromise the integrity of the data verified by nodes. Data availability services typically aim to operate with the same security assumptions as the L1 chain where rollup users would move their funds if they were to exit the rollup. Syscoin’s PoDA directly fulfills this demand. Also, Rollux gains this benefit at a low cost rather than turning to third-party data availability providers to cut costs. Doing so mitigates the risk of extra security assumptions that reside outside the domain of the L1. Like Rollux, rollups that use Syscoin as their L1 through PoDA would also gain this benefit.</p><p>Protocols such as Celestia aim to provide data availability to other chains. With Syscoin’s recent zkDA launch, it has staked its offering on an in-house data availability layer rather than relying on third-party ones. With this, the team has introduced the ability for further throughput scalability to its rollup-centric SDK layer. This DA is also designed to serve L3s and other successive application layers, or “fractal layers,” that are built on top of the Rollux L2.<br /></p><p>Ultimately, the team aims to have Syscoin serve as the go-to, BTC-secured DA layer for other chains. As such, Syscoin has been developing a BTC-based mechanism similar to re-staking. It aims to give crypto-economic security to the Bitcoin L2 community and others, akin to what Eigen Layer provides to the Ethereum community. These features might appeal to emerging Bitcoin L2 projects, which currently depend upon third-party DA and various MPC/multi-signature agreements for bridging BTC.&nbsp; Additionally, Syscoin’s offerings could appeal to projects seeking the security and resilience guarantees of Bitcoin’s PoW rather than relying solely on PoS systems. While promising, it should be noted that these features are still under development.<br /></p><p>The project team also plans on promoting a user and developer-friendly environment, attracting more applications, traffic, and TVL to its network. The team states that in the near future they will execute a multi-pronged strategy that includes social-driven advertising, hackathons, and other events, as well as point-based campaigns. The end goal is to promote activity and TVL associated with SYS Labs’ several oncoming DeFi protocols, applications, and offerings. The Syscoin Foundation treasury is also used to foster the ecosystem and increase the number of projects onboarding to the network. Ultimately, the aim is for these projects to gain independent funding, in the same way that <a href="https://superdapp.ai">SuperDapp</a> managed to recently.<br /></p><p>They also hope to implement their DAOSYS DeFi framework, providing an autonomous service engine to help developers create their own treasuries/DAOs to fund projects. It uses a concept roughly similar to Alchemix’s “self-repaying loans” but more focused on ecosystem growth.</p><p>The same new DeFi primitive in DAOSYS, which SYS Labs coins as ”<a href="https://pachira.finance/Pachira_One_Pager.pdf">liquidity trees</a>,” is expected to have a separate implementation in a SYS Labs product called <a href="https://pachira.finance/">Pachira</a>. The end goal is to introduce more <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEabq9uAmiM">capital efficiency for liquidity pool providers</a> as well as cross-chain functionality. Liquidity trees could even be complementary to Uniswap V3 and other CLMM liquidity pool protocols.</p><h3>Potential Risks and Roadblocks</h3><p>Syscoin still has a long way to go in terms of developer and user adoption compared to larger L1 networks. In its current state, Syscoin has some risks to consider, including its use of merged mining, its reward structure, and its lagging participation rate.</p><p>With its newly launched zkDA capabilities, Syscoin could face analogous perils to what <a href="https://www.chainalysis.com/blog/cross-chain-bridge-hacks-2022/">bridges have repeatedly faced over the years</a>. A keen analysis of the risks associated with bridges and interoperability will be instrumental in safeguarding the network as it expands to become the premium BTC-secured DA layer for other chains.</p><p>Per the <a href="https://syscoin.org/file/syscoin4-whitepaper.pdf">Syscoin 4.0 Whitepaper</a> tokenomics section, the project team has projected that rewards for miners participating in merged mining will reach near zero due to the rewards' deflationary nature. While rewards will never be fully eliminated, potential vulnerabilities to the network may arise with the reduction in miner incentives and, consequently, participation in maintaining the network’s security, as seen in other PoW blockchains.</p><p>Despite Syscoin’s ongoing network infrastructure developments, it has struggled to attract significant participation rate in developer onboarding, transaction volume, and user activity. An increase in transaction volume and developer activity on the network may introduce more incentivization methods for miners and Sentry nodes as the network evolves. To potentially raise those incentives in the future, the project must address the onboarding of projects and users to create a flywheel effect.</p><h2>Closing Summary</h2><p>Syscoin has undergone several updates, iterations, and tech stack changes. Although it may not have the adoption of its counterparts, the protocol’s technical updates offer a novel approach to creating an L1 blockchain. Projects such as <a href="https://babylonchain.io/">Babylon Chain</a> on the Cosmos Network have attempted to adopt merged mining, similar to Syscoin, and leverage Bitcoin’s network security to address issues with PoS chains.</p><p>With the launches of Rollux and zkDA, Syscoin has been able to close the gap with its competition in terms of features and services provided. Specifically, its zkDA offering aims to address the dual demands of security and efficiency in the data availability space. Several features, including the integration of zero-knowledge proofs, the advantages of Bitcoin's PoW mechanism, and its focus on timely data pruning, help position Syscoin as a unique competitor in the space. For Syscoin to continue closing this gap, it might seek out partnerships with applications across ecosystems (DeFi, NFTs, etc.). The project team will also need to prioritize onboarding developers to survive in one of the most competitive ecosystems in the space.</p></div>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。众议院金融服务委员会就CFPB规则展开了辩论，共和党批评规则模糊不清、反对创新，并超出了CFPB的权力范围。一些民主党人同意共和党关于规则不明确的说法，但委员会的民主党领导人认为该规则加强了消费者保护和银行与非银行之间的监管平等。此外，两名成员敦促SEC不再批准任何加密货币交易所交易产品。总统拜登在白宫的新预算提案中再次支持数字资产挖矿税和将洗钱交易规则应用于加密资产等税收方面的更新。 <div>
<p>The House Financial Services Committee debated a CFPB rule that could add further uncertainty to the digital asset space. Republicans criticized the rule as ambiguous, anti-innovation, and outside the CFPB's authority. While some Democrats appear in agreement with Republican claims that the rule is unclear, Democrat leadership on the Committee argued the rule bolsters consumer protections and regulatory parity between banks and nonbanks. In a new letter, two Members urged the SEC not to approve any more crypto ETPs. And in the White House's new budget proposal, President Biden is once again supporting a digital asset mining tax and crypto-related updates to the tax code, like applying wash sale rules to crypto assets.</p>

However, the design of these systems restricts them from natively interacting with external data without help. As a resolution, blockchains rely on oracles to act as middlemen that aggregate external data and make it available for onchain application use.</p><p>Typically, oracle networks incentivize nodes to find certain information, come to a consensus on a value for particular data points, and publish such values to blockchains in set time periods. However, this “push” model can be indirect, expensive, and hard to scale. Pyth Network addresses these issues by fostering a network of primary source (first-party) data providers and coordinating a “pull” model. This model reduces latency, scales quickly, and lowers network costs by offloading update fees to data consumers (applications and developers).</p><p>Pyth (<a href="https://messari.io/project/pyth-network">PYTH</a>) is an oracle network that aims to offer accurate prices for cryptocurrencies, equities, foreign exchange pairs, ETFs, and commodities. It offers three core products:</p><ul><li><a href="https://pyth.network/price-feeds">Price Feeds</a> (live updates for smart contracts)</li><li><a href="https://pyth.network/benchmarks">Benchmarks</a> (historical market data)</li><li><a href="https://pyth.network/blog/secure-random-numbers-for-blockchains">Pyth Entropy</a> (secure random number generator)</li></ul><p>The robustness of Pyth’s data is largely due to its contributing publisher network, which comprises nearly <a href="https://pyth.network/publishers">100 data providers</a> from global exchanges, trading firms, market makers, institutions, and DeFi. A few notable providers include Jane Street, Chicago Trading Company (CTC), Binance, Raydium, Osmosis, Galaxy, and 0x. Pyth is focused on making financial market data available to developers on an expanding list of blockchain networks (<a href="https://pyth.network/blog/pyth-price-feeds-launch-on-hedera">50+ blockchains</a> as of writing).</p><p><a href="https://pyth.network/">Website</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/PythNetwork">X (Twitter)</a> / <a href="https://discord.com/invite/PythNetwork">Discord</a></p><h2>Technology</h2><p>In addition to bridging data between blockchains and the outside world, oracles strive to overcome the <a href="https://encyclopedia.pub/entry/2959">oracle problem</a>. The oracle problem refers to ensuring secure, authenticated, and trustworthy external data, while also considering the potential failures of external sources.</p><p>Addressing the oracle problem typically involves:</p><ul><li>Validators or oracle nodes sourcing data</li><li>Nodes cryptographically signing (verifying) the sourced data</li><li>Aggregation of the data and consensus of the calculated data point</li><li>Data transmission to the blockchain network</li></ul><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/082cf846315eca2ec4c0a38045809cf6e679ec74-3200x1800.png?w=800" /><p>The oracle problem is often addressed via a push or pull model. Most oracles use a third-party <strong><em>push model</em></strong>. In this model, oracle nodes are third parties that fetch data from either primary sources (i.e., exchanges) or secondary sources (i.e., data aggregators like CoinGecko and Kaiko). For instance, Chainlink’s primary price feed oracle nodes fetch data from <a href="https://chain.link/education/blockchain-oracles">secondary sources</a>. Push oracles push price updates to individual blockchains at set intervals, paying gas costs for every onchain update. Adding price feeds or decreasing latency between onchain updates incurs more costs for the oracle network, impeding its ability to scale. Additionally, fetching data requires multiple trust assumptions: the primary source is correct and stable; the secondary source is correct and stable; and the oracle network is stable.</p><p>Pyth Network confronts the shortcomings of the third-party push model with its <strong><em>pull model</em></strong>. Through its provider network of <a href="https://pyth.network/publishers">first-party data sources</a>, Pyth addresses the two downstream trust assumptions of third-party data reliability. In Pyth’s pull model, data is provided directly by in-network exchanges, market makers, and DeFi protocols, like Jane Street, Binance, and Raydium. These entities are incentivized to behave honestly and to provide robust data to maintain a good reputation and avoid being banned by the protocol.</p><p>The remaining benefits hinge on offloading costs to the end consumer, where price feeds are updated on-demand instead of according to set time intervals. Hence, consumers initiate price updates, <em>pulling</em> the updates onchain in the same DeFi transaction (i.e., swapping assets, settling a perpetual swap, etc.). By offloading costs to users where updates are demand-based, Pyth redirects these costs and scales efficiently, as seen in its frequent updates on <a href="https://pyth.network/price-feeds">451 price feeds</a>.</p><h3>Core Interactions</h3><p>Pyth runs two instances of its protocol: one on the Solana mainnet and the other on the Pythnet appchain. Pyth on Solana only serves data to protocols on Solana; Pyth on Pythnet serves data to protocols on all other blockchains. Three core entities interact with each other to facilitate oracle updates on Pyth Network in both instances:</p><ul><li>Data Providers/Publishers (Jane Street, CTC, Binance, 0x, Raydium, etc.)</li><li>The Pyth Oracle Program (aggregation algorithm)</li><li>Data Consumers (applications/developers)</li></ul><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/2a3dc6fa67dda6f258b494ebc82ecc3d640c8156-3200x1800.png?w=800" /><p>Data publishers are validators on Pythnet. Previously, the <a href="https://pythdataassociation.com/">Pyth Data Association</a> was responsible for delegating an adequate stake to the validators; however, with the launch of <a href="https://app.realms.today/dao/PYTH">governance</a>, this will now be managed by PYTH holders. As of writing, there are no proposals to change the dynamics of validator stake, which are currently all weighted equally. As the first-party suppliers of Pyth data, publishers are compensated by a small fee charged as a part of the entire DeFi transaction initiated by consumers.</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-client?tab=readme-ov-file#pyth-client">Pyth Oracle Program</a> is the aggregation algorithm that combines data submitted by publishers and produces an aggregate price and confidence interval for respective price feeds at the time of calculation. It’s also responsible for maintaining the price feeds, storing individual inputs from publishers, and performing additional computations like a moving average. Applications and developers are the consumers who request to update price feeds to read the information produced by the Oracle Program.</p><h3>Pyth on Solana</h3><p>Price feeds are represented as two Solana accounts: product and price accounts. Product accounts store metadata about the price feed, like ticker symbol, asset type, corresponding price account, etc. Price accounts contain the names of the authorized data providers, the prices and confidence intervals each provider submits, exponential moving averages, etc. Both accounts are maintained by the Oracle Program, which also contains a third account that essentially just lists product accounts. This setup enables applications to catalog the full list of price feeds offered by Pyth.</p><p>Price updates are submitted by publishers every 400 ms (the length of a time slot on Solana). Each update triggers frequent price and confidence interval aggregation updates to be used downstream in applications. (Because the Oracle Program stores the individual data values submitted by each publisher, publishers can be held accountable for poor performance or malicious actions.) Solana’s low costs enable Pyth —&nbsp;or any oracle — to run an efficient push model where developers simply pass the relevant price feed to their application, deserialize the data, and read/integrate the already published value.</p><p><em>Of note: By the end of Q2, Pyth plans to fully migrate its Solana push oracle to a new Solana pull oracle. Through <a href="https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/target_chains/solana">development channels</a>, the Pyth team has noted that the Pyth pull oracle is live on devnet.</em></p><h3>Pythnet Appchain</h3><p>The Pythnet appchain is a Proof-of-Authority fork of Solana’s mainnet that acts as a computational base layer for processing and aggregating data provided by Pyth’s network of data publishers. The resulting price feeds on Pythnet are accessible to over <a href="https://pyth.network/blog/where-pyth-is-now-looking-towards-2024">50 blockchains</a> — excluding Solana, which has price feeds published directly to the blockchain. Because Pythnet is a fork of Solana, Pyth’s oracle framework on Solana and Pythnet are relatively similar with a few distinctions.</p><p>The push model on Solana described above (with accounts and the Oracle Program) is similar to Pythnet. However, Pythnet is not the destination chain and does not charge publishers for submitting prices. Hence, while data publishers push data to Pythnet to be aggregated and serialized into accounts via the Oracle Program, this data is then broadcast to other blockchains via <a href="https://wormhole.com/">Wormhole’s</a> cross-chain messaging protocol. Consumers then incur the costs on destination chains while initiating the data transfers with normal DeFi transactions that rely on oracle data — hence, pulling the data updates.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/3c020b05699f58e3b97717294f52e4b099f6020b-3200x1800.png?w=800" /><p><strong>Cross-Chain Messaging</strong></p><p>After data is published and aggregated on Pythnet, it is not immediately routed through Wormhole. Instead, Pyth routes its data through a message buffer and hashes it into a Merkle tree. Doing so ensures users can choose which updates are included in single transactions. It also keeps costs low for users and allows data updates to include arbitrary calculations. After every aggregation update, the aggregation program adds a message to the message buffer. For every slot, Pythnet validators read the messages and create a Merkle tree, sending a message containing the Merkle root of all the prices to the Wormhole contract on Pythnet.</p><p><a href="https://docs.wormhole.com/wormhole/explore-wormhole/guardian">Wormhole Guardians</a> (Wormhole nodes) then read the Merkle root message, create a Verifiable Action Approval (<a href="https://docs.wormhole.com/wormhole/explore-wormhole/vaa">VAA</a>), and broadcast price updates to the relevant blockchains. VAAs ensure that data is transferred reliably and securely. The VAAs include signatures from the Wormhole Guardians. These signatures confirm that the Guardians have witnessed and validated the information contained in the message, in this case, the Merkle root of the prices. The signed VAA is a verifiable and secure way to confirm that data transferred from Pythnet to the destination blockchain is accurate and has been authenticated by a trusted party (the Wormhole Guardians).</p><h3>Hermes</h3><p><a href="https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-crosschain/tree/main/hermes">Hermes</a> is a web API that abstracts the update initiation process for developers. Without a service like Hermes, developers must manually compile an updated payload with the desired price feeds and use the Wormhole-verified Merkle root to get the corresponding data and Merkle proofs from Pythnet. Hermes introduces the ability for developers to simply query the web service to access oracle prices. Hermes enables data consumers to retrieve the latest prices pulling from REST or Websocket APIs.</p><ul><li><strong>REST (a subset of HTTP) API features</strong><ul><li>Best-suited for applications that require ad-hoc access to the latest data, need data at irregular intervals, or request data under certain conditions.</li><li>Simple to implement and use.</li><li>Streamlined client-server interaction, given each request is independent.</li><li>Scenarios: portfolio tracking, loan origination or repayment, etc.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Websocket API features</strong><ul><li>Best-suited for applications requiring real-time, continuous data streaming.</li><li>Low maintenance: After the initial setup, data can be sent back and forth without the overhead of repeated HTTP headers, making it efficient for frequent data transmissions.</li><li>Given the persistent connection between the client and server, real-time updates enable instantaneous data updates.</li><li>Scenarios: arbitrage trading, yield-optimization tools, DEX trading, etc.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Hermes is permissionless, enabling any third party to build a simplified access point to the Pyth Network. Because it is operationally difficult to run, the Pyth Data Association maintains a public version. However, other companies, like <a href="https://www.triton.one/pythnet/">Triton</a>, <a href="https://p2p.org/">P2P</a>, <a href="https://www.liquify.io/">Liquify</a>, and <a href="https://extrnode.com/solana">EXTR</a> also offer their own hosted versions of Hermes. A growing list of node providers offering Hermes can be found <a href="https://docs.pyth.network/price-feeds/api-instances-and-providers/hermes#node-providers">here</a>.</p><h2>Tokenomics</h2><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/2a97d6843c16ce81a690e39add0121f00f44044c-3200x1800.png?w=800" /><p>Pyth’s ecosystem token PYTH has a maximum supply of 10 billion PYTH. After its first unlock in May 2024, its distribution will reflect the following breakdown:</p><ul><li><strong>Community &amp; Launch (6%)</strong>: For initial launch and related activities and initiatives.</li><li><strong>Publisher Rewards (22%)</strong>: For Pyth’s network of data publishers. Used for rewards, grant programs, and as an incentive to encourage publishers to support new assets that may initially lack liquidity.</li><li><strong>Ecosystem Growth (52%)</strong>: For contributors to the Pyth Network, including but not limited to developers, researchers, educators, and early publishers. The goal is to encourage initiatives and reward contributions that go beyond the founding team and core contributors.</li><li><strong>Protocol Development (10%)</strong>: For core contributors building tooling, products, and infrastructure (i.e., <a href="https://dourolabs.xyz/">Douro Labs</a>).</li><li><strong>Private Sales (10%)</strong>: For two funding rounds. Pyth has not disclosed the price per PYTH sold nor its valuation for either of the rounds. In <a href="https://pyth.network/blog/expanding-the-pyth-community-strategic-capital-and-new-builders">December 2023</a>, Pyth published an update about an earlier strategic round that included notable investors, such as Castle Island Ventures, Wintermute Ventures, Borderless Capital, CMT Digital, Bodhi Ventures, Distributed Global, Multicoin Capital, and Delphi Digital.</li></ul><h3>Governance</h3><p>The <a href="https://messari.io/project/pyth-network">PYTH</a> token is an <a href="https://spl.solana.com/token">SPL</a> token on Solana (equivalent to an <a href="https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20">ERC-20</a> on Ethereum). The core utility of PYTH is <a href="https://app.realms.today/dao/PYTH">governance</a>. PYTH holders can guide protocol development by staking the asset and voting on Pyth Improvement Proposals (PIPs). As of writing, the only proposals voted on or being voted on include the Pythian Council elections and the ratification of the <a href="https://github.com/pyth-network/governance/blob/309c716599617971c6abb18f2097412d977b954f/docs/constitution/pyth-dao-constitution.md">Pyth DAO Constitution</a>. Typical subject matters that governance encompasses and can modify include:</p><ul><li>Onchain software updates</li><li>Reward structures for data providers</li><li>Creating rules for permissioning publishers</li><li>Size, denomination, and existence of oracle update fees</li><li>Adding new price feeds and determining who supports them</li></ul><p>Pyth DAO consists of the Pythian Council and the Price Feed Council. Both councils hold elections every six months to rotate members of the councils. Additionally, members who participate less than one-third of the time are excluded from reelection. This system ensures active members play a part in the process and that members stay aligned with Pyth’s goals. Both councils are responsible for the voting and implementation of certain Operational PIPs.</p><ul><li><strong>Pythian Council</strong><ul><li>Eight members and the Operations Wallet holder are signers of the Pythian 7-of-9 multi-sig wallet.</li><li>Four members are replaced every election.</li><li>Can be delegated the power to vote on Operational PIPs that involve updates to the oracle program, verification mechanism, adjusting oracle update fees and denominations, and the management of PGAS (the gas token on Pythnet that is allocated/delegated to validators).</li></ul></li><li><strong>Price Feed Council</strong><ul><li>Seven members and the Operations Wallet holder are signers of the Price Feed 5-of-8 multi-sig wallet.</li><li>Three members are replaced every election.</li><li>Can be delegated the power to vote on Operational PIPs that involve managing the set of offered price feeds, the selection of publishers, and price feed requirements (i.e., minimum and maximum publishers per feed).</li></ul></li></ul><p>After discussions on Pyth’s forum on <a href="https://discord.gg/nE79EaQA">Discord</a>, PYTH holders can vote on proposals when they reach the “Voting Phase” via the governance portal on <a href="https://app.realms.today/dao/PYTH">Realms</a>, which currently <a href="https://app.realms.today/dao/PYTH/params">requires</a> proposers to hold 25 million PYTH to create a proposal.</p><p>Pyth DAO has two types of PIPs: Constitutional and Operational. Constitutional PIPs involve protocol updates, determining structure, and guiding the administration of the Pyth DAO. They require greater than 67% support for implementation. Operational PIPs involve elections and the management of the treasury, Pythian Council, and Price Feed Council. Voting on these PIPs can be delegated to Council members and require greater than 50% support for implementation.</p><h2>Pyth Usage</h2><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/e7f672835cb71eab6d6b7efa34c269c345d57967-3200x1800.png?w=800" /><p>Pyth is one of the most used protocols on Solana. Its oracle transactions accounted for an average of 20% of all transactions on Solana during February 2024. In this same time period, Pyth data providers paid $225,000 in fees on Solana. Pyth oracles secure 95% of the value on the blockchain. Pyth also secures over 90% of the value on 9 other blockchains and over 50% on 16 others, as of <a href="https://pyth.network/blog/where-pyth-is-now-looking-towards-2024">January 2024</a>.</p><h3>Notable Users</h3><p>Pyth has become one of the most widely used oracle protocols across an array of blockchains, thanks to its ability to scale feeds on Pythnet. Instead of adding new feeds to destination chains, it simply adds new feeds to Pythnet, which can be used by Pyth’s oracle contract on each destination chain it supports. Hence, Pyth can simply build an oracle contract for whatever chain it plans to expand to. With its growing support for many blockchains, various projects have adopted Pyth’s oracle network. A couple of notable projects are listed below.</p><p><strong>Synthetix</strong></p><p><a href="https://messari.io/report/synthetix-q4-2023-brief">Synthetix</a> is a decentralized liquidity provisioning protocol that enables the creation of synthetic assets, known as Synths, which track the value of crypto and real-world assets like currencies, commodities, and stocks. Synthetix allows users to gain exposure to various assets without actually holding them, thereby broadening investment opportunities and enhancing liquidity in the crypto market. A crucial component of Synthetix's functionality is its <a href="https://docs.synthetix.io/synthetix-protocol/the-synthetix-protocol/oracles">integration</a> with Pyth Network oracles. These oracles provide high-fidelity, real-time price feeds that are essential for maintaining the accuracy of the Synths' values.</p><p><strong>Helium</strong></p><p><a href="https://messari.io/report/helium-laying-the-foundation-for-a-telecom-network-deployment-platform">Helium</a> is a decentralized wireless Internet of Things (IoT) network. It incorporates token-economic incentives encouraging network participants to deploy wireless devices that provide mobile network coverage. Helium <a href="https://docs.helium.com/oracles/price-oracles">utilizes</a> Pyth Network oracles to provide precise onchain market prices for Helium's native token, HNT. These values are essential for a range of network activities, including the conversion of burned HNT into Data Credits (DC) and accurately measuring treasury allocations. Though Helium is not DeFi, using Pyth oracles in Helium’s decentralized connectivity platform highlights the importance of precise data in managing the economics of even <a href="https://messari.io/report/state-of-depin-2023">DePIN</a> protocols.</p><p><strong>Eclipse</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.eclipse.xyz/">Eclipse</a> recently <a href="https://www.theblock.co/post/281566/eclipse-labs-raises-50-million-in-series-a-funding-ahead-of-expected-q2-mainnet">raised $50 million</a> in a Series A round to launch the first Layer-2 blockchain that will use the SVM (Solana Virtual Machine) for execution and Celestia for data availability, all while deriving security from Ethereum as a settlement layer. The launch of Eclipse should attract liquidity from Ethereum users and route them to Solana-based decentralized applications across the Layer-2. As Solana’s leading oracle, Pyth will support many of the applications expanding to and launching on Eclipse.</p><h2>Competitive Analysis</h2><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/817677a4dcd2f4a2efeb65915724552cedb7ada8-3200x1800.png?w=800" /><p>The oracle landscape is a competitive sector that has been dominated by Chainlink. Though <a href="https://messari.io/report/web3-oracles-on-chronicle-protocol">Chronicle Protocol</a> created the first onchain oracle in 2017 for MakerDAO, it did not launch a public oracle network until late 2023. It currently only offers feeds on two blockchains, though it plans to expand. Chainlink captured market share in the developing years of DeFi, launching a variety of oracle-based products that serve a broad spectrum of markets. As of writing, only three protocols <a href="https://defillama.com/oracles">secure more value</a> than Pyth Network: Chainlink, Chronicle, and WINkLink — these top four protocols account for 90–95% of the TVS among oracles. That said, Pyth secures value on the largest number of blockchains. Chainlink is Pyth’s largest competitor in both the diversity of blockchains covered and value secured.</p><h3>Chainlink</h3><p>Critics have referred to Chainlink as a “<a href="https://blockworks.co/news/chronicle-protocol-oracle-black-box-problem">black box</a>” given the opaqueness of where oracle nodes source their data. Sources are not identified onchain nor on the websites of Chainlink oracle nodes. In contrast, each data point on Pyth Network can be traced back to the public keys of individual publishers by copying the transaction hash from Pyth’s <a href="https://pyth.network/price-feeds">Price Feed web page</a> to any Solana <a href="https://explorer.solana.com/">block explorer</a>. While data on Chainlink can also be traced back to Chainlink oracle nodes, Pyth data providers are first-party sources. Unlike Chainlink’s data, Pyth’s published data was sourced internally from their operations as an exchange, trading firm, market maker, etc. However, provider public keys are not publicly linked with their identity, which adds a layer of trust in how Pyth (which permissioned publishers originally) manages its publisher network.</p><p>While Pyth is singularly focused on traditional finance and crypto price feeds, Chainlink has several offerings. These include an interoperability protocol (<a href="https://chain.link/cross-chain">CCIP</a>), <a href="https://chain.link/proof-of-reserve">Proof of Reserve</a> feeds, and developer tooling (<a href="https://chain.link/vrf">VRFs</a>, <a href="https://chain.link/functions">API functions</a>, and <a href="https://chain.link/automation">automation services</a>), in addition to its <a href="https://chain.link/data-feeds">market data</a> feeds. Hence, Pyth’s primary product challenges Chainlink’s leading market data feed product — though Pyth also offers a random number generator through <a href="https://pyth.network/blog/secure-random-numbers-for-blockchains">Pyth Entropy</a>. The following is a comparison of the aspects of Pyth’s and Chainlink’s market data feeds:</p><p><strong>Data source</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Pyth</strong><ul><li>Pyth aggregates data directly from primary sources and updates price feeds on the Pythnet appchain and Solana every 400 ms.</li><li>Outside of Solana, other chains must initiate a price update for it to be published to the respective chain, implying that the staleness of data is between 400 ms and the next on-demand update.</li><li>There’s a potential conflict of interest for data publishers (that also trade) to publish honest data points that may be disadvantageous to particular trades. Assuming most publishers are honest, seek to maintain a high reputation, and do not coordinate updates, Pyth’s aggregation algorithm should mitigate this risk by applying a low weight to outlier data points.</li><li>Sourcing data directly from primary sources enables the quick addition of price feeds for newly created pairs.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Chainlink</strong><ul><li>Chainlink aggregates data from secondary sources (data aggregators) and publishes prices feed updates onchain where the frequency depends on the blockchain.</li><li>Staleness of a data point is dependent on secondary source updates and oracle network aggregation.</li><li>Though a primary source may support a particular trading pair, price feed availability depends on secondary aggregators also implementing coverage of that data point. This could add friction in adding new feeds, though this is not an issue with significant trading pairs.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Pull v. Push Model</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Pyth</strong><ul><li>Pyth on Solana uses a push model, publishing updates every 400 ms.</li><li>Pyth on Pythnet uses a pull model, where users initiate an update on the destination chain, published updates on Pythnet are routed through Wormhole, and updates are published to the requesting chain. The users incur costs in this model.</li><li>Because all market price feeds (outside Solana) are on Pythnet, Pyth offers increased scalability that reduces the costs and time to integrate feeds directly on supported/new chains. However, Pyth’s scalability introduces latency and an added layer of trust/reliance on Wormhole.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Chainlink</strong><ul><li>Chainlink’s primary market feeds use a push model, publishing updates often at the block times of destination chains. This can be costly to the oracle nodes and can cause update transactions to fail in high-volatility environments (though rare).</li><li>Adding price feeds to new and existing chains is more costly, as new price feeds must be implemented for each supported network.</li><li>Not reliant on an additional relayer, and does not add trust between Chainlink’s oracle network and destination blockchains.</li><li>Chainlink also offers a pull model in its <a href="https://data.chain.link/streams">Data Streams</a> product.</li><li>Similar data process to push model, except data is delivered to Chainlink’s offchain Data Engine, which delivers price updates when data is requested onchain.</li><li>Currently, Data Streams are only on Arbitrum and maintain eight price feeds.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Usage</strong></p><ul><li>Pyth <a href="https://defillama.com/oracles">secures</a> $5.5 billion on 162 protocols across <a href="https://pyth.network/blog/pyth-price-feeds-launch-on-hedera">50+ blockchains</a>.</li><li>Chainlink <a href="https://defillama.com/oracles">secures</a> $38.7 billion on 371 protocols across <a href="https://defillama.com/oracles">19 blockchains</a>.</li></ul><p>Both systems offer advantages and disadvantages in market data feeds. Pyth’s model is better equipped to scale the number of price feeds and maintain high update frequency. However, Pyth’s ability to maintain high-fidelity data depends on the assumption that the costs of reputation and collusion outweigh any profitable, malicious actions that could benefit publishers. And its network stability relies on Wormhole's uptime. Conversely, Chainlink’s model requires less trust in original data sources and between the oracle network and supported blockchains, given it pulls from secondary aggregation sources and publishes directly to destination chains. However, scaling data feeds and reaching a wider breadth of blockchains is more costly. Regardless, as crypto continues to grow, new protocols will have many options and tradeoffs/risks to consider in implementing different oracle price feeds.</p><h2>Closing Summary</h2><p>Pyth Network is a novel protocol that has changed the oracle landscape. It fosters a network of first-party data publishers and implements a pull-based oracle that offloads fees to oracle users. With this design, Pyth cuts costs for the oracle network, increases price update frequency, and secures direct market data based directly on primary data sources. Since launching, Pyth has grown to serve the largest number of blockchains and accounts for the fourth-largest amount of total value secured ($5.5 billion as of March 2024). As it grows its publisher network, Pyth is well-positioned to achieve its mission of making all of the world’s financial market data available to Web3.</p><p>——</p></div>

Polkadot was built using the <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk">Polkadot SDK</a>, a blockchain development framework. Furthermore, Polkadot’s base layer is known as the <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-architecture#relay-chain">Relay Chain</a>, which employs a <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-consensus#nominated-proof-of-stake">Nominated Proof-of-Stake (NPoS)</a> consensus mechanism, and its state machine is compiled to <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-wasm">WebAssembly (Wasm)</a>.</p><p><br />Polkadot's governance transitioned to the <a href="https://polkadot.network/features/opengov/">OpenGov</a> model on June 15, 2023, marking a significant evolution from its original <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-governance#:~:text=Polkadot%20uses%20a%20sophisticated%20governance,can%20always%20command%20the%20network.">Gov V1</a> framework. This new model has enhanced the platform's governance by introducing mechanisms that have led to a higher frequency of referenda, an increase in Treasury activities, and a greater level of decentralization. This report will delve into the details of Polkadot’s governance, providing a comprehensive comparison between the original Gov V1 and the OpenGov model. It will also analyze the impact of these governance changes on the network.</p><p></p><h2>Polkadot Governance V1</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>The initial governance framework of Polkadot, <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-governance#:~:text=Polkadot%20uses%20a%20sophisticated%20governance,can%20always%20command%20the%20network.">Governance V1</a>, centered around three core bodies: the Council, the Technical Committee, and the Referendum Chamber. These groups collectively supported the network's finances, technology, and other miscellaneous developments. This structure facilitated a balanced approach to decision-making and operations, engaging various stakeholders in the governance process.</p><h3>Stakeholders</h3><p>The roles of Gov V1 stakeholders were as follows:</p><ul><li><a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-governance#council"><strong>Council</strong></a>: Composed of 13 members, the Council's responsibilities included managing proposals, canceling referenda, and electing the Technical Committee. </li><li><a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-governance#technical-committee"><strong>Technical Committee</strong></a>: Formed by key Polkadot developers and selected by the Council, the Technical Committee was tasked with blocking harmful proposals and expediting necessary fixes and updates. </li><li><a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-governance#technical-committee"><strong>Referendum Chamber</strong></a>: This chamber included all DOT token-holders engaged in the governance process by staking, endorsing, or delegating their tokens to gain voting rights. </li></ul><p></p><p>Funding for the Polkadot ecosystem was managed through the <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-treasury">Treasury</a> in Gov V1. The Treasury accumulated resources from block rewards and transaction fees. Spending proposals required Council approval and a waiting period of 28 days. </p><h3>Process</h3><p></p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/2d087b0bc2d520daae1d2a89881670f526bb08a7-6400x3572.png?w=800" /><p>The Polkadot Gov V1 governance process was structured to engage token holders actively in the network's evolution. The process is outlined as follows:<br /></p><ol><li><strong>Proposal Submission and Endorsement</strong>: Any party could initiate proposals. These were then queued and required endorsements to progress. The most supported proposal was moved forward for voting.</li><li><strong>Referendum and Voting</strong>: The voting cycle alternated between public proposals and those put forward by the Council, incorporating emergency fast-tracks and token-boosted delegated voting.</li><li><strong>Council and Treasury Involvement</strong>: The Council played a key role in managing Treasury funds, proposing, and evaluating proposals.</li><li><strong>Adaptive Quorum Biasing</strong>: Voting thresholds were adjusted dynamically based on turnout and the source of proposals.</li><li><strong>Proposal Enactment</strong>: Passed referenda, subject to a waiting period, alternated between public and council proposals.</li></ol><p></p><h2>Polkadot OpenGov</h2><h3>Overview</h3><p>The Polkadot ecosystem <a href="https://polkadot.network/newsroom/press-releases/polkadot-hands-decision-making-powers-to-its-community-with-opengov-launch">rolled out</a> <a href="https://polkadot.network/features/opengov/">OpenGov</a> on June 15, 2023. This model places the community at the center of decision-making processes and eliminates any control from Parity Technologies and Web3 Foundation.</p><p><a href="https://messari.io/report/state-of-polkadot-q1-2023?referrer=asset:polkadot">Referenda</a> in the OpenGov system undergo a structured life cycle for enactment, including the Lead-in Period for proposal submission, the Decision Period for voting and approval, and the Enactment Period for execution. OpenGov allows multiple referenda to run concurrently, allowing for the faster passage of motions.</p><p>In the OpenGov framework, the traditional roles of the Council and Technical Committee have evolved into the <a href="https://messari.io/report/state-of-polkadot-q1-2023?referrer=asset:polkadot">Fellowship</a>, which provides deep technical expertise without special voting powers. Functioning as a developer DAO, it champions decentralization through advocating community-based voting along with rigorous checks and balances. Membership to the Fellowship is open to all who qualify, marking a departure from the exclusive council system. This model also commits to <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-polkadot-technical-fellowship">paying developers</a> for their contributions to Polkadot. Furthermore, it introduces a novel delegation mechanism, empowering users to allocate their voting power by conviction and token commitment.</p><p></p><h3>Stakeholders</h3><p>The OpenGov stakeholders’ roles are as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>DOT Tokenholders</strong>: DOT tokenholders are at the heart of the OpenGov system and carry the primary responsibility for governance decisions. This includes voting on proposals, delegating voting rights, and actively participating in shaping the network's future. The direct democracy model empowers every tokenholder to have a say in the governance process, democratizing the decision-making and making the system more reflective of the community's collective will.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/polkadot-fellows"><strong>Polkadot Technical Fellowship</strong></a>: As the new technical advisory body, the Fellowship plays a crucial role in guiding the technical direction of the Polkadot network. They are responsible for reviewing technical proposals and ensuring that changes and updates to the network are sound, secure, and aligned with Polkadot's long-term vision.</li></ul><p>This evolution in governance roles under OpenGov illustrates a strategic move towards a more participatory and technically robust decision-making process, aligning closely with the ethos of decentralized and democratic blockchain governance.</p><h3>Process</h3><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/c8f086f84fc678a83e7b41db2760cd9967cdcccb-6432x3604.png?w=800" /><p>OpenGov introduces a nuanced and dynamic system for proposal submission, evaluation, and enactment:</p><p><strong>1. Proposal Submission and Evaluation</strong>:</p><ul><li>Public Initiation: In OpenGov, all proposals originate from the public, emphasizing community-driven governance.</li><li>Lead-in Period: After submission, proposals enter a lead-in period, a preparatory phase that ensures proposals are thoroughly considered before moving forward.</li><li>Assignment to Tracks: Proposals are categorized into one of fifteen Tracks based on their nature and requirements, each with a distinct Origin determining the referendum's duration and voting capacity.<strong>Tracks and Origins</strong>:</li><li>Diverse Tracks for Varied Proposals: Tracks like Small Tipper or Big Spender categorize Treasury proposals by funding amount, ensuring appropriate handling.</li><li>Expedited Processing: The Polkadot Technical Fellowship can fast-track proposals via a Whitelist Caller origin, streamlining the review and voting processes.</li></ul><p><strong>2. Voting and Approval Process</strong>:</p><ul><li>Simultaneous Voting Across Tracks: OpenGov permits concurrent voting on proposals across different tracks, adhering to capacity limits to ensure manageable decision-making.</li><li>Multi-Role Delegations: Voters can delegate their voting power to experts in specific tracks, optimizing governance participation without requiring constant engagement from all tokenholders.</li></ul><p><strong>3. Mechanisms for Control and Correction</strong>:</p><ul><li>Cancellation and Blacklisting: OpenGov allows the community to cancel ongoing referenda or blacklist proposals, preventing them from re-entering the queue. This feature is essential for managing malicious or spam proposals.</li></ul><p><strong>4. Detailed Governance Stages</strong>:</p><ul><li>Creation and Lead-in: Proposals must satisfy origin-specific criteria, including a deposit to manage spam and capacity.</li><li>Decision Period: Proposals advance to voting, where they must meet predefined approval and support criteria to pass.</li><li>Enactment Period: Successful proposals undergo an enactment period before the changes are implemented, allowing the network to prepare for the transition.</li></ul><p><strong>5. Additional Governance Elements</strong>:</p><ul><li>Origin and Track Dynamics: Each proposal's path is determined by its Origin and Track, with specific parameters for decision-making and enactment tailored to its impact.</li><li>Multiplier Feature: Tokenholders can amplify their voting power through token locking, with the conviction multiplier increasing based on the lock period.</li><li>Approval and Support Mechanisms: Proposals require meeting approval and support thresholds within a confirmation period to progress, ensuring broad consensus for enactment.</li></ul><p><strong>6. Strategic Voting and Proposal Management</strong>:</p><ul><li>Approval and Support Thresholds: A sophisticated system evaluates proposal viability through approval and support metrics, adjusting to ensure proposals have substantial backing.</li><li>Dynamic Confirmation Period: The confirmation period's flexibility allows for re-evaluating proposals based on shifting voter sentiment, maintaining governance integrity</li></ul><p>Polkadot's OpenGov system introduces a governance model that balances community input, expert evaluation, and strategic decision-making. Through its stages, multi-tiered voting system, and mechanisms for correction and control, OpenGov empowers the Polkadot community to actively shape the network's evolution in a structured and effective manner.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/20bc2470696e15dba1934b984fb754e0322b7cff-6400x3572.png?w=800" /><h2>Data</h2><p>This data is sourced from the Parity Data Team’s <a href="https://twitter.com/dotlake_xyz">DotLake</a> platform, a data lake containing offchain and onchain data on the Polkadot ecosystem.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/9b33e69b0fdf40253a9d884b8be42214ac7d6bc0-6400x3600.png?w=800" /><p>Following the transition to OpenGov, a significant increase in platform engagement has been observed. The average number of votes has risen by 1,981% compared to Gov V1. This trend extends to referenda, which have seen a 1,008% increase in participation after the transition. Notably, 40% of referenda under OpenGov were not approved, in contrast to a 9% rejection rate under Gov V1. This indicates a shift towards a wider range of voting behaviors and outcomes, suggesting that OpenGov fosters a more diverse and dynamic governance environment than its predecessor.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/36717088dc409dda25283bbd8474d652116bcec5-6400x3600.png?w=800" /><p>Since the introduction of OpenGov, the number of Treasury proposal submissions has significantly exceeded those made through Gov V1. Gov V1 recorded 83 proposals before OpenGov’s implementation, while OpenGov received 401 proposals (+405%). This transition resulted in an average monthly increase of 126% in proposals submitted to OpenGov, which now represents 80% of all treasury proposals. OpenGov proposals peaked in November 2023 with 92.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/5527d7e9a504253e5ddfa39f262c922b63cce37d-6400x3600.png?w=800" /><p>Between June 2023 and January 2024, the counts of direct and delegated voters in the Polkadot governance system were closely matched, with 66,602 direct voters and 65,508 delegated voters recorded. Initially, direct voting was the more popular method following the launch of OpenGov, but over time, the trend shifted towards an increasing preference for delegated voting. December 2023 experienced the highest voter turnout in the latter half of the year, which could be attributed to year-end voting activities. This trend towards delegated voting indicates a clear preference that is expected to maintain or increase governance participation over time.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/b1a5451ed20ed6160f2fc62e6af7e42039b6d51b-6400x3600.png?w=800" /><p>Outflows from the Polkadot Treasury have seen a steady increase. The primary outflows are from <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-polkadot-opengov-treasury#bounties">bounties</a> and proposals. Both bounties and proposals saw increases in the second half of 2023, with bounties increasing 18% and proposals increasing 116%.<br /></p><h2>Closing Summary</h2><p>Polkadot's governance underwent a significant evolution with the transition to OpenGov in June 2023. The shift aimed to enhance community involvement through new mechanisms like replacing the Council and Technical Committee with the Fellowship and introducing a more dynamic proposal system. Thus far, OpenGov has accomplished its mission with referenda and votes each up over 1,000% through six months, treasury proposals up over 405%, and both direct and delegated voters increasing.</p><p>Overall, this new governance model has boosted platform engagement and governance participation. These changes underscore Polkadot's commitment to fostering a participatory and responsive ecosystem.</p></div>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。在一场众议院农业委员会听证会上，CFTC主席Behnam敦促国会关闭加密商品现货市场的监管漏洞，并重申CFTC的立场，即ETH是一种商品。在参议院，美联储主席杰罗姆·鲍威尔告诉银行业委员会成员，美联储永远不会直接向个人发行CBDC，只会通过银行进行，而且只会在明确得到国会授权的情况下才会这样做。此外，能源信息管理局同意停止对商业加密矿工进行的“紧急”数据收集，销毁已经收集的数据。它现在将遵循传统的通知和评论期流程。 <div>
<p>At a House Ag hearing, CFTC Chair Behnam urged Congress to close the regulatory gap in the crypto commodity spot market and reaffirmed the CFTC's position that ETH is a commodity. In the Senate, Fed Chair Jerome Powell told Senate Banking Committee members that the Fed would never issue a CBDC directly to individuals, only through banks, and would only do so with clear Congressional authorization. Also, the Energy Information Administration agreed to stop its "emergency" data collection from commercial crypto miners, destroy the data it had already collected. It will now follow the traditional notice and comment period process.</p>

This set of enhancements covers multiple areas including protocol architecture, tokenomics, and governance.</p><p>The core <a href="https://polygon.technology/blog/introducing-polygon-2-0-the-value-layer-of-the-internet">vision</a> of Polygon 2.0 is to build an aggregated blockchain network that enables unlimited scalability and unified liquidity through the integration of zero-knowledge (ZK) technology. This upgrade aims to address the inherent scaling challenges faced by Web3, where the addition of new chains often results in fragmented liquidity and an underwhelming user experience.</p><h2><strong>Aggregation Layer (AggLayer)</strong></h2><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/bdb7cbf18259beb1deabd838fc6a4ad38bee069c-602x300.png?w=800" /><p>In January 2024, Polygon Labs released <a href="https://polygon.technology/blog/aggregated-blockchains-a-new-thesis">information</a> about the AggLayer within the Polygon ecosystem, addressing challenges in blockchain architectures by unifying the liquidity and state of ZK-secured chains. The AggLayer enables "near-instant atomic cross-chain transactions" and aims to unify liquidity across its ecosystem. Developers can connect any EVM L1 or L2 to the AggLayer. This allows the chains to "maintain full sovereignty" while enabling them to access a larger pool of liquidity, aggregated users, and dApps. The first version of AggLayer is scheduled for release in February 2024.

The tokenized and gaming features leveraged by The Sandbox are listed below.</p><ul><li>SAND — an ERC-20 token and digital in-game currency used for purchases, monetization, and asset creation</li><li>LAND — digital ownable land within The Sandbox virtual world</li><li>ESTATE — a combination of LANDs to create a larger plot</li><li>ASSET — assets created using the VoxEdit application that are converted to ERC-1155 tokens when uploaded to The Sandbox marketplace</li><li>AVATARS — ERC-721 tokens that are playable characters within The Sandbox virtual world</li><li>CATALYST — tokens burnt to define an ASSETs tier/scarcity</li><li>Game Maker — a <a href="https://gamemaker.sandbox.game/#/en/a">toolbox</a> that enables users to create 3D games and experiences in The Sandbox virtual world</li><li>VoxEdit — software used to create and animate equipment and other types of gaming assets</li><li>Game Client — enables players to play experiences created with the Game Maker</li></ul><p>The Sandbox provides Roblox-esque gameplay with digital ownership and more robust in-game economics due to the tradeable nature of the SAND token and the other assets within the Sandbox virtual world.</p><p>Sandbox offers a variety of in-game NFTs as well as user-generated NFTs. The VoxEdit NFT builder is used for creating 3D objects (ASSETs) such as characters, equipment, wearables, and art.</p><p>The Sandbox was initially launched as a <a href="https://www.pixowl.com/games/the-sandbox/">2D mobile game in 2012</a> by the software development company <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/pixowl/">Pixowl</a>. Pixowl was founded in 2011 by Arthur Madrid and Sebastien Borget. The mobile game iteration of Sandbox accumulated more than <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2020/03/19/the-sandbox-raises-2-million-more-to-build-out-blockchain-based-game-world/">40 million downloads</a> by April 2018. In May 2018, The Sandbox <a href="https://www.pixowl.com/gamesposts/animoca-brands-acquires-pixowl-world-building-developer-of-the-sandbox/">rebranded</a> as a 3D metaverse game and blockchain-focused development began. In August 2018, Pixowl and The Sandbox were <a href="https://www.pixowl.com/gamesposts/animoca-brands-acquires-pixowl-world-building-developer-of-the-sandbox/">acquired by Animoca Brands</a>, a gaming-focused software development company and VC Fund.</p><p><a href="https://www.sandbox.game/en/">Website</a> / <a href="https://twitter.com/TheSandboxGame">X (Twitter)</a> / <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vAe4zvY">Discord</a></p><h2>Network Overview</h2><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/e7bea12c089753af07a5179e25e542492ae4560e-7296x4060.png?w=800" /><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/2c1d2efd0ee4cbc0e98afc20ffddc819b1c9c3f8-720x405.png?w=800" /><p>SAND staking is conducted on the Polygon network and involves two staking pools: one for LAND owners and one for everyone else. LAND owners can stake up to 2,000 SAND per LAND asset in this pool. In the other pool, any SAND holder can stake their SAND, though LAND owners receive a multiplier based on the number of LANDs they own.</p><p>Daily average SAND staked was down 8% QoQ, from 110.2 million to 101.7 million. By the end of Q4, 23.8 million SAND was staked in the LAND pool, and 74.8 million SAND was staked in the non-LAND owners pool. The amount of SAND staked by LAND owners decreased by 7% QoQ, but the amount of SAND staked in the non-LAND owners pool actually increased by 1% QoQ. Additionally, the percentage of circulating supply of SAND staked fell by 11% QoQ from 5.5% to 4.9%.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/0a2dcb0601f7dca8eb1f65d0fe77d345eac197b9-720x405.png?w=800" /><p>The decrease in SAND staked throughout 2023 also coincided with lower SAND staking rewards. In Q4 of last year, 5.6 million SAND was distributed as staking rewards. In Q4, this number fell by 82% to 1 million SAND. However, over the same time period, the daily average amount of SAND staked only fell by 9% from 112.2 million. This dynamic suggests that The Sandbox may have been overcompensating stakers earlier in the year.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/78c7ede648109c0af51cc6ffc68144195dd0f06a-720x405.png?w=800" /><p>Non-LAND minting activity bounced back in Q4, totaling 30,194 mints (up 233% QoQ) for the entire quarter. This also lead to a YoY increase of 246%. Popular non-LAND mints in Q4 included Avatars from the <a href="https://www.sandbox.game/avatar-collections/captain-laserhawk?utm_source=thesandboxtwitter&amp;utm_campaign=captainlaserhawk&amp;utm_medium=_5651876&amp;gsid=1eeb57c8344c64f69c2736f1f18fd449&amp;gsc=1">Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix</a>, <a href="https://www.sandbox.game/avatar-collections/extraordinary-attorney-woo/en/">Extraordinary Attorney Woo</a>, and <a href="https://www.sandbox.game/avatar-collections/big-poppa-collection/en/">THE NOTORIOUS B.I.G. Big Poppa</a> collections. As for LAND items, they experienced a downtrend in Q4. After an impressive 3,719 LAND mints in Q3, LAND mints fell by 59% QoQ to 1,536 in Q4.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/23d6939113317faa0b33d5404e8852c5be6406dc-720x405.png?w=800" /><p>Activity on The Sandbox is conducted through digital real estate called LAND NFTs. Content creators can host metaverse experiences on plots of LAND. As such, LAND is valued highly amongst all The Sandbox NFTs. While non-LAND NFTs are valued lower, they are still necessary for various types of activities in The Sandbox metaverse (e.g., CATALYSTS to create ASSETS and give them attributes).</p><p>With a difference in general monetary value, LAND is harder to acquire (at a 0.33 ETH floor on <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/sandbox/analytics">OpenSea</a> as of December 31), lowering the buyer pool. Non-LAND assets are priced lower (at a 0.0001 ETH floor on <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/the-sandbox-assets/activity?search[sortAscending]=true&amp;search[sortBy]=UNIT_PRICE&amp;search[toggles][0]=BUY_NOW">OpenSea</a> as of December 31), drawing a larger pool of buyers. These differences were accentuated by poor NFT market conditions in 2023, potentially contributing to the number of active LAND buyers falling (down 20% QoQ) and to active non-LAND buyers increasing (up 73% QoQ).</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/80d53cdb52d7402410f4922dd40b771d0da62ce8-720x405.png?w=800" /><p>The secondary sale volume measures the USD amounts for The Sandbox assets that were sold on secondary exchanges like OpenSea and LooksRare.</p><p>Daily average secondary volume for LAND increased by 11% QoQ, from $19,100 to $21,300. The daily average for secondary sales of LAND also increased by 19% QoQ, from 30 to 35. As such, the remaining active buyers demonstrated a willingness to spend larger amounts of money on LAND, even though the number of active LAND buyers decreased in Q4.</p><p>Alongside the number of active buyers for non-LAND items increasing in Q4, the daily average secondary volume for non-LAND items increased by 78% from $1,900 to $3,400. Furthermore, the daily average for sales also increased by 173% QoQ from 64 to 176.</p><h2>Financial Overview</h2><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/53243d5d4b01c99b3aafeeca027a0ba0b73d0310-7296x4060.png?w=800" /><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/d73dc92e6c11f01a803a5824475f4a690c9cdaa7-720x405.png?w=800" /><p>Q4 was a strong quarter for SAND’s price performance, as its circulating market cap increased by 89% QoQ from $649.9 million to $1.2 billion. This increase was largely attributable to the price increase of SAND, up 86% QoQ from $0.31 to $0.58. Additionally, SAND outperformed the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/global-charts">total market cap</a> of all cryptocurrencies, which gained 54% in Q4. Comparatively, SAND also outperformed gaming peer MANA (up 68% QoQ), but it slightly underperformed AXS (up 92% QoQ) and GALA (up 98% QoQ).</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/8ac00ffbcb8b85c6d0c4575977458bc05f5180b5-720x405.png?w=800" /><p>The total primary sale volume measures the USD amounts for which assets from The Sandbox were sold. The Sandbox company retains the earnings from primary sales. The Sandbox conducts five different types of primary sales: public non-LAND, public LAND, private LAND, private ESTATE, and private Auction.</p><p>In total, primary sales volume was down 47% QoQ, decreasing from $1.38 million to $739,000. In nominal terms, primary LAND sales volume fell the most, decreasing by $409,000 QoQ (down 55% QoQ). In percentage terms, Auction volume fell the most, decreasing by 69% QoQ (down $24,000 QoQ).</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/bf26cbdf9176bcba5a66c47a1d74100d7b3ffc0e-720x405.png?w=800" /><p>The Sandbox’s breakdown of primary sales volume was consistently changing throughout 2023. In Q1, the biggest driver of primary sales volume was private LAND sales. By Q4, however, public LAND sales had become the largest driver, representing 44% of all primary sales volume. Categories that saw an increase in share of primary sales volume in Q4 included non-LAND sales (up 43% QoQ to 29%) and private LAND sales (up 19% QoQ to 11%). Categories that saw a decrease included Auction sales (down 43% QoQ to 1%), public LAND sales (down 17% QoQ to 44%), and Estate sales (down 4% to 14%).</p><p>Total revenue is the sum of the total primary sale volume and total royalty revenue. Royalty Revenue for an individual secondary sale varies from 0 to 5%.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/f9a934d2c43c11c3529db5a9b65696dc661e44cb-720x405.png?w=800" /><p>Total revenue was down 42% QoQ, from $1.4 million in Q3 to $839,000 in Q4. This drop was primarily due to the decrease in primary sales volume, as that is the largest driver of revenue for The Sandbox. Despite the fall in revenue, royalty revenue picked up in Q4. Royalty revenue from LAND sales increased from $51,000 to $95,000, an 87% QoQ increase. Non-LAND royalty revenue was down slightly, down 12% QoQ from $6,000 to $5,000.</p><h2>Qualitative Analysis</h2><p>Q4’23 marked another busy quarter for The Sandbox, highlighted by various events, partnerships, integrations, and updates.
