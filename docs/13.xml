<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章介绍了Cardano创始人查尔斯·霍金森在周末就项目的各种关切和谣言进行了回应。他澄清了关于Hydra项目、合作伙伴关系以及区块链的整体扩展策略的各种问题。霍金森驳斥了有关Hydra项目被放弃的传言，并提供了对DISH合作伙伴关系、ERC20转换器、埃塞俄比亚活动、蒙古合作伙伴关系等事项的更新。他还详细介绍了Cardano的扩展计划，并强调了Cardano项目的抗压性和对创始原则的承诺。此外，霍金森还对World Mobile合作伙伴关系进行了澄清，强调了该项目的宏伟目标以及合作链的重要性。最后，霍金森的讨论不仅提供了对流传的FUD的反驳，还重申了Cardano的战略方向和坚实基础。 <div>
<p>In a series of messages over the weekend, Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, addressed various concerns and rumors circulating about the project, specifically regarding the development of Hydra, partnerships, and the overall scaling strategy for the blockchain.</p>
<h2>Cardano Founder Debunks FUD</h2>
<p>Hoskinson <a href="https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">began</a> by addressing rumors that the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-founder-debunks-hydra-scaling-issues/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Hydra protocol</a> had been abandoned, labeling such claims as baseless fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). &#8220;I&#8217;m seeing some videos claiming that Hydra has been abandoned. It is just pure FUD. The team has never been more productive and motivated, there is great community engagement and new papers on the way for enhancements to the protocol,&#8221; Hoskinson stated. He directed those curious about the project to the official Hydra website for the latest information.</p>
<p>When confronted with a barrage of questions regarding the timeline for various initiatives such as the DISH partnership, the ERC20 converter, activities in Ethiopia, other <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-strengthen-its-ecosystem-africa-partnership/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">African ventures</a>, and a partnership in Mongolia, Hoskinson provided a comprehensive update.</p>

<p>He highlighted the successful deployment of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/game-on-cardano-erc-20-convertor-coming-soon-to-testnet/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">ERC20 converter</a>, which facilitated <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-backed-singularitynet-sets-in-switzerland/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">SingularityNET</a>&#8216;s transition to Cardano, making it a billion-dollar asset. Hoskinson further noted, “Our Africa work continues through John via the RealFi company, we successfully trained developers in Mongolia and concluded pilots with all the entities mentioned. Sorry, try again.”</p>
<p>Further addressing queries about scaling Cardano, Hoskinson encouraged viewers to watch a detailed video that outlines Cardano&#8217;s preparedness for scaling challenges in a decentralized, secure, and high-integrity manner. He underscored Cardano&#8217;s achievements, including over 2300 days of continuous operation, as evidence of the project&#8217;s resilience and commitment to its founding principles.</p>
<p>“Cardano is best positioned to meet these challenges in a decentralized, secure, and high integrity way. Never forget what we&#8217;ve accomplished together with over 2300+ days uptime 24/7 while maintaining our principles,” Hoskinson said.</p>
<h2>Clarifications On The World Mobile Partnership</h2>
<p>Regarding the skepticism and negativity directed towards Cardano, Hoskinson <a href="https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1769452455257845806" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">speculated</a>, &#8220;Man, it&#8217;s raining FUD this weekend, and I&#8217;m not sure about the origin. I guess it&#8217;s that time of the cycle where everyone freaks out about Cardano&#8217;s potential and roadmap, so they throw a wave of FUD at us.&#8221;</p>

<p>He provided insights into the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-africa-special-iog-partners-with-world-mobile-to-connect-250k-people/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">partnership with World Mobile</a>, emphasizing the project&#8217;s ambitious goals. &#8220;No current system in the entire blockchain ecosystem is capable or has technology to resolve a project at this scale involving billions of users. That&#8217;s why World Mobile is building it,&#8221; Hoskinson explained.</p>
<p>Clarifying misconceptions about partnerchains, Hoskinson emphasized that they are indeed part of Cardano, contrary to some community misunderstandings. Partnerchains are designed to allow for the development of hypercomplex projects with unique protocols, such as different consensus mechanisms, ledger rules, and transaction semantics. He pointed out that this flexibility is crucial for projects like World Mobile and decentralized social networks, aiming to connect the unconnected through a decentralized network with equal and fair rules.</p>
<p>Hoskinson&#8217;s discourse over the weekend provided not only rebuttals to the circulating FUD but also reaffirmed the strategic direction and robust foundation upon which Cardano is building its future. His statements reinforce the commitment of the Cardano team to scale the network securely and sustainably while pushing the boundaries of blockchain technology&#8217;s potential.</p>
<p>At press time, ADA traded at $0.696.</p>

<title>Who Moved 1 Trillion Shiba Inu Tokens? Huge Transfer Raises Eyebrows</title>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。文章首先介绍了Shiba Inu（SHIB）代币数量巨大的转移，引发了市场震荡和投资者的猜测。接着讨论了Shiba Inu社区对即将推出的Shiba Eternity游戏的激动和期望。随后描述了SHIB市场的不确定性，包括价格波动和清算激增。最后提到尽管SHIB价格过去一个月呈现强劲增长，但最近的大量代币转移给Gate.io投下了一丝不确定的阴影，使SHIB社区感到紧张。 <div>
<p>Cryptocurrency markets witnessed seismic activity as Whale Alert, a leading service tracking large crypto transactions, reported a monumental transfer of Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens. A staggering 1 trillion SHIB, equivalent to $28,814,000, was observed in transit from an undisclosed wallet to the portals of Gate.io, a major cryptocurrency exchange.</p>

<p>The colossal transfer sent shockwaves through the crypto community, prompting intense speculation about its implications. While the sender&#8217;s identity remains a mystery, such massive movements to exchanges often signal imminent sales or significant trading activity. This revelation injected a surge of volatility into the SHIB market, leaving traders on edge.</p>

<p></p>
<h2><strong>Game Development Excitement Amid Market Uncertainty</strong></h2>
<p>Amidst the tumult, excitement within the Shiba Inu community soared as updates on the highly anticipated Shiba Eternity game emerged. During a recent AMA session on Discord, Shytoshi Kusama, the visionary behind the Shiba Inu ecosystem, made a significant announcement.</p>
<p>Departing from his usual cryptic responses, Kusama revealed plans for beta testing of the play-to-earn (P2E) version of the game in the upcoming quarter.</p>

<p></p>
<p>The announcement ignited hopes for a transformative development within the ecosystem. With anticipation building as the countdown to beta testing begins, SHIB holders eagerly await the opportunity to immerse themselves in the world of Shiba Eternity.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-287639" height="386" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_8344f6.png?resize=650%2C386" width="650" /></p>

<h2><strong>Navigating Uncertainty Amid Liquidation Surge</strong></h2>
<p>As the SHIB market grappled with uncertainty, investors faced a tumultuous landscape of fluctuating prices and heightened liquidations. In the past 24 hours, SHIB experienced a <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/shiba-inu" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">significant downturn</a>, with prices plummeting by 14.27%.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/UuMIqmgN/" width="1835" /></p>

<p>Adding to market jitters, data from CoinGlass revealed a surge in liquidations totaling a staggering $5,280,000. Of this amount, $4,080,000 stemmed from long liquidations, while $1,200,000 resulted from short liquidations.</p>

<strong>Shiba Inu Shows Resilience</strong>
<p>Despite the recent dip, SHIB has demonstrated <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-active-addresses-soar-over-170/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">remarkable resilience</a> over the past month, boasting a staggering 194% increase following a substantial rally. However, the influx of SHIB tokens to Gate.io has cast a shadow of doubt over the market&#8217;s stability, leaving the SHIB community on edge.</p>

<title>Nigeria SEC To Hike VASP Registration Fees Under New Regime – Details</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/nigeria-sec-to-hike-vasp-registration-fees-under/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/nigeria-sec-to-hike-vasp-registration-fees-under/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是消极的。尼日利亚证券与交易委员会提议提高虚拟资产服务提供商（VASP）获得经营许可的注册费用。新的规定还包括对加密行业关键方面的其他变化。VASP注册费将增加400％，从30百万元到150百万元。此外，加密交易所和交易平台现在需要支付更高的申请费和处理费。最低实收资本也提高到10亿奈拉，必须存在于银行余额、固定资产或某些证券投资中。最后，尼日利亚政府与知名加密交易所币安存在分歧，使得尼日利亚的加密领域备受关注。当前加密市场总市值为2.52万亿美元，比前一天下跌了4.23％，而比特币价格也出现了持续调整，目前交易价为66275.63美元。 <div>
<p>Nigeria&#8217;s Securities and Exchange Commission has proposed to raise the registration fees for virtual asset service providers (VASP) seeking an operational license. This development is accompanied by other changes in the regulations governing the key aspects of the crypto industry in the West African country.</p>

<h2>VASP Registration Fees In Nigeria To Rise By 400%</h2>
<p>On March 15, the Nigerian SEC released a<a href="https://sec.gov.ng/proposed-major-amendment-to-the-rules-on-issuance-offering-platforms-and-custody-of-digital-assets-to-stakeholders-and-the-general-public/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> set of proposed amendments</a> to its Rules on Digital Assets Issuance, Offering Platforms, Exchange, and Custody. According to the securities regulator, the suggested changes are aimed at providing more regulatory clarity to a rapidly developing crypto market as well as implementing feedback from industry players following recent discussions with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). </p>
<p>Of all the updated regulations, a quintupling increase in VASP registration fees from 30 million ($18,841.75) to 150 million ($94,208.76) has been a major talking point as such policies are usually viewed as a means of discouraging business participation, in this case, the emergence of new crypto exchanges. Meanwhile, it could also function as a protective mechanism, thus ensuring that only sturdy and well-funded parties are able to operate as VASPs.</p>
<p>Furthermore, crypto exchanges and trading platforms would now be expected to pay an application fee and processing fee of 300,000 naira ($188.42) and 1,000,000 naira ($628.06) as opposed to previous values of 100,000 ($62.81) and 300,000 ($188.42) respectively. </p>
<p>In addition, the country&#8217;s regulator has also raised the minimum paid-up capital for these businesses to 1,000,000,000 naira ($628,058.40) which must be set in bank balances, fixed assets, or as an investment in certain securities. Meanwhile, there will be a fidelity bond covering up to 25% of this minimum paid-up capital in line with the Commission’s existing rules and regulations. </p>

<h2>The Nigerian Crypto Space And Its Troubles</h2>
<p>Lately, Nigeria has been among major crypto headlines due to an ongoing squabble with prominent crypto exchange Binance. The government of the West African nation has accused Binance of playing a significant role in the devaluation of Nigerian Naira, demanding compensation to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/nigeria-fines-binance-10-billion/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">the tune of $10 billion. </a></p>
<p>This accusation has been accompanied by the Nigerian government making other demands of Binance in terms of user data and reportedly<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/nigeria-detains-binances-crypto-crime-investigator/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> detaining two of the exchange’s top executives</a>. In response, Binance <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-suspends-all-operations-in-nigeria/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">has shut down all Nigerian Naira (NGN) services</a> as well as delisted Naira trading pairs on its platform. However, there are still no indications the exchange will pull out of the African nation. </p>
<p>At the time of writing, the total crypto market cap is valued at $2.52 trillion, following a 4.23% decline in the last day. Meanwhile, Bitcoin, the market leader, now trades at $66,275.63 due to an ongoing price correction.</p>

<title>Shibarium Breaks The Internet (Again) With Over 400 Million Layer-2 Transactions</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。Shibarium是一个Layer-2区块链，取得了巨大的交易吞吐量里程碑，展示了其稳定性和潜力。与K9 Finance的战略合作将加强生态系统并促进创新，使KNINE代币在Shibarium平台上推出。虽然SHIB价格波动较大，但其在Forbes的加密货币投资排行榜上获得认可，显示其长期增长潜力。整体而言，SHIB在市场动荡中不断前行。 <div>
<p>Shibarium, the Layer-2 blockchain developed by the creative minds behind Shiba Inu (SHIB), has shattered expectations by reaching an extraordinary milestone in transaction throughput. Surpassing an impressive<a href="https://www.shibariumscan.io/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> 411 million transactions,</a>   Shibariumscan has revealed the platform&#8217;s resilience in the face of market volatility.</p>

<p>The recent surge in user adoption and the influx of dApp builders have contributed to Shibarium&#8217;s exponential growth. Over the past few days alone, more than 3 million transfers have been added, solidifying Shibarium&#8217;s position as a force to be reckoned with in the blockchain space.</p>
<p>This achievement is particularly impressive given the current daily transaction throughput of 1.03 million, which, although lower than its peak of 4.2 million transfers per day on February 20, reflects the platform&#8217;s stability and potential for further expansion.</p>
<p><img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-287675" height="222" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/a_e0e426.png?resize=1024%2C222" width="1024" /></p>

<h2><strong>Shibarium Forges Strategic Partnership, Expanding Its Ecosystem</strong></h2>
<p>In a move to fortify its ecosystem and foster innovation, Shibarium has recently formed a strategic partnership with K9 Finance, a prominent player in the financial technology industry.</p>
<p>This collaboration marks a significant milestone for both parties, as K9 Finance launches its native coin, KNINE, on the Shibarium platform. As a testament to their commitment, Shytoshi Kusama, the visionary leader behind SHIB, and Kaal Dhairya, the brilliant SHIB lead developer, have been appointed as official advisors to K9 Finance.</p>

<p></p>
<p>The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-partner-token-featured-on-us-tv-station/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">partnership between Shibarium and K9 Finance</a> showcases the platform&#8217;s dedication to fostering collaborations that drive growth and fuel its mission to revolutionize the blockchain landscape. This strategic alliance will undoubtedly open doors to new possibilities, leading to enhanced user experiences and the creation of innovative decentralized applications.</p>
<h2><strong>SHIB Navigates Challenging Waters Amidst Market Turbulence</strong></h2>
<p>While Shibarium celebrates its record-breaking achievements, the price of<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-active-addresses-soar-over-170/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> Shiba Inu</a> (SHIB), the second-largest meme cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has experienced a turbulent ride in recent days.</p>
<p>Exhibiting a correlation with the price movements of Bitcoin (BTC), SHIB has encountered a 28% decrease in value following Bitcoin&#8217;s correction from its all-time high of $73,750.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/KHvF4SWB/" width="1835" /></p>

<p>Investors may find these price fluctuations discouraging, but it is crucial to consider the broader context of SHIB&#8217;s ongoing development efforts. Notably, SHIB received recognition and was featured on Forbes&#8217; prestigious top 10 list of cryptocurrencies to invest in.</p>

<p>Additionally, the cryptocurrency garnered attention on the popular financial program &#8220;Eye on Your Money,&#8221; where it was mentioned alongside Bitcoin. While these accolades did not result in immediate price surges, they reinforce SHIB&#8217;s potential and the significance of its long-term growth prospects.</p>

<title>Crypto Analyst Sets $5 Target For Cardano Price – Here’s How</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-analyst-sets-5-target-for-cardano-price-how/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/crypto-analyst-sets-5-target-for-cardano-price-how/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的<br />ADA（ADA）在过去一周经历了两个阶段，价格最初触及数月高点，然后急剧下跌超过18％。尽管最近的价格跌幅反映了加密货币市场的普遍熊市氛围，但一位知名的加密分析师预测了Cardano价格未来几个月的上涨，预计ADA价格将增长670％。目前，ADA的价格为0.6626美元，虽然在过去24小时内下跌8.3％，但仍然是前十大加密货币之一，市值超过230亿美元。 <div>
<p class="p1">The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-king-of-dead-coins/">price action of Cardano</a> (ADA) over the past week is a story of two halves, with the token notching a new multi-month high early in the week only to crash by over 18% a few days afterward. This recent decline in ADA price reflects a broader bearish climate in the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p class="p1">Interestingly, a renowned crypto analyst on the X platform has put forward an exciting projection for the price of Cardano over the coming months. This latest price analysis suggests that this latest price downturn will be short-lived, with a bullish future on the horizon.</p>
<h2 class="p1">Analyst Predicts Cardano Price To Surge By 670%</h2>
<p class="p1">Popular crypto analyst <a href="https://x.com/ali_charts/status/1769096425407721629?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Ali Martinez took to X</a> to share his latest prognosis on the price of the Cardano token. According to the expert, the cryptocurrency’s current price action seems to be mirroring a pattern from 2018 to 2021.</p>
<p><img alt="Cardano" class="aligncenter wp-image-287623 size-large" height="660" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GI0X0dcXgAAw0Pf.jpeg?resize=955%2C660" width="955" /></p>

<p class="p1">From the highlighted weekly chart, the ADA price only recently broke out of a consolidation zone, which looks like a replica of the 2018 &#8211; 2020 consolidation range. Having retested the upper boundary of the range, the token looks set for a price upswing.</p>

<p class="p1">However, Martinez expects the Cardano price to move horizontally between $0.55 and $0.80 over the coming weeks. This period of sluggish activity will then be followed by a rapid price upswing to $1.70, according to the analyst.</p>
<p class="p1">In his post, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-doge-trading-volume/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Martinez</a> mentioned the possibility of a period of further price consolidation after the over 160% surge to $1.70. This is expected to “set the stage for a breakout to $5” for the Cardano price</p>
<p class="p1">This audacious projection represents an almost 700% surge for the ADA token from the current price point. From the highlighted chart, these bullish moves are expected to occur over the next few months in 2024.</p>
<h2 class="p1">ADA Price Overview</h2>
<p class="p1">As of this writing, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-network-sees-massive-growth-in-new-wallets/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Cardano token</a> is valued at $0.6626, reflecting a steep 8.3% decline in the past 24 hours. The altcoin, like the general market, has been experiencing a significant amount of bearish pressure over the past few days.</p>

<p class="p1">This dip comes barely three days after <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/analyst-predicts-cardano-price-to-skyrocket-by-1400/">ADA’s price</a> hit $0.8, its highest level in nearly two years. According to data from CoinGecko, the value of cryptocurrency has dropped by more than 18% since then, with a 12% decline in its weekly timeframe.</p>
<p class="p1">Nevertheless, the Cardano token still ranks as one of the ten largest cryptocurrencies in the sector, with a market capitalization of over $23 billion.</p>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：<br />这些信息是积极的。文章介绍了知名律师和XRP支持者约翰·迪顿对马萨诸塞州参议员伊丽莎白·沃伦的挑战性竞选，并向自己的竞选活动捐赠了50万美元。迪顿的竞选活动获得了加密社区的支持，包括卡尔达诺创始人查尔斯·霍金森等人。他对击败沃伦表示信心，指出了沃伦的弱点，并强调了他在加密社区的支持。此外，加密社区对迪顿在加密法规方面的影响提出了猜测，认为他的当选可能会对瑞波诉讼产生积极影响。迪顿致力于筹集100万美元的竞选资金，他的竞选策略强调了自由和对华盛顿的非党派领导力的需求。最后，文章提到了媒体对迪顿挑战沃伦的关注和认可。 <div>
<p>In a bold move, prominent lawyer and XRP proponent John Deaton has made a substantial $500,000 donation to his Senate campaign against incumbent US senator for Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren.</p>
<p>Deaton is presenting a Republican challenge to senator Warren, giving the prominent progressive her first serious, albeit still remote, opponent and setting up an election-season dispute over cryptocurrencies.</p>

<h2><strong>Deaton&#8217;s Campaign Gains Momentum With Crypto Community Support</strong></h2>
<p>Deaton&#8217;s announcement has ignited a surge of support from the crypto community, with many prominent figures expressing their endorsement and willingness to contribute to his campaign.</p>
<p>Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson was among the first to step forward, donating the maximum allowable amount of $3,300. <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/elizabeth-warren-rallies-donors-marine-veteran-crypto-attorney-john-deaton-announces-senate-challenge" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Deaton&#8217;s campaign</a> has also embraced crypto donations, allowing supporters to contribute using various cryptocurrencies.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I put in $500K of my own money because I know I can win. Please help me get to $1 million by March 31. Donate traditionally or through Crypto because freedom is on the line. <a href="https://t.co/qgDX3PTWJQ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://t.co/qgDX3PTWJQ</a></p>
<p>— John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1768759999533334680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">March 15, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<h2><strong>Deaton Confident In Victory, Cites Warren&#8217;s Vulnerabilities</strong></h2>
<p>Despite Warren&#8217;s long-standing presence in Massachusetts politics, Deaton exudes confidence in his ability to secure victory in the upcoming election.</p>
<p>He highlights several factors that indicate Warren&#8217;s vulnerability, including her low favorability ratings and the fact that a significant portion of eligible voters in Massachusetts are neither Democrats nor Republicans.</p>
<p>Deaton believes these factors, coupled with his strong support from the crypto community, give him a fighting chance to unseat the incumbent senator.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/uB97CnpQ/" width="1835" /></p>

<strong>XRP Community Speculates On Deaton&#8217;s Potential Impact On Crypto Regulation</strong>
<p>While Deaton&#8217;s campaign primarily focuses on challenging Warren&#8217;s anti-crypto stance, the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">XRP</a> community is abuzz with speculation about the potential implications of his victory for the ongoing Ripple lawsuit.</p>
<p>Deaton&#8217;s extensive legal experience and vocal support for the crypto industry have led many to believe that his election could positively influence the outcome of the case.</p>
<p>However, it remains uncertain whether Deaton&#8217;s involvement in the Senate race will directly impact the Ripple lawsuit.</p>

<strong>Deaton&#8217;s Fundraising Efforts And Campaign Strategy</strong>
<p>To bolster his campaign&#8217;s financial resources, Deaton has set an ambitious goal of raising $1 million by March 31st. He has turned to his substantial social media following, primarily crypto enthusiasts, to contribute to the cause.</p>
<p>Deaton&#8217;s campaign strategy emphasizes the importance of freedom and the need for nonpartisan leadership in Washington that represents the interests of ordinary citizens.</p>
<p>He believes that his outsider status and willingness to challenge the status quo resonate with voters disillusioned with traditional politics.</p>
<strong>Media Attention And Recognition Of Deaton&#8217;s Challenge</strong>
<p>Deaton&#8217;s candidacy has garnered significant media attention, with outlets such as Fox Business recognizing him as a major challenger who poses a genuine threat to Warren&#8217;s re-election bid.</p>
<p>His campaign has successfully captured the public&#8217;s imagination, and his message of freedom and crypto advocacy has struck a chord with many voters.</p>
<p>As the race heats up, it remains to be seen whether Deaton&#8217;s grassroots campaign can overcome the challenges posed by Warren&#8217;s incumbency and political establishment support.</p>

<title>Dogecoin Whale Dumps Substantial Holdings On The Market – Here’s How Much</title>

<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-whale-dumps-substantial-holdings-on-the-market-heres-how-much/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。一只鲸鱼最近出售了大量的狗狗币，导致狗狗币价格下跌。该鲸鱼将8600万DOGE存入加密交易所Robinhood，然后回购了部分DOGE。狗狗币价格因此下跌，导致其他加密货币如SHIB和PEPE也受到影响。然而，BOME显示出了增长势头。此外，一位加密货币交易者通过出售SHIB获利2300万美元，并从FLOKI和BIGTIME中获得4600万美元利润。这些信息表明现在是利润回吐的时期。 <div>
<p>A <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/elon-musk-tesla-dogecoin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Dogecoin (DOGE)</a> whale recently offloaded significant portions of their <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-whales-buy-up-doge/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">DOGE holdings</a> in an act of profit-taking. This action has negatively affected the meme coin’s price, which has been on a downward trend since then. </p>

<h2><b>Dogecoin Whale Offloads 86 Million DOGE</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://whale-alert.io/transaction/dogecoin/b4feb230f7cf8d9e73562e41f7b8f1ec2c55df578f496b0babb706ce5114f667" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">On-chain data</a> shows that the crypto trader deposited 86 million DOGE into the crypto exchange Robinhood in an effort to profit from the meme coin’s recent price surge. The whale, however, looks to be bullish on the meme coin in the long term, as they have since repurchased a significant amount of DOGE and still hold a substantial amount of it. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, due to the size of such a sale, the price of Dogecoin has since dipped and is currently on a downward trend. Before now, Dogecoin and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-meme-coins-myro-wif/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">other meme coins</a> had led other altcoins, making significant gains in these past few weeks. As such, it is understandable that the Dogecoin whale in question seized the opportunity to take some profits.</p>
<p>This week has been one of profit-taking from the meme coin ecosystem. Bitcoinist <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-pepe-whales-sold/#:~:text=Whales%20Cash%20Out%20Big%20Time%20From%20Shiba%20Inu%20And%20PEPE&amp;text=Since%20then%2C%20on%2Dchain%20data,realized%20gain%20of%20%2448.105%20million." rel="noopener " target="_blank">reported</a> on Shiba Inu (SHIB) and PEPE whales that earned a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-realized-cap-sets-all-time-high-price-next/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">realized gain</a> of $48.105 million and $3.364 million from offloading their meme coin holdings. </p>
<p>This wave of profit-taking has partly contributed to the significant drop in the prices of the foremost meme coins, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-shiba-inu-drop-15/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">DOGE and SHIB</a>, with both crypto tokens down over 6% and 18% in the last seven days. </p>
<p>However, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-meme-coins-myro-wif/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Solana-based meme coins</a> have upheld the broader meme coin ecosystem, with these crypto tokens pulling astonishing numbers for crypto investors. Book of Meme (BOME) stands out, seeing the growth that it has recorded since launching just this week. It rose to a $1 billion market cap and has been listed on major crypto exchanges. </p>

<h2><b>More Profit Taking From Meme Coin Traders</b></h2>
<p>On-chain analysis platform <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-pepe-whales-sold/#:~:text=Whales%20Cash%20Out%20Big%20Time%20From%20Shiba%20Inu%20And%20PEPE&amp;text=Since%20then%2C%20on%2Dchain%20data,realized%20gain%20of%20%2448.105%20million." rel="noopener " target="_blank">Spot On Chain</a> revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/spotonchain/status/1768821834412138522?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> a crypto trader who recently made millions of dollars from their <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-price-surge-0-000052/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">SHIB investment</a>. This trader had purchased 1.741 trillion SHIB (<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-price-0-0001-target/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">average price</a> of $0.000009272) for $16.146 million and sold all of them for $39.668 million (average price of $0.00002278), realizing a gain of $23.5 million. </p>

<p>This same trader is also said to have just realized $46.53 million in profits from FLOKI and BIGTIME. Meanwhile, Spot On Chain noted that smart traders, including MakerDAO founder Rune Christensen, have taken profits from SHIB in the past week, which has caused it to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-burn-rate-99-crash/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">dip significantly</a>.</p>

<title>Vanguard CEO Doubles Down On Anti-Bitcoin ETF Stance – Details</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/vanguard-ceo-double-down-on-anti-bitcoin-etf-stance/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/vanguard-ceo-double-down-on-anti-bitcoin-etf-stance/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是消极的。Vanguard首席执行官Tim Buckley再次强调投资巨头反对采用现货比特币ETF的立场。他指出比特币过于波动，不值得长期投资。Vanguard认为比特币是一种投机资产，不符合其投资模型。该公司偏爱投资于具有实际“基础现金流”的资产，比如股票或债券。尽管Vanguard保守的态度，一些其他资产管理公司已经接受了现货比特币ETF，认识到要提供多样化的投资选择。最近，一些资产管理公司已经采用了BTC ETF作为投资选择。Patient Capital请求SEC批准将其15％的资产转换为比特币ETF。比特币ETF的推出预计将推动机构对该加密货币的需求。现在，比特币正在69,260.35美元的交易，试图在过去两天的价格调整后实现市场反弹。 <div>
<p>Vanguard Chief Executive Officer Tim Buckley has once again reiterated the investment giant’s stance against the adoption of spot Bitcoin ETF. <a href="https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/news/vanguards-perspective-on-bitcoin-etfs#modal-transcript" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">In a video release</a> also featuring the company’s Chief Investment Officer Greg Davis, Buckley highlighted reasons backing Vanguard’s decision to be a non-partaker in the bubbling Bitcoin ETF market.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin Too Volatile, Not Worthy Of Long-Term Investment: Vanguard Boss</h2>
<p>According to Buckley, Vanguard has been receiving numerous inquiries on the potential of the company finally offering a spot Bitcoin ETF. This development is quite unsurprising following the company’s prominent anti-crypto stance, which draws much attention due to its status as the second-largest asset manager in the world. </p>
<p>Following the historic approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 10 by the US Securities and Exchange (SEC), Vanguard, alongside fellow investment firm Merrill Lynch were two major financial players to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/merrill-lynch-vanguard-says-no-to-spot-bitcoin-etfs/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">deny access to these novel investment funds</a> inviting much criticism from their customers and industry figures such as <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cathie-wood-vanguards-stance-terrible/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ark Invest’s CEO Cathie Wood. </a></p>
<p>Explaining Vanguard’s stance against offering Bitcoin ETFs, Buckley stated that the cryptocurrency operated as a speculative asset unsuitable for long-term investment and not in tandem with the company’s investment model. In buttressing this point, the Vanguard boss made reference to Bitcoin’s decline following a crash in the stock markets. </p>
<p>Buckley said: </p>
<blockquote><p>
Something like bitcoin is just too volatile and it&#8217;s not a store of value. It hasn&#8217;t been and it&#8217;s very volatile. When stocks got hammered in the recent crisis, bitcoin went right with them. And so it is speculative. Really tough to think about how it belongs in a long-term portfolio.</p></blockquote>
<p>
The Vanguard CEO also stated that they preferred to invest in assets with tangible “underlying cash flow” similar to stocks or bonds, a criteria they believe Bitcoin does not currently meet. In all, Buckley restated the investment company’s decision to abstain from spot Bitcoin ETF barring a change in the cryptocurrency’s asset class.
</p>

<h2>Bitcoin ETF Demand Surges On </h2>
<p>Amidst Vanguard’s conservative stance, some other asset managers have embraced spot Bitcoin ETFs, recognizing as they look to offer diverse investments catering to all their client’s unique needs. Most recently, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/4-bitcoin-etfs-get-nod-190-billion-wealth-manager/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">San Diego based financial firm Cetera</a> announced the adoption of four BTC ETFs as part of investment options.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Patient Capital, a $1.8 Billion asset manager<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/patient-capital-looks-to-invest-in-bitcoin-etfs/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">, has petitioned</a> the SEC for approval to convert up to 15% of its holdings to Bitcoin ETFs. These developments are highly exciting for the crypto community as the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs was expected to drive up institutional demand for the crypto’s largest asset. </p>
<p>So far, the spot Bitcoin ETFs have put on a stunning performance gaining a <a href="https://x.com/BitMEXResearch/status/1768556378858103064?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">total net flow of $11.95 billion</a> over the last two months of trading. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is currently trading at $69,260.35 as the crypto market leader attempts a market rebound following a price correction in the last two days.</p>

<div> <br /><br />摘要：这些信息是积极的。文章强调了比特币在加密货币市场中的韧性，并分析了市场的波动和解决方案。首先，文章描述了比特币价格的动荡，以及市场的震荡对其他加密货币的影响。其次，分析指导投资者在市场波动中采取长期视角的重要性。第三，文章探讨了比特币ETF和期权市场对比特币价格的影响。此外，文章强调了比特币作为数字黄金标准的价值。最后，预测了比特币未来的价格趋势，并强调了持有比特币和其他加密货币的长期潜力。 <div>
<p>Amidst the recent turbulence in the cryptocurrency markets, Bitcoin has once again proven its resilience, with industry experts advocating for a steadfast approach to weathering the storm.</p>

<h2><strong>Bitcoin&#8217;s Rocky Ride</strong></h2>
<p>Over the past 24 hours,<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> Bitcoin</a> has experienced a notable correction, shedding over 9% of its value, a significant downturn from its recent peak of $73,600. This correction has sent shockwaves throughout the broader crypto market, causing major altcoins to similarly plummet in value.</p>

<h2><strong>Navigating Market Volatility</strong></h2>
<p>In the face of this volatility, analysts like Kris Marszalek, CEO of Crypto.com, have stepped forward to provide guidance to investors.</p>
<p>Marszalek emphasizes the importance of adopting a long-term perspective when it comes to holding Bitcoin, advising against succumbing to panic amidst short-term fluctuations.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">&#8220;I think you would see a steady ramp-up, and that&#8217;s what we want. As the size of the market and the increasing liquidity happens, you will see lots of sudden moves,&#8221; said <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptocom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">@cryptocom</a> CEO <a href="https://twitter.com/kris?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">@kris</a> on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BTC?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">#BTC</a>. &#8220;This is an asset that you want to hold for decades, not for days or weeks.&#8221; <a href="https://t.co/GlMiDBEYKa" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pic.twitter.com/GlMiDBEYKa</a></p>
<p>— Squawk Box (@SquawkCNBC) <a href="https://twitter.com/SquawkCNBC/status/1768604975737835605?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">March 15, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<strong>Understanding The Forces At Play</strong>
<p>Examining the reasons behind<a href="https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cryptocurrency/24/03/37740013/bitcoin-bloodbath-digital-gold-loses-its-luster-but-are-investors-shaken-or-shopping" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> Bitcoin&#8217;s recent rollercoaster ride,</a> Marszalek sheds light on the role of Bitcoin ETFs in propelling the cryptocurrency to new heights. These inflows have presented a supply-side challenge, contributing to the recent surge in Bitcoin&#8217;s price.</p>
<p>However, he also points to the Options Market as a significant factor influencing the recent downturn, highlighting the complexities at play in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/wqR5hgtW/" width="1835" /></p>

<strong>The Enduring Value Of Bitcoin</strong>
<p>During a recent appearance on CNBC’s Squawk Box, Marszalek shared his insights on Bitcoin&#8217;s enduring value amidst market volatility. He emphasized that Bitcoin is not a short-term investment but rather an asset to be held for decades, likening it to a digital gold standard.</p>
<p>This steadfast belief in Bitcoin&#8217;s enduring value echoes sentiments shared by many within the cryptocurrency community.</p>
<strong>Looking Ahead</strong>
<p>As Bitcoin continues to navigate the choppy waters of market volatility, analysts anticipate a gradual uptrend in its price trajectory.</p>
<p>Marszalek predicts that as the market matures and liquidity increases, sudden and drastic price movements will become less frequent, providing a more stable investment environment for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>While the recent correction in Bitcoin&#8217;s price may have rattled some investors, industry experts like Marszalek advocate for maintaining a steady hand and focusing on the long-term potential of the cryptocurrency.</p>
<p>As Bitcoin continues to assert its position as a digital store of value, navigating market volatility with patience and foresight remains paramount for investors looking to capitalize on the opportunities presented by the burgeoning cryptocurrency market.</p>
