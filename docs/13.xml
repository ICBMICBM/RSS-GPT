<p>In a series of messages over the weekend, Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, addressed various concerns and rumors circulating about the project, specifically regarding the development of Hydra, partnerships, and the overall scaling strategy for the blockchain.</p>
<h2>Cardano Founder Debunks FUD</h2>
<p>Hoskinson <a href="https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">began</a> by addressing rumors that the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-founder-debunks-hydra-scaling-issues/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Hydra protocol</a> had been abandoned, labeling such claims as baseless fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD). &#8220;I&#8217;m seeing some videos claiming that Hydra has been abandoned. It is just pure FUD. The team has never been more productive and motivated, there is great community engagement and new papers on the way for enhancements to the protocol,&#8221; Hoskinson stated. He directed those curious about the project to the official Hydra website for the latest information.</p>
<p>When confronted with a barrage of questions regarding the timeline for various initiatives such as the DISH partnership, the ERC20 converter, activities in Ethiopia, other <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-strengthen-its-ecosystem-africa-partnership/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">African ventures</a>, and a partnership in Mongolia, Hoskinson provided a comprehensive update.</p>

<p>He highlighted the successful deployment of the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/game-on-cardano-erc-20-convertor-coming-soon-to-testnet/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">ERC20 converter</a>, which facilitated <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-backed-singularitynet-sets-in-switzerland/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">SingularityNET</a>&#8216;s transition to Cardano, making it a billion-dollar asset. Hoskinson further noted, “Our Africa work continues through John via the RealFi company, we successfully trained developers in Mongolia and concluded pilots with all the entities mentioned. Sorry, try again.”</p>
<p>Further addressing queries about scaling Cardano, Hoskinson encouraged viewers to watch a detailed video that outlines Cardano&#8217;s preparedness for scaling challenges in a decentralized, secure, and high-integrity manner. He underscored Cardano&#8217;s achievements, including over 2300 days of continuous operation, as evidence of the project&#8217;s resilience and commitment to its founding principles.</p>
<p>“Cardano is best positioned to meet these challenges in a decentralized, secure, and high integrity way. Never forget what we&#8217;ve accomplished together with over 2300+ days uptime 24/7 while maintaining our principles,” Hoskinson said.</p>
<h2>Clarifications On The World Mobile Partnership</h2>
<p>Regarding the skepticism and negativity directed towards Cardano, Hoskinson <a href="https://twitter.com/IOHK_Charles/status/1769452455257845806" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">speculated</a>, &#8220;Man, it&#8217;s raining FUD this weekend, and I&#8217;m not sure about the origin. I guess it&#8217;s that time of the cycle where everyone freaks out about Cardano&#8217;s potential and roadmap, so they throw a wave of FUD at us.&#8221;</p>

<p>He provided insights into the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-africa-special-iog-partners-with-world-mobile-to-connect-250k-people/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">partnership with World Mobile</a>, emphasizing the project&#8217;s ambitious goals. &#8220;No current system in the entire blockchain ecosystem is capable or has technology to resolve a project at this scale involving billions of users. That&#8217;s why World Mobile is building it,&#8221; Hoskinson explained.</p>
<p>Clarifying misconceptions about partnerchains, Hoskinson emphasized that they are indeed part of Cardano, contrary to some community misunderstandings. Partnerchains are designed to allow for the development of hypercomplex projects with unique protocols, such as different consensus mechanisms, ledger rules, and transaction semantics. He pointed out that this flexibility is crucial for projects like World Mobile and decentralized social networks, aiming to connect the unconnected through a decentralized network with equal and fair rules.</p>
<p>Hoskinson&#8217;s discourse over the weekend provided not only rebuttals to the circulating FUD but also reaffirmed the strategic direction and robust foundation upon which Cardano is building its future. His statements reinforce the commitment of the Cardano team to scale the network securely and sustainably while pushing the boundaries of blockchain technology&#8217;s potential.</p>
<p>At press time, ADA traded at $0.696.</p>

<div> <br><br>摘要：<br>这些信息是消极的。加密货币市场目睹了席卷性活动，Shiba Inu（SHIB）代币的1万亿转移引发了交易所的惊呼。此举引发了市场的震荡，并引起了交易者的注意。同时，Shiba Inu社区对即将推出的Shiba Eternity游戏充满期待。然而，市场波动使投资者感到不安，SHIB价格的大幅下跌导致了高额清算。尽管近期价格有所下跌，但SHIB在过去一个月展现出了强劲的表现，但大量SHIB代币转移到Gate.io给市场的稳定性投下一片阴影，使SHIB社区感到焦虑。 <div>
<p>Cryptocurrency markets witnessed seismic activity as Whale Alert, a leading service tracking large crypto transactions, reported a monumental transfer of Shiba Inu (SHIB) tokens. A staggering 1 trillion SHIB, equivalent to $28,814,000, was observed in transit from an undisclosed wallet to the portals of Gate.io, a major cryptocurrency exchange.</p>

<p>The colossal transfer sent shockwaves through the crypto community, prompting intense speculation about its implications. While the sender&#8217;s identity remains a mystery, such massive movements to exchanges often signal imminent sales or significant trading activity. This revelation injected a surge of volatility into the SHIB market, leaving traders on edge.</p>

<p></p>
<h2><strong>Game Development Excitement Amid Market Uncertainty</strong></h2>
<p>Amidst the tumult, excitement within the Shiba Inu community soared as updates on the highly anticipated Shiba Eternity game emerged. During a recent AMA session on Discord, Shytoshi Kusama, the visionary behind the Shiba Inu ecosystem, made a significant announcement.</p>
<p>Departing from his usual cryptic responses, Kusama revealed plans for beta testing of the play-to-earn (P2E) version of the game in the upcoming quarter.</p>

<h2><strong>Navigating Uncertainty Amid Liquidation Surge</strong></h2>
<p>As the SHIB market grappled with uncertainty, investors faced a tumultuous landscape of fluctuating prices and heightened liquidations. In the past 24 hours, SHIB experienced a <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/shiba-inu" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">significant downturn</a>, with prices plummeting by 14.27%.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/UuMIqmgN/" width="1835" /></p>

<p>Adding to market jitters, data from CoinGlass revealed a surge in liquidations totaling a staggering $5,280,000. Of this amount, $4,080,000 stemmed from long liquidations, while $1,200,000 resulted from short liquidations.</p>

<strong>Shiba Inu Shows Resilience</strong>
<p>Despite the recent dip, SHIB has demonstrated <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-active-addresses-soar-over-170/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">remarkable resilience</a> over the past month, boasting a staggering 194% increase following a substantial rally. However, the influx of SHIB tokens to Gate.io has cast a shadow of doubt over the market&#8217;s stability, leaving the SHIB community on edge.</p>

<title>Nigeria SEC To Hike VASP Registration Fees Under New Regime – Details</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/nigeria-sec-to-hike-vasp-registration-fees-under/</link>
<guid>https://bitcoinist.com/nigeria-sec-to-hike-vasp-registration-fees-under/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br><br>摘要：<br>这些信息是消极的。尼日利亚证券交易委员会提议提高虚拟资产服务提供者(VASP)寻求营业执照的注册费用。这一变化伴随着该国加密行业的关键方面的监管规定的其他变化。VASP注册费用将增加400%，加密交易所和交易平台需要支付更高的申请费和处理费，以及增加至10亿纳拉的最低实收资本要求。最近，尼日利亚与知名加密交易所币安的冲突成为大新闻，政府指控币安在尼日利亚奈拉贬值中发挥了重要作用，并要求赔偿。此外，该国政府对币安提出其他要求，币安回应称已停止在平台上列出奈拉交易对。目前，加密市场总市值为2.52万亿美元，比特币的价格下跌至66,275.63美元。 <div>
<p>Nigeria&#8217;s Securities and Exchange Commission has proposed to raise the registration fees for virtual asset service providers (VASP) seeking an operational license. This development is accompanied by other changes in the regulations governing the key aspects of the crypto industry in the West African country.</p>

<h2>VASP Registration Fees In Nigeria To Rise By 400%</h2>
<p>On March 15, the Nigerian SEC released a<a href="https://sec.gov.ng/proposed-major-amendment-to-the-rules-on-issuance-offering-platforms-and-custody-of-digital-assets-to-stakeholders-and-the-general-public/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> set of proposed amendments</a> to its Rules on Digital Assets Issuance, Offering Platforms, Exchange, and Custody. According to the securities regulator, the suggested changes are aimed at providing more regulatory clarity to a rapidly developing crypto market as well as implementing feedback from industry players following recent discussions with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). </p>
<p>Of all the updated regulations, a quintupling increase in VASP registration fees from 30 million ($18,841.75) to 150 million ($94,208.76) has been a major talking point as such policies are usually viewed as a means of discouraging business participation, in this case, the emergence of new crypto exchanges. Meanwhile, it could also function as a protective mechanism, thus ensuring that only sturdy and well-funded parties are able to operate as VASPs.</p>
<p>Furthermore, crypto exchanges and trading platforms would now be expected to pay an application fee and processing fee of 300,000 naira ($188.42) and 1,000,000 naira ($628.06) as opposed to previous values of 100,000 ($62.81) and 300,000 ($188.42) respectively. </p>
<p>In addition, the country&#8217;s regulator has also raised the minimum paid-up capital for these businesses to 1,000,000,000 naira ($628,058.40) which must be set in bank balances, fixed assets, or as an investment in certain securities. Meanwhile, there will be a fidelity bond covering up to 25% of this minimum paid-up capital in line with the Commission’s existing rules and regulations. </p>

<h2>The Nigerian Crypto Space And Its Troubles</h2>
<p>Lately, Nigeria has been among major crypto headlines due to an ongoing squabble with prominent crypto exchange Binance. The government of the West African nation has accused Binance of playing a significant role in the devaluation of Nigerian Naira, demanding compensation to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/nigeria-fines-binance-10-billion/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">the tune of $10 billion. </a></p>
<p>This accusation has been accompanied by the Nigerian government making other demands of Binance in terms of user data and reportedly<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/nigeria-detains-binances-crypto-crime-investigator/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> detaining two of the exchange’s top executives</a>. In response, Binance <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/binance-suspends-all-operations-in-nigeria/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">has shut down all Nigerian Naira (NGN) services</a> as well as delisted Naira trading pairs on its platform. However, there are still no indications the exchange will pull out of the African nation. </p>
<p>At the time of writing, the total crypto market cap is valued at $2.52 trillion, following a 4.23% decline in the last day. Meanwhile, Bitcoin, the market leader, now trades at $66,275.63 due to an ongoing price correction.</p>

<title>Shibarium Breaks The Internet (Again) With Over 400 Million Layer-2 Transactions</title>

<div> <br><br>摘要：<br>这些信息是积极的。Shibarium是由Shiba Inu发展的Layer-2区块链，在交易吞吐量方面取得了突破，显示了平台的稳定性和潜力。与K9 Finance的战略合作拓展了Shibarium生态系统，推动创新发展。尽管SHIB价格与比特币价格波动相关，但SHIB在近期发展中取得了认可，被列为Forbes十大加密货币之一，展示了其长期增长潜力。 <div>
<p>Shibarium, the Layer-2 blockchain developed by the creative minds behind Shiba Inu (SHIB), has shattered expectations by reaching an extraordinary milestone in transaction throughput. Surpassing an impressive<a href="https://www.shibariumscan.io/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank"> 411 million transactions,</a>   Shibariumscan has revealed the platform&#8217;s resilience in the face of market volatility.</p>

<p>The recent surge in user adoption and the influx of dApp builders have contributed to Shibarium&#8217;s exponential growth. Over the past few days alone, more than 3 million transfers have been added, solidifying Shibarium&#8217;s position as a force to be reckoned with in the blockchain space.</p>
<p>This achievement is particularly impressive given the current daily transaction throughput of 1.03 million, which, although lower than its peak of 4.2 million transfers per day on February 20, reflects the platform&#8217;s stability and potential for further expansion.</p>

<h2><strong>Shibarium Forges Strategic Partnership, Expanding Its Ecosystem</strong></h2>
<p>In a move to fortify its ecosystem and foster innovation, Shibarium has recently formed a strategic partnership with K9 Finance, a prominent player in the financial technology industry.</p>
<p>This collaboration marks a significant milestone for both parties, as K9 Finance launches its native coin, KNINE, on the Shibarium platform. As a testament to their commitment, Shytoshi Kusama, the visionary leader behind SHIB, and Kaal Dhairya, the brilliant SHIB lead developer, have been appointed as official advisors to K9 Finance.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-partner-token-featured-on-us-tv-station/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">partnership between Shibarium and K9 Finance</a> showcases the platform&#8217;s dedication to fostering collaborations that drive growth and fuel its mission to revolutionize the blockchain landscape. This strategic alliance will undoubtedly open doors to new possibilities, leading to enhanced user experiences and the creation of innovative decentralized applications.</p>
<h2><strong>SHIB Navigates Challenging Waters Amidst Market Turbulence</strong></h2>
<p>While Shibarium celebrates its record-breaking achievements, the price of<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-active-addresses-soar-over-170/" rel="noopener " target="_blank"> Shiba Inu</a> (SHIB), the second-largest meme cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has experienced a turbulent ride in recent days.</p>
<p>Exhibiting a correlation with the price movements of Bitcoin (BTC), SHIB has encountered a 28% decrease in value following Bitcoin&#8217;s correction from its all-time high of $73,750.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/KHvF4SWB/" width="1835" /></p>

<p>Investors may find these price fluctuations discouraging, but it is crucial to consider the broader context of SHIB&#8217;s ongoing development efforts. Notably, SHIB received recognition and was featured on Forbes&#8217; prestigious top 10 list of cryptocurrencies to invest in.</p>

<p>Additionally, the cryptocurrency garnered attention on the popular financial program &#8220;Eye on Your Money,&#8221; where it was mentioned alongside Bitcoin. While these accolades did not result in immediate price surges, they reinforce SHIB&#8217;s potential and the significance of its long-term growth prospects.</p>

<title>Crypto Analyst Sets $5 Target For Cardano Price – Here’s How</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br><br>摘要：这些信息是积极的。<br>ADA在过去一周经历了起伏，最初取得了几个月来的新高，但随后暴跌了18%。市场研究人员认为这次价格下跌只是暂时的，预测卡尔达诺的未来看涨。根据分析师的预测，ADA价格有望大幅上涨670%，从当前价格点开始。目前ADA价格为0.6626美元，市值超过230亿美元。虽然遭遇重大的跌势压力，但卡尔达诺仍然是前十大加密货币之一。 <div>
<p class="p1">The <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-king-of-dead-coins/">price action of Cardano</a> (ADA) over the past week is a story of two halves, with the token notching a new multi-month high early in the week only to crash by over 18% a few days afterward. This recent decline in ADA price reflects a broader bearish climate in the cryptocurrency market.</p>
<p class="p1">Interestingly, a renowned crypto analyst on the X platform has put forward an exciting projection for the price of Cardano over the coming months. This latest price analysis suggests that this latest price downturn will be short-lived, with a bullish future on the horizon.</p>
<h2 class="p1">Analyst Predicts Cardano Price To Surge By 670%</h2>
<p class="p1">Popular crypto analyst <a href="https://x.com/ali_charts/status/1769096425407721629?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Ali Martinez took to X</a> to share his latest prognosis on the price of the Cardano token. According to the expert, the cryptocurrency’s current price action seems to be mirroring a pattern from 2018 to 2021.</p>
<p><img alt="Cardano" class="aligncenter wp-image-287623 size-large" height="660" src="https://bitcoinist.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/GI0X0dcXgAAw0Pf.jpeg?resize=955%2C660" width="955" /></p>

<p class="p1">From the highlighted weekly chart, the ADA price only recently broke out of a consolidation zone, which looks like a replica of the 2018 &#8211; 2020 consolidation range. Having retested the upper boundary of the range, the token looks set for a price upswing.</p>

<p class="p1">However, Martinez expects the Cardano price to move horizontally between $0.55 and $0.80 over the coming weeks. This period of sluggish activity will then be followed by a rapid price upswing to $1.70, according to the analyst.</p>
<p class="p1">In his post, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-doge-trading-volume/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Martinez</a> mentioned the possibility of a period of further price consolidation after the over 160% surge to $1.70. This is expected to “set the stage for a breakout to $5” for the Cardano price</p>
<p class="p1">This audacious projection represents an almost 700% surge for the ADA token from the current price point. From the highlighted chart, these bullish moves are expected to occur over the next few months in 2024.</p>
<h2 class="p1">ADA Price Overview</h2>
<p class="p1">As of this writing, the <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cardano-network-sees-massive-growth-in-new-wallets/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Cardano token</a> is valued at $0.6626, reflecting a steep 8.3% decline in the past 24 hours. The altcoin, like the general market, has been experiencing a significant amount of bearish pressure over the past few days.</p>

<p class="p1">This dip comes barely three days after <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/analyst-predicts-cardano-price-to-skyrocket-by-1400/">ADA’s price</a> hit $0.8, its highest level in nearly two years. According to data from CoinGecko, the value of cryptocurrency has dropped by more than 18% since then, with a 12% decline in its weekly timeframe.</p>
<p class="p1">Nevertheless, the Cardano token still ranks as one of the ten largest cryptocurrencies in the sector, with a market capitalization of over $23 billion.</p>

<div> <br><br>摘要：<br>这些信息是积极的。文章介绍了知名律师和XRP倡导者约翰·迪顿在对麻省现任参议员伊丽莎白·沃伦发起挑战的竞选中进行了大胆举动，捐赠了50万美元。迪顿的竞选活动得到了加密货币社区的支持，包括卡尔达诺创始人查尔斯·霍金森等人的捐款。他对胜选信心满满，认为沃伦存在弱点，自己得到加密社区的支持有助于击败现任参议员。文章还讨论了迪顿在竞选中的筹款和策略，以及他的挑战获得的媒体关注和认可。文章最后探讨了迪顿可能对加密货币法规和瑞波诉讼的影响。 <div>
<p>In a bold move, prominent lawyer and XRP proponent John Deaton has made a substantial $500,000 donation to his Senate campaign against incumbent US senator for Massachusetts, Elizabeth Warren.</p>
<p>Deaton is presenting a Republican challenge to senator Warren, giving the prominent progressive her first serious, albeit still remote, opponent and setting up an election-season dispute over cryptocurrencies.</p>

<h2><strong>Deaton&#8217;s Campaign Gains Momentum With Crypto Community Support</strong></h2>
<p>Deaton&#8217;s announcement has ignited a surge of support from the crypto community, with many prominent figures expressing their endorsement and willingness to contribute to his campaign.</p>
<p>Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson was among the first to step forward, donating the maximum allowable amount of $3,300. <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/elizabeth-warren-rallies-donors-marine-veteran-crypto-attorney-john-deaton-announces-senate-challenge" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Deaton&#8217;s campaign</a> has also embraced crypto donations, allowing supporters to contribute using various cryptocurrencies.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I put in $500K of my own money because I know I can win. Please help me get to $1 million by March 31. Donate traditionally or through Crypto because freedom is on the line. <a href="https://t.co/qgDX3PTWJQ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://t.co/qgDX3PTWJQ</a></p>
<p>— John E Deaton (@JohnEDeaton1) <a href="https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1768759999533334680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">March 15, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<h2><strong>Deaton Confident In Victory, Cites Warren&#8217;s Vulnerabilities</strong></h2>
<p>Despite Warren&#8217;s long-standing presence in Massachusetts politics, Deaton exudes confidence in his ability to secure victory in the upcoming election.</p>
<p>He highlights several factors that indicate Warren&#8217;s vulnerability, including her low favorability ratings and the fact that a significant portion of eligible voters in Massachusetts are neither Democrats nor Republicans.</p>
<p>Deaton believes these factors, coupled with his strong support from the crypto community, give him a fighting chance to unseat the incumbent senator.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full" height="883" src="https://www.tradingview.com/x/uB97CnpQ/" width="1835" /></p>

<strong>XRP Community Speculates On Deaton&#8217;s Potential Impact On Crypto Regulation</strong>
<p>While Deaton&#8217;s campaign primarily focuses on challenging Warren&#8217;s anti-crypto stance, the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">XRP</a> community is abuzz with speculation about the potential implications of his victory for the ongoing Ripple lawsuit.</p>
<p>Deaton&#8217;s extensive legal experience and vocal support for the crypto industry have led many to believe that his election could positively influence the outcome of the case.</p>
<p>However, it remains uncertain whether Deaton&#8217;s involvement in the Senate race will directly impact the Ripple lawsuit.</p>

<strong>Deaton&#8217;s Fundraising Efforts And Campaign Strategy</strong>
<p>To bolster his campaign&#8217;s financial resources, Deaton has set an ambitious goal of raising $1 million by March 31st. He has turned to his substantial social media following, primarily crypto enthusiasts, to contribute to the cause.</p>
<p>Deaton&#8217;s campaign strategy emphasizes the importance of freedom and the need for nonpartisan leadership in Washington that represents the interests of ordinary citizens.</p>
<p>He believes that his outsider status and willingness to challenge the status quo resonate with voters disillusioned with traditional politics.</p>
<strong>Media Attention And Recognition Of Deaton&#8217;s Challenge</strong>
<p>Deaton&#8217;s candidacy has garnered significant media attention, with outlets such as Fox Business recognizing him as a major challenger who poses a genuine threat to Warren&#8217;s re-election bid.</p>
<p>His campaign has successfully captured the public&#8217;s imagination, and his message of freedom and crypto advocacy has struck a chord with many voters.</p>
<p>As the race heats up, it remains to be seen whether Deaton&#8217;s grassroots campaign can overcome the challenges posed by Warren&#8217;s incumbency and political establishment support.</p>

<title>Dogecoin Whale Dumps Substantial Holdings On The Market – Here’s How Much</title>

<div> <br><br>摘要：这些信息是消极的。文章报道了一只鲸鱼在抛售大量DOGE后，导致狗狗币价格下跌。此外，其他MEME币种也受到利润回吐的影响，包括SHIB和PEPE。尽管存在利润回吐现象，一些MEME币种如BOME仍然表现出色，并成功登陆主要加密货币交易所。最后，文章提到一位加密货币交易者从SHIB、FLOKI和BIGTIME中获利，并指出一些智能交易者已经开始从SHIB中获利，导致其价格下跌。 <div>
<p>A <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/elon-musk-tesla-dogecoin/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Dogecoin (DOGE)</a> whale recently offloaded significant portions of their <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-whales-buy-up-doge/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">DOGE holdings</a> in an act of profit-taking. This action has negatively affected the meme coin’s price, which has been on a downward trend since then. </p>

<h2><b>Dogecoin Whale Offloads 86 Million DOGE</b></h2>
<p><a href="https://whale-alert.io/transaction/dogecoin/b4feb230f7cf8d9e73562e41f7b8f1ec2c55df578f496b0babb706ce5114f667" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">On-chain data</a> shows that the crypto trader deposited 86 million DOGE into the crypto exchange Robinhood in an effort to profit from the meme coin’s recent price surge. The whale, however, looks to be bullish on the meme coin in the long term, as they have since repurchased a significant amount of DOGE and still hold a substantial amount of it. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, due to the size of such a sale, the price of Dogecoin has since dipped and is currently on a downward trend. Before now, Dogecoin and <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-meme-coins-myro-wif/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">other meme coins</a> had led other altcoins, making significant gains in these past few weeks. As such, it is understandable that the Dogecoin whale in question seized the opportunity to take some profits.</p>
<p>This week has been one of profit-taking from the meme coin ecosystem. Bitcoinist <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-pepe-whales-sold/#:~:text=Whales%20Cash%20Out%20Big%20Time%20From%20Shiba%20Inu%20And%20PEPE&amp;text=Since%20then%2C%20on%2Dchain%20data,realized%20gain%20of%20%2448.105%20million." rel="noopener " target="_blank">reported</a> on Shiba Inu (SHIB) and PEPE whales that earned a <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-realized-cap-sets-all-time-high-price-next/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">realized gain</a> of $48.105 million and $3.364 million from offloading their meme coin holdings. </p>
<p>This wave of profit-taking has partly contributed to the significant drop in the prices of the foremost meme coins, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/dogecoin-shiba-inu-drop-15/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">DOGE and SHIB</a>, with both crypto tokens down over 6% and 18% in the last seven days. </p>
<p>However, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/solana-meme-coins-myro-wif/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Solana-based meme coins</a> have upheld the broader meme coin ecosystem, with these crypto tokens pulling astonishing numbers for crypto investors. Book of Meme (BOME) stands out, seeing the growth that it has recorded since launching just this week. It rose to a $1 billion market cap and has been listed on major crypto exchanges. </p>

<h2><b>More Profit Taking From Meme Coin Traders</b></h2>
<p>On-chain analysis platform <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-pepe-whales-sold/#:~:text=Whales%20Cash%20Out%20Big%20Time%20From%20Shiba%20Inu%20And%20PEPE&amp;text=Since%20then%2C%20on%2Dchain%20data,realized%20gain%20of%20%2448.105%20million." rel="noopener " target="_blank">Spot On Chain</a> revealed in an X (formerly Twitter) <a href="https://x.com/spotonchain/status/1768821834412138522?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> a crypto trader who recently made millions of dollars from their <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-price-surge-0-000052/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">SHIB investment</a>. This trader had purchased 1.741 trillion SHIB (<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-price-0-0001-target/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">average price</a> of $0.000009272) for $16.146 million and sold all of them for $39.668 million (average price of $0.00002278), realizing a gain of $23.5 million. </p>

<p>This same trader is also said to have just realized $46.53 million in profits from FLOKI and BIGTIME. Meanwhile, Spot On Chain noted that smart traders, including MakerDAO founder Rune Christensen, have taken profits from SHIB in the past week, which has caused it to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/shiba-inu-burn-rate-99-crash/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">dip significantly</a>.</p>

<title>Vanguard CEO Doubles Down On Anti-Bitcoin ETF Stance – Details</title>
<link>https://bitcoinist.com/vanguard-ceo-double-down-on-anti-bitcoin-etf-stance/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br><br>摘要：这些信息是消极的。Vanguard首席执行官Tim Buckley再次重申了该投资巨头反对采纳现货比特币ETF的立场。他表示比特币太波动，不适合长期投资，并且不符合Vanguard的投资模式。尽管Vanguard保守的立场，一些其他资产管理公司已经采用了现货比特币ETF，以满足客户的投资需求。最近，一家公司宣布采纳四个BTC ETF作为投资选项。Patient Capital，一个18亿美元的资产管理公司，申请将多达15%的持仓转换为比特币ETF。现货比特币ETF迄今表现出色，在过去两个月的交易中上涨了一定百分比。此外，比特币当前交易价格为69,260.35美元，尝试市场反弹，紧随过去两天价格的调整。 <div>
<p>Vanguard Chief Executive Officer Tim Buckley has once again reiterated the investment giant’s stance against the adoption of spot Bitcoin ETF. <a href="https://investor.vanguard.com/investor-resources-education/news/vanguards-perspective-on-bitcoin-etfs#modal-transcript" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">In a video release</a> also featuring the company’s Chief Investment Officer Greg Davis, Buckley highlighted reasons backing Vanguard’s decision to be a non-partaker in the bubbling Bitcoin ETF market.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin Too Volatile, Not Worthy Of Long-Term Investment: Vanguard Boss</h2>
<p>According to Buckley, Vanguard has been receiving numerous inquiries on the potential of the company finally offering a spot Bitcoin ETF. This development is quite unsurprising following the company’s prominent anti-crypto stance, which draws much attention due to its status as the second-largest asset manager in the world. </p>
<p>Following the historic approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs on January 10 by the US Securities and Exchange (SEC), Vanguard, alongside fellow investment firm Merrill Lynch were two major financial players to <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/merrill-lynch-vanguard-says-no-to-spot-bitcoin-etfs/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">deny access to these novel investment funds</a> inviting much criticism from their customers and industry figures such as <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/cathie-wood-vanguards-stance-terrible/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">Ark Invest’s CEO Cathie Wood. </a></p>
<p>Explaining Vanguard’s stance against offering Bitcoin ETFs, Buckley stated that the cryptocurrency operated as a speculative asset unsuitable for long-term investment and not in tandem with the company’s investment model. In buttressing this point, the Vanguard boss made reference to Bitcoin’s decline following a crash in the stock markets. </p>
<p>Buckley said: </p>
<blockquote><p>
Something like bitcoin is just too volatile and it&#8217;s not a store of value. It hasn&#8217;t been and it&#8217;s very volatile. When stocks got hammered in the recent crisis, bitcoin went right with them. And so it is speculative. Really tough to think about how it belongs in a long-term portfolio.</p></blockquote>
<p>
The Vanguard CEO also stated that they preferred to invest in assets with tangible “underlying cash flow” similar to stocks or bonds, a criteria they believe Bitcoin does not currently meet. In all, Buckley restated the investment company’s decision to abstain from spot Bitcoin ETF barring a change in the cryptocurrency’s asset class.
</p>

<h2>Bitcoin ETF Demand Surges On </h2>
<p>Amidst Vanguard’s conservative stance, some other asset managers have embraced spot Bitcoin ETFs, recognizing as they look to offer diverse investments catering to all their client’s unique needs. Most recently, <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/4-bitcoin-etfs-get-nod-190-billion-wealth-manager/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">San Diego based financial firm Cetera</a> announced the adoption of four BTC ETFs as part of investment options.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Patient Capital, a $1.8 Billion asset manager<a href="https://bitcoinist.com/patient-capital-looks-to-invest-in-bitcoin-etfs/" rel="noopener " target="_blank">, has petitioned</a> the SEC for approval to convert up to 15% of its holdings to Bitcoin ETFs. These developments are highly exciting for the crypto community as the launch of spot Bitcoin ETFs was expected to drive up institutional demand for the crypto’s largest asset. </p>
<p>So far, the spot Bitcoin ETFs have put on a stunning performance gaining a <a href="https://x.com/BitMEXResearch/status/1768556378858103064?s=20" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">total net flow of $11.95 billion</a> over the last two months of trading. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is currently trading at $69,260.35 as the crypto market leader attempts a market rebound following a price correction in the last two days.</p>
