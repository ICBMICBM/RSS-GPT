<div> <br><br>摘要：<br>这些信息是积极的。本周美国创业公司融资排名前十的交易中，最大的交易是自动驾驶软件开发商Applied Intuition的2.5亿美元。此外，还有其他几家公司宣布了超过1亿美元的融资，涵盖了软件、生物技术、人工智能、工业网络安全、气候、饮料、机器人和食品等领域。此外，还介绍了全球最大的交易之一，德国的医药公司MorphoSys的B轮超过1.39亿美元。 <div>

Check out </span></i><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/biggest-us-vc-startup-funding-deals-2023/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Crunchbase Megadeals Board.</span></i></a></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a weekly feature that runs down the week’s top 10 announced funding rounds in the U.S. Check out last week’s biggest funding rounds </span></i><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/biggest-funding-rounds-ai-biotech-alumis/"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week was a story of the haves and have-nots. Of course there were more big AI-related rounds (the haves) but also a couple of big raises from some sectors that had been eschewed by investors not that long ago  — autonomous vehicles and industrial security (the have-nots). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All in all, it was another strong week for big rounds. The top 10 list also includes three new unicorns.</span></p>
<p><strong>1. </strong><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/applied-intuition"><b>Applied Intuition</b></a><b>, $250M, autonomous vehicles: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Autonomous vehicle software developer </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/applied-intuition"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Applied Intuition</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> locked up a </span><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/transportation/applied-intuition-valuation-autonomous-vehicle-startup-funding/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$250 million Series E</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> valuing the company at $6 billion — a 67% uptick in value from its previous round. The new round was led by </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/lux-capital"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Lux Capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/elad-gil"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Elad Gil</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and strategic investor </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/porsche-investments-management"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Porsche Investments Management</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Mountain View, California-based startup develops software for the automotive, trucking, construction, mining and other industries. The company leverages generative AI in developing software to help customers create driver-assistance systems and automated driving solutions. The up round comes despite venture funding in the autonomous vehicle sector continuing to be in decline. Last year, autonomous driving startups raised less than $5 billion — the sector’s lowest funding total since 2017, </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/lists/autonomous-vehicles-startup-funding/0ec813a0-0139-4e0f-83dd-d3188155b6b9/funding_rounds"><span style="font-weight: 400;">per Crunchbase data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The drop has come amid numerous setbacks for the industry. Just last month, </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/apple"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Apple</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> unceremoniously shuttered its autonomous electric car initiative after a decade of work. Founded in 2017, Applied Intuition has raised more than $600 million, per Crunchbase.</span></p>
<p><strong>2. </strong><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/luminary-cloud"><b>Luminary Cloud</b></a><b>, $115M, software: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Engineers make a lot of cool things nowadays. To do that, they need to simulate how things will react under certain conditions. Luminary Cloud, a computer-aided engineering SaaS platform, came out of stealth this week to help them do just that. The San Mateo, California-based startup also announced a $115 million raise led by </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sutter-hill-ventures"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sutter Hill Ventures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The company has customers in the aerospace and defense, automotive, industrial equipment and other industries, looking to solve challenges such as increasing the range of electric vehicles and achieving energy efficiency goals.</span></p>
<p><strong>3. </strong><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/zephyr-ai"><b>Zephyr AI</b></a><b>, $111M, biotech: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mclean, Virginia-based healthcare startup Zephyr AI closed a $111 million Series A from investors that included </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/revolution-growth-bac6"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Revolution Growth</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/eli-lilly-company-foundation"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eli Lilly &amp; Company</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Like many biotech startups raising big money currently, Zephyr is bringing AI to the sector. The company pairs its healthcare dataset with artificial intelligence algorithms to create insights in the areas of oncology and cardiometabolic disease. Founded in 2020, the company has raised nearly $130 million, per Crunchbase data.</span></p>
<p><strong>4. </strong><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/together-1a7e"><b>Together</b></a><b>, $106M, artificial intelligence: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was less than four months ago that AI startup Together </span><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/biggest-funding-rounds-databank-bluevoyant/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">made this list with a $102.5 million Series A</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> funding round led by </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/kleiner-perkins-caufield-byers"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kleiner Perkins</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Well, the Menlo Park, California-based startup is back with a $106</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> million round led by </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/salesforce-ventures"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Salesforce Ventures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/sections/crypto/feed/#footnote-1-89144" id="note-1-89144" rel="footnote">1</a>. The new round doubles the company’s valuation to $1.25 billion. The </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nvidia"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nvidia</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">-backed company has developed a cloud platform to allow developers to build on open and custom AI models — allowing customers to fine-tune open source foundation models. Founded in 2020, the company has raised nearly $230 million, per Crunchbase.</span></p>
<p><strong>5. </strong><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nozomi-networks"><b>Nozomi Networks</b></a><b>, $100M, cybersecurity:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Things are looking up for industrial cybersecurity startups. A week after </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/claroty"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Claroty</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> made this list, startup </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nozomi-networks"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nozomi Networks</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> locked up a </span><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/cybersecurity/nozomi-networks-funding-industrial-cybersecurity-ot-security/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$100 million Series E</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> from investors including </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/mitsubishi-electric"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mitsubishi Electric</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/schneider-electric"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Schneider Electric</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The San Francisco-based company offers industrial security — also called operational technology (OT) security — and IoT security platforms. While the sector is not threatening generative AI’s hold on investors, it does show once again investors — especially strategics — are eyeing the industry as attacks and threats mount. New OT security platforms have long been thought to hold potential, but securing older industrial control systems that were designed decades ago — long before cyberattacks were a reality — has proven difficult to build. Founded in 2013, Nozomi has raised $266 million, per Crunchbase.</span></p>
<p><strong>6. </strong><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/carboncapture"><b>CarbonCapture</b></a><b>, $80M, climate:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Los Angeles-based CarbonCapture, a direct air capture company, completed a $80 million Series A led by </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/prime-movers-lab"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prime Movers Lab</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Founded in 2019, the company has raised $115 million, per Crunchbase.</span></p>
<p><strong>7. </strong><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/liquid-death-mountain-water"><b>Liquid Death</b></a><b>, $67M, beverage: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Trendy beverage startup Liquid Death hit unicorn status after closing a $67 million financing at a $1.4 billion valuation. No lead investor was named, but the round included investment from the likes of </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/suro-capital"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SuRo Capital</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, strategics and several folks in the entertainment and sports world. The Los Angeles-based healthy beverage startup, founded in 2017, has raised nearly $268 million, per Crunchbase.</span></p>
<p><strong>8. </strong><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bear-robotics-inc"><b>Bear Robotics</b></a><b>, $60M, robotics: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Redwood City, California-based Bear Robotics, a robot waiter startup, raised a $60 million from </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/lg"><span style="font-weight: 400;">LG Electronics</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<h2><strong>Methodology</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We tracked the largest announced rounds in the Crunchbase database that were raised by U.S.-based companies for the seven-day period of March 9 to 15. Although most announced rounds are represented in the database, there could be a small time lag as some rounds are reported late in the week.</span></p>

<title>With Bitcoin Hitting New Highs, Will VCs Take Notice?</title>
<link>https://news.crunchbase.com/fintech-ecommerce/bitcoin-price-startup-vc-investment-halving/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br><br>摘要：<br>这些信息是积极的。文章提到了加密领域的风险投资近年来经历了波折，但比特币价格却在不断上涨。虽然风投资金已经有所回升，但对加密初创公司的投资仍然有所增长。一些主要的投资包括来自全球各地的公司。比特币价格上涨得益于美国证监会对数字货币交易所交易基金的认可以及即将来临的比特币减半事件。这些因素可能会激发更多投资者的兴趣，未来可能会推动风投投资的增长。 <div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s been a tough go for venture investors in the field of crypto in recent years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Funding took a tumble after highly-publicized events such as </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/sam-bankman-fried"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sam Bankman-Fried</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’s </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ftx-exchange"><span style="font-weight: 400;">FTX</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> debacle and the collapse of several other lenders. The </span><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/monthly-global-funding-recap-february-2024/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">overall general downturn in the venture market</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also did not help the still-maturing market.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In fact, venture funding to crypto-related startups fell to only $3.6 billion in 821 deals last year — a 78% drop from the $16.2 billion in 1,544 deals realized in 2022 — </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/lists/venture-funding-to-crypto-startups/7807cb9f-f714-4a34-9ddd-fa914f476630/funding_rounds"><span style="font-weight: 400;">per Crunchbase data</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, the much-maligned sector is now garnering headlines for a much different reason. Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market cap, is reaching new all-time highs as investors once again seem to be warming to the digital currency.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week, Bitcoin rose above the $72,000 mark — a dramatic rise considering it was less than $16,000 in late 2022. In the last 30 days, the cryptocurrency is up around 44%, or nearly $22,000. Bitcoin’s rise actually started in the second half of last year, with the digital asset up about 179% in the last six months.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the increase in price is too recent to really affect venture investment yet, funding to crypto-related startups has seen a bit of an uptick. So far in Q1, venture dollars already surpassed $625 million in 111 deals for crypto startups with nearly three weeks left in the quarter, Crunchbase data shows. Last quarter, such finding was only $446.3 million in 108 deals.</span></p>
<div class="infogram-embed"></div>
<p>&amp;&amp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some of the biggest rounds in the crypto sector included:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hong Kong-based super app </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/freechat"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Freechat</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> raised an $80 million Series A.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Paris-based crypto-financial service company </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/flowdesk"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Flowdesk</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> closed a $50 million Series B.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Zurich-based </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sygnum"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sygnum</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a regulated digital asset specialist, raised a venture round worth approximately $40.6 million.</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>What’s behind the price surge</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s unlikely the Bitcoin price surge has had much effect on venture funding in the sector so soon, but some of the forces pushing the price surge could indicate the sector is on the rise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps the biggest boost to Bitcoin was from an unlikely source: the </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/securities-and-exchange-commission"><span style="font-weight: 400;">SEC</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In January, the commission and its chairman, </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/gary-gensler-fb5f"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gary Gensler</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> — who has never been a fan of crypto — gave a lukewarm allowance to U.S. exchange-traded funds that hold Bitcoin from nearly a dozen asset managers, including behemoths such as </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/blackrock"><span style="font-weight: 400;">BlackRock</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/fidelity-investments"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Fidelity</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The acceptance has proven a game-changer for what had been a down sector. With the ETFs, investors can now trade digital currencies without actually holding it, and without having to trade it on crypto exchanges that usually have significant transaction fees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Investors have flocked to the ETFs with their ability to make crypto much more accessible. It is </span><a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/bitcoin-soars-record-high-uk-approval-crypto-asset/story?id=108004016"><span style="font-weight: 400;">estimated</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the top nine leading bitcoin ETFs received a combined $10 billion through their seven weeks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a similar move this week, the U.K.’s </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/financial-conduct-authority"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Financial Conduct Authority</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> also greenlighted exchanges in that country to trade crypto asset-backed exchange traded notes — likely sparking more interest in crypto from across the pond.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Bitcoin halving effect</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While those moves have likely excited investors who have been on the fence about crypto, Bitcoin also has been helped by an event expected next month.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bitcoin “halving” occurs roughly every four years, or for every 210,000 blocks validated. Miners get rewarded with Bitcoin for those validations, but the reward is cut in half when the “halving” occurs. That obviously means less Bitcoin will be entering circulation — therefore likely increasing demand by cutting the amount put into the system.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The event, which has occurred three times so far, brings headlines and excitement to the sector while also regulating the amount of Bitcoin — all things probably forcing the price of the asset upward.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Venture funding ramifications</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With what seems like sustainable tailwinds pushing Bitcoin prices up, what remains to be seen is what effect that may have on venture investing in the space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don’t think you’ll see a big uptick in investment this year, but 2025 could be bigger,” said </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/yash-patel"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yash Patel</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a general partner at </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/telstra-ventures"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Telstra Ventures</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> who invests in Web3 and fintech startups.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Patel said with Bitcoin price increasing due to ETFs and the halving event, there is more money being drawn into the sector. He added many in the crypto, blockchain and Web3 space have started and developed new technologies and projects even as investors pulled back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even during this past downturn, we never really saw a blockchain development dip,” Patel said. “Even as some projects were getting killed, developers continued to work in these spaces. Many learned to monetize in order to survive.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That could lead to some investors coming back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I would expect VCs to get back into investing in the space,” he said. “Crypto and blockchain are like cockroaches — they are never going away.”</span></p>

<div> <br><br>摘要：这些信息是消极的。2023年少有的独角兽公司加入，但退出仍然稀少，使独角兽公司数量超过1500家，总估值超过5万亿美元。AI领域增加了最多的独角兽公司，美国和中国是新独角兽公司数量最多的国家。尽管新独角兽公司数量减少，但私人独角兽公司数量达到了1500家，总筹资超过9000亿美元。2023年有10家独角兽公司通过IPO退出，而收购活动更加活跃。12月，8家新公司加入了独角兽行列，涵盖了不同领域。 <div>
<p>Fewer startups became unicorns in 2023, but <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/unicorn-company-list/">The Crunchbase Unicorn Board</a> also became more crowded, as exits became even scarcer.</p>
<p>That means that 10 years after the term “unicorn” was coined to denote those private startups valued at $1 billion or more, there are over 1,500 current unicorn companies globally, collectively valued at more than $5 trillion based on their most recent valuations from funding deals.</p>
<p>All told, fewer than 100 companies joined the Unicorn Board in 2023, the lowest count in more than five years, an analysis of <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/">Crunchbase</a> data shows.</p>
<p>Of the 95 companies that joined the board in 2023, AI was the <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/ai/new-ai-unicorns-2023-list-llm-platforms-cohere/">leading sector</a>, adding 20 new unicorns alone. Other leading unicorn sectors in 2023 included fintech (with 14 companies), cleantech and energy (12 each), and semiconductors (nine).</p>
<p>Based on an analysis of Crunchbase data, 41 companies joined the Unicorn Board from the U.S. and 24 from China in 2023. Other countries were in the single digits for new unicorns: Germany had four new companies, while India and the U.K. each had three.</p>
<div class="infogram-embed"></div>
<p>&amp;&amp;</p>
<h2>New records nonetheless</h2>
<p>Despite the slower pace of new unicorns, the Crunchbase board of current private unicorns has reached new milestones as fewer companies exited the board in 2023.</p>
<p>The total number of global unicorns on our board reached 1,500 at the start of 2024, which takes into account the exclusion of those that have exited via an M&amp;A or IPO transaction. Altogether, these private unicorn companies have raised north of $900 billion from investors.</p>
<p>This year also marks a decade since investor <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/aileen-lee">Aileen Lee</a> of <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cowboy-ventures">Cowboy Ventures</a> <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/sections/crypto/feed/#footnote-1-88940" id="note-1-88940" rel="footnote">1</a> coined the term unicorn for private companies valued at a billion dollars or more.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.cowboy.vc/news/welcome-back-to-the-unicorn-club-10-years-later">new report</a> looking at the unicorn landscape 10 years later, Lee said she believes the unicorn phenomenon is not going away, despite <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/global-funding-data-analysis-ai-eoy-2023/">a sharp downturn</a> in venture funding in recent years. She expects more than 1,000 new companies in the U.S. alone will join the ranks in the next decade.</p>
<h2>Unicorn exits</h2>
<p>In 2023, 10 unicorn companies exited the board via an IPO, far fewer than in recent years. That contrasts with 20 companies in 2022 and 113 in 2021.</p>
<p>However, M&amp;A was more active in 2023. Sixteen unicorn companies were acquired in 2023 — up from 2022 when 11 companies were acquired and slightly down from 2021 with 21 companies exiting via an acquisition.</p>
<h2>December numbers</h2>
<p>Eight new companies joined <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/unicorn-company-list/">The Crunchbase Unicorn Board</a> in December 2023. The highest monthly count last year for new unicorns was 10 and the lowest was two.</p>
<p>Of the new unicorns, three are artificial intelligence companies. Other sectors that minted unicorns in December include fintech, cybersecurity, food and beverage, and health care.</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>
<p><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/unicorn-company-list/">The Crunchbase Unicorn Board</a> is a curated list that includes private unicorn companies with post-money valuations of $1 billion or more and is based on Crunchbase data. New companies are <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/lists/crunchbase-private-unicorn-company-list/f406c855-fff9-419b-9b44-324e1bfe3081/organization.companies">added to the Unicorn Board</a> as they reach the $1 billion valuation mark as part of a funding round.</p>
<p>The unicorn board does not reflect internal company valuations — such as those set via a 409a process for employee stock options — as these differ from, and are more likely to be lower than, a priced funding round. We also do not adjust valuations based on investor writedowns, which change quarterly, as different investors will not value the same company consistently within the same quarter.</p>
<p>Funding to unicorn companies includes all private financings to companies that are tagged as unicorns, as well as those that have since graduated to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/lists/exited-unicorns/9436a996-90a9-40bc-91c0-a7d239de07f1/organization.companies">The Exited Unicorn Board</a>.</p>
<p>Exits analyzed here only include the first time a company exits.</p>
<p>Please note that all funding values are given in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. Crunchbase converts foreign currencies to U.S. dollars at the prevailing spot rate from the date funding rounds, acquisitions, IPOs and other financial events are reported. Even if those events were added to Crunchbase long after the event was announced, foreign currency transactions are converted at the historic spot price.</p>

<title>Rough Ride: M&amp;A Dropped 31% For VC-Backed Startups In 2023</title>
<link>https://news.crunchbase.com/ma/vc-backed-startup-acquisitions-ai-crypto/</link>
<guid>https://news.crunchbase.com/ma/vc-backed-startup-acquisitions-ai-crypto/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br><br>摘要：<br>这些信息是消极的。文章揭示了风险投资支持的初创企业去年的收购交易创下了八年来的最低水平，全球范围内的交易数量下降了，美国市场也出现了同样的趋势。文章提到了交易量下降的原因，即公司估值下跌、现金成本上升以及投资者持币观望。然而，预测2024年将会有所改善，因为公司希望投资并且一些热门领域可能会推动更多的活动。 <div>
<p>Dealmaking involving venture-backed startups hit an eight-year low last year, as strategic and private equity buyers decided to keep their cash, likely waiting to see how far startup valuations would drop.</p>
<p>It is not shocking that dealmaking hit a low ebb last year, but the dearth of VC-backed startups sold last year may offer a surprise. In 2023, only 1,738 venture-backed startups were acquired globally — the lowest amount since 2015, when 1,687 startups were bought — <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/lists/m-a-involving-vc-backed-startups-in-2023/81562cc5-51fd-4fd9-8737-e2e6bf30271f/acquisitions">per Crunchbase data.</a></p>
<p>The number is a 31% decline from the 2,507 deals in 2022 and a 21% drop from 2021.</p>
<p>The figures did not get better as last year wore on either. In fact, they declined quarter by quarter, with just 340 deals consummated in the fourth quarter.</p>
<div class="infogram-embed"></div>
<p>&amp;&amp;</p>
<p>The same held true in the U.S. as dealmaking involving VC-backed companies hit a 10-year low. In 2023, only 824 deals involving U.S.-based, VC-backed companies were completed, a 30% drop from 2022 and the fewest since only 710 deals were consummated in 2013.</p>
<p>Similar to the global trend, the U.S. market also basically saw a quarter-by-quarter decline through the past two years.</p>
<div class="infogram-embed"></div>
<p>&amp;&amp;</p>
<h2>Problems</h2>
<p>A lack of dealmaking can be devastating for venture capitalists. M&amp;A is the main way venture investors get liquidity back from their investments. Dealmaking was all the more important last year with the IPO market frozen — closing off the other option for investors to see cash.</p>
<p>Although the slowdown is alarming, it is hardly shocking. Cash has become more expensive while many startups have watched their valuations plummet from the highs of 2021 (<a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/ai/valuations-venture-not-slowing-2024/">except obviously those in AI</a>).</p>
<p>That has caused potential acquirers to hold onto their cash and play a wait-and-see game as they bide their time for the bottom of the market. Strategic acquirers have also been cautious to do stock deals to acquire firms, as some companies have felt their shares were undervalued in the market.</p>
<p>That’s not to say there were not any big deals. Per Crunchbase, three deals that involved venture-backed companies topped $3 billion globally last year.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/savvy-gaming-group">Savvy Games Group</a> acquired Culver City, California-based game publisher and developer <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/scopely">Scopely</a> for $4.9 billion in April;</li>
<li>Digital engineering firm <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/concentrix-corporation">Concentrix</a> merged with Paris-based <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/webhelp">Webhelp</a> in a deal announced in March and valued at $4.8 billion; and</li>
<li><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bhe-gt-s">BHE GT&amp;S</a> acquired <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cove-point-lng-limited">Cove Point LNG</a> for $3.3 billion in July.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Crystal ball</h2>
<p>However, those were definitely the outliers. Big deals — and really just any deals — were few and far between last year.</p>
<p>Now the question becomes: What will this new calendar year bring? Those with skin in the game seem to have varied opinions, but mostly expect dealmaking to perk up somewhat.</p>
<p>“I think in three to nine months you’ll see things picking up as valuations continue to drop,” said <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/umesh-padval">Umesh Padval</a>, a managing director at <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/thomvest-ventures">Thomvest Ventures</a> focused on investments in the cybersecurity, cloud and AI infrastructure sectors.</p>
<p>Padval added the <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/global-funding-data-analysis-ai-eoy-2023/">slow venture funding market</a> may leave some companies with no choice but to find a dance partner.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/navin-chaddha">Navin Chaddha</a>, managing director at Menlo Park, California-based <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/mayfield-fund">Mayfield Fund</a> <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/sections/crypto/feed/#footnote-1-88843" id="note-1-88843" rel="footnote">1</a>, said the hottest sector of 2023 likely will spur on some more activity this year.</p>
<p>“Public companies are sitting on hoards of cash,” said Chaddha, adding these companies are holding more cash now than they did during the 2008 downturn. “They want to invest, especially in AI.”</p>
<p>Others are also optimistic, looking at historical precedent.</p>
<p>“There’s never been three straight years where it’s been down, so …” said <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/daniel-nash-b92d">Dan Nash</a>, senior managing director and head of investment banking at <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cohen-company-capital-markets-a-division-of-j-v-b-financial-group-llc">Cohen &amp; Company Capital Markets</a>.</p>
<p>Nash said he could see sectors like cyber, crypto, semiconductors and, of course, AI all helping to make 2024 a little better than last year.</p>
<p>“Everyone is poking around right now,” said Nash, adding more deal activity could happen in the second quarter or half of the year.</p>

<title>Web3 Funding Cratered In 2023</title>
<link>https://news.crunchbase.com/web3/funding-cratered-sbf-ai-crypto-bitcoin-eoy-2023/</link>
<guid>https://news.crunchbase.com/web3/funding-cratered-sbf-ai-crypto-bitcoin-eoy-2023/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br><br>摘要：<br>这些信息是消极的。文章指出了2023年Web3领域的投资急剧下降，资金减少了74%，节后仅有11亿美元投资于Web3初创公司。文章分析了几个原因，包括市场环境的不确定性、投资者对行业的撤退以及比特币和监管的影响。虽然前景仍有希望，但2024年可能仍会面临挑战。 <div>
<p>Editor’s note: For more Web3 coverage, visit <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/web3-startups-investors/">Crunchbase’s Web3 Tracker</a>, where we track startups, investors and funding news in the Web3, cryptocurrency and blockchain space, powered by <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/">Crunchbase</a>’s live, comprehensive data.</p>
<p>It is not surprising to hear crypto, blockchain and Web3 protocols fell out of favor with investors last year — however, venture dollar numbers show exactly how unpopular the space became in 2023 among those who write checks.</p>
<p>Funding to Web3 startups — defined as those in the crypto and blockchain sectors — fell 74% year to year, with less than $7 billion going to startups in 1,564 deals, per Crunchbase <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/lists/funding-to-vc-backed-wweb-3-startups-by/7e3080df-2949-4694-940f-b127f0eda1b8/funding_rounds">data</a>. In 2022 those numbers stood at $26.6 billion in 2,891 deals.</p>
<div class="infogram-embed"></div>
<p>&amp;&amp;</p>
<p>The 2023 numbers represent the least amount of cash rolling into the industry since 2020 — when it was still nascent and saw only $5.7 billion in investment dollars — and is a far cry from the big-money days of 2021, when nearly $33 billion was invested.</p>
<h2>Fourth-quarter blues</h2>
<p>Web3 funding numbers have fallen pretty steadily quarter to quarter and Q4 of last year was no different.</p>
<p>The fourth quarter witnessed only $1.1 billion raised by Web3 startups in 221 deals — a 21% drop in dollars from the previous quarter and a whopping 65% from the final quarter in 2022 when investors spent $3.1 billion on the sector.</p>
<p>While it is easy to pick apart several areas of an ecosystem where funding dropped when declines are this significant, it is hard to move past the dearth of large growth rounds the sector saw last year in general and Q4 in particular.</p>
<p>Last quarter saw only crypto exchange <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/blockchain-info">Blockchain.com</a> raise a nine-figure round, locking up a $110 million raise in Series E led by <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/kingsway-capital">Kingsway Capital</a>. However, even that round came with a caveat — the company raised the round at a valuation less than half of the $14 billion number it received in March 2022 when raised a Series D led by <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/lightspeed-venture-partners">Lightspeed Venture Partners</a>, per <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-14/crypto-exchange-blockchain-com-raises-110-million-at-fraction-of-prior-value?sref=Dd2N48n2">Bloomberg</a>.</p>
<p>For all of 2023, Web3 startups saw only eight rounds of $100 million or more, the biggest being:</p>
<ul>
<li>Switzerland-based <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/islamic-coin">Islamic Coin</a>, a Shariah-compliant crypto asset, raised $200 million from <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/abo-digital">ABO Digital</a>.</li>
<li>Vancouver-based <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/blockstream">Blockstream</a>, which provides blockchain technology solutions for financial markets, raised <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/blockstream/company_financials">$125 million</a> in a convertible note and secured loan financing.</li>
<li>Vancouver-based messaging protocol <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/layerzero-labs">LayerZero Labs</a> closed a $120 million Series B funding round from 33 investors, including <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/a16z-crypto">a16z crypto</a> and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sequoia-capital">Sequoia Capital</a>, valuing the company at $3 billion.</li>
</ul>
<p>Comparatively, in 2022 Web3 startups saw 118 such rounds — including huge $450 million rounds for companies like <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/yuga-labs">Yuga Labs</a> and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/polygontechnology">Polygon</a> (we won&#8217;t even mention the $400 million round for <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ftx-exchange">FTX</a> and its U.S.-based exchange).</p>
<h2>What happened?</h2>
<p>Of course, the easy thing is to say this is <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/sam-bankman-fried">Sam Bankman-Fried</a>’s fault.</p>
<p>While not entirely untrue, Web3’s decline seems to link to more than just one man — who was found <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/fintech-ecommerce/sbf-ftx-guilty-verdict-crypto-investing/">guilty of seven criminal charges</a>, including two counts of fraud and five counts of conspiracy, in November for stealing about $8 billion from customers using his FTX cryptocurrency exchange.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/global-funding-data-analysis-ai-eoy-2023/">Funding is still down across the board</a>, and while Web3 was the buzziest sector in <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/business/global-vc-funding-unicorns-2021-monthly-recap/">the go-go days of 2021</a>, it also seems to have taken the greatest brunt of the pullback.</p>
<p>While seemingly every investor was once interested in the next crypto exchange, security feature for digital assets, or blockchain layer, now most have retreated in more difficult times to industries they know better, such as SaaS and enterprise software.</p>
<p>The one area that has not seen investors flee is <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/ai/hot-startups-2023-openai-anthropic-forecast-2024/">obviously AI</a>, and that too has hurt Web3. Investors left their shiny new toy in Web3 and fled to AI in droves. Instead of investing billions of dollars in infrastructure for decentralized applications, they are putting that money into AI-enhanced everything, from sales to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/emassagechair">massage chairs</a>.</p>
<p>But obviously the crypto problems played a huge role. FTX’s collapse along with problems faced by others such as crypto hedge fund <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/three-arrows-capital">Three Arrows Capital</a> and brokerage <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/genesis-2">Genesis</a> played havoc with the digital asset market, as other ancillary parts of the sector, like NFTs, fell on hard times.</p>
<h2>Hope for Web3?</h2>
<p>For founders and VC firms still interested in the sector however, not all hope is lost.</p>
<p>First off, bitcoin continues to see a significant rebound — jumping more than 100% from last March’s lows and now is well above $42,000. April’s halving event for the digital currency — when the rate at which new bitcoins are released into circulation is cut in half — always causes increased interest in bitcoin and that likely will be the case in the first half of the year.</p>
<p>Also, the added focus by regulators on the industry may help. Just earlier this year the <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/securities-and-exchange-commission">SEC</a> approved spot bitcoin ETFs from 11 firms — including well-established <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/blackrock">BlackRock</a> — in a long-awaited decision. The added scrutiny and regulation likely will add to its legitimacy in the eyes of many and increase adoption.</p>
<p>As for Web3 infrastructure players — startups looking to help build decentralized applications or help with ethereum scaling — times may remain tough as the ecosystem continues to be built out.</p>
<p>There is a chance AI could help with some of the automated processes needed in the buildout of a decentralized internet, which could attract investors. However, time will tell if even AI can help jump start investment in the sector.</p>
<p>Last year was brutal for what was once the reddest of red-hot spaces — 2024 may be better, but likely not by much.</p>

<title>Stablecoin Startup Circle Files Confidentially For IPO</title>
<link>https://news.crunchbase.com/public/crypto-stablecoin-startup-circle-ipo/</link>
<guid>https://news.crunchbase.com/public/crypto-stablecoin-startup-circle-ipo/</guid>
<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br><br>摘要：<br>这些信息是积极的。Circle公司计划进行美国首次公开募股(IPO)，尽管之前曾试图通过与特殊目的收购公司Concord合并来实现上市。该公司是USDC稳定币的发行者，计划出售股票数量尚未确定，预期在机构审查过程后进行。然而，之前与Concord的合并计划于2022年被取消，Circle仍坚持成为上市公司的战略，以增强信任和透明度。 <div>
<p><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/circle-2">Circle Internet Financial</a> has circled back around on its hopes to be a public company.</p>
<p>The company, which is behind the USDC stablecoin, said it has confidentially filed (although not all that confidentially since it issued a <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240111073632/en/Circle-Announces-Confidential-Submission-of-Draft-Registration-Statement-for-Proposed-Initial-Public-Offering">press release</a>) for a U.S. initial public offering.</p>
<p>Circle said the number of shares it plans to sell has not been determined and no proposed price range was given for the offering. The offering is expected to take place after the <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/securities-and-exchange-commission">SEC</a> completes its review process.</p>
<p>The Boston-based firm is the issuer of USDC, which is pegged to the U.S. dollar and is the second biggest stablecoin behind only Tether. There are more $25 billion worth of USDC in circulation.</p>
<h2>Try again</h2>
<p>This is not Circle’s first attempt to hit the public market.</p>
<p>Circle’s proposed merger with blank-check firm Concord, which is backed by former <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/barclays-7c03">Barclays</a> boss <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/bob-diamond-39ba">Bob Diamond</a>, has been its own long and winding story.</p>
<p>The company — an issuer of USD Coin, a type of stablecoin — announced</p>
<p>In July 2021, Circle said it would merge with <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/bob-diamond-39ba">Bob Diamond</a>’s special-purpose acquisition company Concord Acquisition Corp. in a deal that would value the company at $4.5 billion.</p>
<p>However, USD Coin’s circulation quickly doubled, and in early 2022 Circle <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/fintech-ecommerce/circle-coinbase-robinhood-crypto-spac/">terminated its previously announced merger agreement</a> and agreed to new terms that doubled the crypto company’s valuation to $9 billion.</p>
<p>That deal was expected to close in December 2022 or be extended but was instead called off.</p>
<p>“We are disappointed the proposed transaction timed out, however, becoming a public company remains part of Circle’s core strategy to enhance trust and transparency, which has never been more important,” said <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/jeremy-allaire-f13f">Jeremy Allaire</a>, co-founder and CEO of Circle, in a <a href="https://www.circle.com/en/pressroom/circle-and-concord-acquisition-corp-mutually-agree-to-terminate-proposed-business-combination">release</a> at the time.</p>

<title>From SVB And SBF To AI And IPOs, There Was A Lot Of Action (And Acronyms) In 2023</title>
<link>https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/svb-sbf-ai-ipos-timeline-eoy-2023/</link>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br><br>摘要：<br>这些信息是消极的。2023年被认为是一次艰难的一年，受到了众多影响如加密货币领域的崩溃、银行危机、人工智能风潮、创业公司裁员以及经济放缓的影响。加密货币交易所的创始人因涉嫌在其交易所上盗取了约80亿美元而被定罪，AI领域获得了巨额投资，同时康沃利、Silicon Valley Bank等公司的倒闭导致了大规模的失业和金融危机。此外，OpenAI公司的CEO由于沟通不畅被解雇，但最终重返公司。2023年的故事充满波折，预计将继续在未来展开。 <div>
<p><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/global-vc-funding-slide-q4-2022/">After a rough 2022</a>, many people in venture were hoping 2023 would offer a reprieve.</p>
<p>While the year did see some steadying in the venture-backed startup world, it did not lack for big stories, big busts and big buzz.</p>
<p>From crypto contagion to a banking crisis that rocked the industry, to a CEO’s firing saga that was like a never-ending soap opera storyline, 2023 saw a lot — so let’s take a look back as we go forward.</p>
<h2>Crypto contagion</h2>
<p>The year started with many folks still trying to wrap their heads around one of the greatest startup implosions of all time: That of crypto exchange <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ftx-exchange">FTX</a>. Company founder <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/sam-bankman-fried">Sam Bankman-Fried</a> was already <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/fintech-ecommerce/bankman-fried-indicted-sued/">facing criminal charges — including fraud</a> — in the collapse of the highly valued company.</p>
<p>FTX and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ftx-us">FTX US</a>, its U.S.-based exchange, were valued at $32 billion and $8 billion, respectively, and were backed by some of of the biggest names in venture — including <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/sequoia-capital">Sequoia Capital</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/new-enterprise-associates">NEA</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/lightspeed-venture-partners">Lightspeed Venture Partners</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/insight-partners">Insight Partners</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/temasek">Temasek</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/softbank-vision-fund">SoftBank Vision Fund</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/thoma-bravo">Thoma Bravo</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/softbank-vision-fund">SoftBank Vision Fund 2</a> and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/coinbase-ventures">Coinbase Ventures</a>.</p>
<p>Despite the crypto contagion that gripped the industry — with several startups declaring bankruptcy and/or announcing layoffs — crypto prices steadily rose through the year.</p>
<p>However, VC optimism was not as high and crypto and Web3 funding declined significantly.</p>
<p>Finally in November, a jury <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/fintech-ecommerce/sbf-ftx-guilty-verdict-crypto-investing/">convicted</a> Sam Bankman-Fried, commonly known by his initials SBF, on all seven criminal charges he faced, including two counts of fraud and five counts of conspiracy. The jury in Manhattan took just over four hours to decide the disgraced founder stole about $8 billion from customers on his cryptocurrency exchange. In total, the seven charges could bring a 115-year prison term, although legal experts have said Bankman-Fried, who has a sentencing hearing slated for March 2024, is unlikely to receive a sentence that long.</p>
<h2>AI = big money</h2>
<p>The seeds of this year’s AI craze were firmly planted in late 2022, when London-based AI-driven visual art startup <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/stability-ai">Stability AI</a>, San Francisco-based AI video and audio editing tool <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/descript">Descript</a>, and Austin, Texas-based AI content platform <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/jasper-da51">Jasper</a> all raised big rounds.</p>
<p>However, the even bigger news came in the first month of the new year, as <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft">Microsoft</a> invested a reported $10 billion into AI goliath <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/openai">OpenAI</a>, the company behind the artificial intelligence tools <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a> and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/dall-e-2">DALL-E</a>.</p>
<p>That, of course, was just the beginning. Dozens of AI startups in the sector — or at the very least claiming to be using AI — raised billions of dollars. Some of the biggest deals include:</p>
<ul>
<li>In June, Palo Alto, California-based <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/inflection-ai">Inflection AI</a> locked up a huge <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/ai-robotics/funding-explosion-venture-generative-ai-unicorn/">$1.3 billion round</a> led by <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/reid-hoffman">Reid Hoffman</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/bill-gates">Bill Gates</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/eric-schmidt">Eric Schmidt</a> and new investor <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nvidia">Nvidia</a>, which valued Inflection AI at $4 billion, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2023/06/28/inflection-ai-raises-1-billion-for-chatbot-pi/?sh=4799a88a2bd4">according to Forbes</a>. The startup is building what it says will be the “largest AI cluster in the world” and has created large language models to allow people to interact with its AI-powered assistant called Pi, or Personal AI.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In September,  </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">San Francisco-based Anthropic inked a deal with </span><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/amazon"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Amazon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> for the e-commerce and cloud titan to invest up to </span><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/ai-robotics/amzn-investment-startup-anthropic/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">$4 billion</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the AI startup. The new investment gives Seattle-based Amazon a minority stake in Anthropic. The immediate investment is $1.25 billion, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">with either party having the right to trigger another $2.75 billion in funding, </span><a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/amazon-steps-up-ai-race-with-up-4-billion-deal-invest-anthropic-2023-09-25/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reuters reported</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></li>
<li>In November, Germany-based <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/aleph-alpha">Aleph Alpha</a> raised a <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/ai/openai-anthropic-competitor-germany-aleph-alpha/">$500 million Series B</a> as AI startups outside the U.S. continued to see bigger rounds as the year wore on. The round was led by <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/innovation-park-artificial-intelligence">Innovation Park Artificial Intelligence</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/robert-bosch-venture-capital">Bosch Ventures</a> and the companies of <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/schwarz-group">Schwarz Group</a>. Founded in 2019, Aleph Alpha allows companies to develop and deploy large language and multimodal models.</li>
</ul>
<p>The AI craze among investors <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/ai-robotics/ai-venture-funding-nvidia-microsoft-salesforce-intel-google/">included large corporations and their VC arms</a>. Aside from Microsoft, others, including <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/google">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/zoom-venture">Zoom Ventures</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nvidia">Nvidia</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/oracle">Oracle</a> and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/salesforce-ventures">Salesforce Ventures</a><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/sections/crypto/feed/#footnote-1-88645" id="note-1-88645" rel="footnote">1</a> all found it hard to say no to big rounds in the AI space.</p>
<p>While money poured into AI, so did drama, but that’s for a little later.</p>
<h2>Yet another crisis</h2>
<p>Not even AI could stop what would come next, as the industry would suffer a most unexpected blow.</p>
<p>On March 9, the iconic startup bank <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/silicon-valley-bank">Silicon Valley Bank</a> — which had relationships with more than half of all venture-backed companies in the U.S. and countless VC firms — <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/silicon-valley-bank-stock-startup/">saw its stock price plunge after announcing it would sell $2.25 billion worth of stock to shore up its balance sheet</a>.</p>
<p>Even as the bank sought to assure customers all was well, the announcement rocked the venture world and led to concerns about the bank’s liquidity and balance sheet strength.</p>
<p>Customers — including many startups — sought to get their deposits out of the failing bank, with many needing the money to make upcoming payrolls. The bank’s collapse forced <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/parker-conrad">Parker Conrad</a>’s workforce management startup <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/rippling">Rippling</a> to raise $500 million in hours so its clients could pay employees as concerns about access to SVB-held funds swirled.</p>
<p>That soon led to a run on withdrawals and an end of what had become the dominant bank for VC-backed startups for the past 40 years, providing banking services for “up-and-coming” tech companies such as <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/cisco-systems-danmark">Cisco Systems</a> and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bay-networks">Bay Networks</a> back in the day.</p>
<p>SVB’s collapse was in part due to the decline venture had witnessed through the past year-plus. During <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/business/global-vc-funding-unicorns-2021-monthly-recap/">the 2021 venture capital boom</a>, the bank was flush with cash as private companies raised huge sums of fresh capital at sky-high valuations. But <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/global-vc-funding-slide-q4-2022/">the market slowed</a> with rising interest rates, and that cash dried up as deposits by startups dipped. SVB simultaneously made the disastrous decision to invest in long-term, higher-yield bonds, which further hindered its liquidity.</p>
<p>On March 26, the <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/federal-deposit-insurance-corporation">Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.</a> <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/business/svb-sale-first-citizens-report/">announced</a> <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/first-citizens-bank">First Citizens BancShares</a> had agreed to buy the loans and deposits of the failed Silicon Valley Bank.</p>
<p>Just like that, a vital pillar in the venture capital ecosystem — known for its vast venture lending practice for startups — was gone after four decades.</p>
<p>A report by the <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/federal-reserve-board-4667">Federal Reserve Board</a> said the collapse was a “<a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/svb-collapse-mismanagement-fed-report-startups/">textbook case of mismanagement by the bank”</a> and that when the bank’s board and management realized its risks, it did not take the appropriate steps to fix those problems quickly.</p>
<p>Days after regulators issued a report on the historic collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/first-republic-bank">First Republic Bank</a> — with its expanding technology division and serving as the bank of a growing number of startups — <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/business/regulators-takeover-first-republic-bank-jpmorgan-chase/">also fell into receivership and was quickly sold</a> to <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/jpmorgan-chase-co-a20b">JPMorgan Chase</a>.</p>
<p>The two banks’ collapses — the second- (First Republic) and third- (SVB) largest in U.S. history — have changed, and likely will continue to change, the way startups bank, with many now looking to diversify where they put assets and how they are held.</p>
<p>The failures also will continue to affect <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/low-debt-numbers-startups-svb/">how companies can secure venture debt</a> — something more needed now in a slow venture market.</p>
<h2>Tech layoffs mounted</h2>
<p>The venture slowdown didn’t just affect banks. As cash became tighter in tech, companies both big and small continued to lay people off.</p>
<p>Since the start of the year, around 190,000 workers at U.S.-based tech companies — or tech companies with a large U.S. workforce — have been laid off in mass job cuts, <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/startups/tech-layoffs/">according to  Crunchbase News’ Tech Layoffs Tracker</a>.</p>
<p>Those layoffs have happened everywhere, from big-name public companies including <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/alphabet">Alphabet</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/oracle">Oracle</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/splunk">Splunk</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/qualcomm">Qualcomm</a> and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/coinbase">Coinbase</a>, to startups such as <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/navan">Navan</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/pendo-io">Pendo</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/reddit">Reddit</a> and hundreds of smaller companies.</p>
<p>Those job cuts probably shouldn’t come as a surprise. VC and growth-equity giants including <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/andreessen-horowitz">Andreessen Horowitz</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/softbank">SoftBank</a> and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/tiger-global">Tiger Global</a> have all substantially slowed their investment pace since the highs of 2021.</p>
<p>Along with companies shedding jobs, we&#8217;ve also seen some high-profile startups completely shutter in recent months, including <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/convoy-3">Convoy</a> and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/D2iQ">D2iQ</a>.</p>
<p>Job cuts and total shutdowns could continue into the new year. Many companies have been able to live off the vast sums they raised in 2021 and 2022, but that money is likely dwindling. In addition, factors such as companies continuing to shift their focus back to profitability and away from growth, and the emergence of AI could mean more layoffs in 2024.</p>
<h2>IPO market rebound?</h2>
<p>That doesn’t mean there were not some positive economic signs in the market.</p>
<p>In August, after nearly two years, the tech IPO market finally opened back up.</p>
<p>Leading the way were two highly expected and heavily funded startups, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/arm">Arm Holdings</a> and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/instacart">Instacart</a>.</p>
<p>The hope then, as it is now, for investors is that those IPOs — along with marketing email automation company <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/klaviyo">Klaviyo</a>’s — could help thaw out the frozen IPO pipeline. It was just two years ago when <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/public/heres-whos-gone-public-in-2021-so-far/">more than 350 venture-backed companies went public in the U.S.</a></p>
<p>Exit opportunities are vital to a healthy and robust venture market. VCs need the liquidity from IPOs or M&amp;A events to show LPs returns — so they have money to invest in funds again and possibly at higher rates.</p>
<p>It’s still unclear if the flurry of activity will lead to increased IPO activity in 2024, but hopes are high that companies like <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/stripe">Stripe</a> will see the thawing of the stagnant market as an opportunity to finally give more employees a chance to make their fortune.</p>
<h2>Altman drama</h2>
<p>Of course, the year could not end without more drama, and this time it was AI darling OpenAI that would provide it.</p>
<p>On Nov. 17, news broke its co-founder and AI wunderkind <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/sam-altman">Sam Altman</a> was out as the company’s CEO. <a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-announces-leadership-transition">In a posting</a>, the company said Altman’s departure comes after “a deliberative review process by the board, which concluded that he was not consistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities. The board no longer has confidence in his ability to continue leading OpenAI.”</p>
<p>The news rocked the tech and venture world and became the only story for days as the saga dragged on.</p>
<p>Over the next few days, news around the shocking removal continued as nearly every <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/openai">OpenAI</a> employees had signed a letter to the company’s board saying they would leave the generative AI startup unless the board resigned and brought back Altman and former President <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/greg-brockman">Greg Brockman</a>.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Altman and Brockman agreed to join a new AI research venture at tech giant <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/microsoft">Microsoft</a> — OpenAI’s biggest backer.</p>
<p>Finally, the soap opera ended five days later as Altman returned as CEO and the company agreed to revamp its board.</p>
<p>Oddly, very little has come out as to why Altman was fired. Microsoft CEO <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/satya-nadella">Satya Nadella</a> has said in media interviews that there is no substantial smoking gun behind the firing.</p>
<p>“The board has not talked about anything that Sam did other than some breakdown in communications,” Nadella said in an <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2023-11-20/microsoft-wants-to-work-with-altman-no-matter-what-video">interview with Bloomberg News</a>.</p>
<p>Expect more on that to come out in the new year, as well as more of the fun, frivolity, drama and disappointment the venture world is known for.</p>

<div> <br><br>摘要：<br>这些信息是消极的。2020年和2021年初，虎扑是增长轮次领域的领导者。然而，2022年，该公司的交易数量和投资总额骤减，对投资市场的影响明显减弱。2023年，虎扑参与的交易数量进一步下降。其中，今年最大的一笔交易是一笔约6100万美元的B轮融资。有报道显示，虎扑在最近一年的风险资金中损失了大约33%的价值。虎扑曾经对一些公司进行过大幅度的减值，这可能导致公司在此市场上变得谨慎。 <div>
<p><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/tiger-global">Tiger Global</a>, quite possibly the poster child for the go-go venture days of 2020 and 2021, is on pace to slash its deal flow more than 90% from 2022, as the one-time growth-round leader significantly pulled back in the venture market.</p>
<p>Last year, Tiger took part in 288 deals, with those deals totaling a mind-blowing $23.2 billion, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/lists/tiger-investments/159f71d7-14fa-4087-8dba-ce40b964db18/funding_rounds">per Crunchbase data</a>. (It is important to note that the total amount of deals is not Tiger’s stake but the total amount invested by all investors. Individual stakes by VC firms in a single round usually are not announced.)</p>
<p>With only weeks remaining in 2023, the firm has taken part in only 27 deals, totaling less than $2 billion. In fact, Tiger has only one announced deal thus far in Q4 for an undisclosed amount.</p>
<div class="infogram-embed"></div>
<p>&amp;&amp;</p>
<p>While the biggest round Tiger participated in this year was <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/databricks">Databricks</a>’ massive <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/ai-robotics/databricks-funding-valuation-nvda/">$500 million-plus Series I</a> led by funds and accounts advised by <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/t-rowe-price">T. Rowe Price Associates</a>, the biggest round it led was a much smaller Series B worth approximately $61 million for Brazil-based fintech startup <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nomad-deb4">Nomad</a>.</p>
<p>Last year, Tiger co-led a $768 million Series E for London-based on-demand delivery startup <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/getir">Getir</a>.</p>
<h2>Different time</h2>
<p>However, 2022 was a very different time for Tiger, especially early in the year when it took part in more than 240 deals.</p>
<p>The second half of last year saw the <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/global-vc-funding-slide-q4-2022/">venture market recoil</a>, as interest rates rose, inflation crept in and the public markets became wobbly.</p>
<p>The result was a significant venture capital pullback — especially in late-stage growth rounds, where Tiger participated — valuation drops and massive recalibration through the tech startup ecosystem.</p>
<p>This year Tiger has seen some of the effects of those changes.</p>
<p>In February, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/wall-street-journal">The Wall Street Journal</a> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiger-global-cuts-fundraising-target-as-startup-market-cools-11675290222">reported</a> Tiger had yet again reduced the target size for its latest venture fund to $5 billion — down from a $6 billion target it set last fall and down even more from the $8 billion the firm had anticipated raising earlier.</p>
<p>Just last month Tiger Global told investors that venture head <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/scott-shleifer">Scott Shleifer</a> was stepping down from his role and transitioning to a senior adviser position.</p>
<p>After that announcement, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-30/tiger-global-s-biggest-venture-fund-has-18-loss-after-markdowns?sref=Dd2N48n2">Bloomberg reported</a> investors in Tiger’s <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/fund/tiger-global-raised-tiger-global-private-investment-partners-xv--ec895b11">Private Investment Partners XV</a> were facing an 18% paper loss at the end of September — after the firm cut valuations on some of its portfolio companies.</p>
<p>Per that report, Tiger marked down AI-powered workflow company <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/superhuman/company_financials">Superhuman</a> by 45% and search engine platform <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/duck-duck-go">DuckDuckGo</a> by 72%.</p>
<p>It also marked down a couple of its NFT-related companies — <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bored-ape-yacht-club">Bored Ape Yacht Club</a> was down by 69% and NFT marketplace <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/opensea">OpenSea</a> by 94%.</p>
<p>WSJ previously reported Tiger <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tiger-global-writes-down-venture-funds-bets-by-33-in-2022-3f9f6ade">cut valuations</a> in its venture funds last year by about 33%, erasing $23 billion in value.</p>
<p>Earlier in the year, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/tiger-global-managements-12-7-billion-venture-fund-records-20-loss?utm_campaign=Automated+Fallback+R&amp;utm_content=89&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=cio&amp;utm_term=19&amp;rc=mswec4">The Information reported</a> several notable mark downs from the firm’s PIP fund, including its entire $38 million investment in the now bankrupt <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ftx-exchange">FTX</a> and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ftx-us">FTX.US</a>, as well as other crypto and Web3 investments such as <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/moonpay">MoonPay</a>, decentralized wireless network company <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/helium-systems-inc">Helium</a>, and a significant writedown on its largest holding, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bytedance">ByteDance</a>.</p>
<p>It seems clear some of those markdowns may have made even a tiger a little timid in this market.</p>

<title>Web3 Startup Wormhole Locks Up $225M At A $2.5B Valuation</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br><br>摘要：<br>这些信息是积极的。一家消息协议初创公司以25亿美元估值筹集了2.25亿美元的资金，成为今年Web3领域最大的融资。投资者包括亚马逊、谷歌和加密交易所币安。他们的股份将包括尚未公布的加密货币代币。Wormhole团队还宣布推出新公司Wormhole Labs，专注于跨链开发。此前，Jump Trading投资了约3.2亿美元进入该加密项目，但最近逐渐退出加密行业。今年Web3领域融资缓慢，全球Web3领域初创公司募集的资金不到65亿美元。 <div>
<p>Messaging protocol startup <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/wormhole-f145">Wormhole</a> raised $225 million at a $2.5 billion valuation — the biggest round this year in the Web3 space.</p>
<p>No investor led the round, which included the likes of <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/coinbase-ventures">Coinbase Ventures</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/jump-trading-llc">Jump Trading</a>, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/multicoin-capital">Multicoin Capital</a> and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/arrington-xrp-capital">Arrington XRP Capital</a>. Their stakes will consist of token warrants for a yet-to-be-unveiled cryptocurrency, <a href="https://fortune.com/crypto/2023/11/29/wormhole-raises-225-million-2-5-billion-valuation-jump-crypto-split/">per Fortune</a>.</p>
<p>The team behind Wormhole — whose platform allows developers to communicate across different blockchains — also announced the launch of <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/wormhole-labs/org_similarity_overview">Wormhole Labs</a>, an independent company that “specializes in building products, tools, and reference implementations” to help grow cross-chain development.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nearly three years ago, Wormhole was launched with the vision of a world resembling the one we see today,” said Saeed Badreg, co-founder and CEO of Wormhole Labs. “We reaffirmed our commitment to this vision by launching Wormhole Labs, dedicated to advancing the technology that makes efficient blockchain-to-blockchain communication possible.”</p>
<h2>A brief history</h2>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-17/jump-spins-off-wormhole-project-shrinking-its-crypto-business?sref=Dd2N48n2">Bloomberg reported</a> <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/jump-trading-llc">Jump Trading</a> was parting ways with Wormhole, which had been part of its digital-asset unit <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/jump-crypto">Jump Crypto</a>.</p>
<p>Jump Trading invested about $320 million into the crypto project almost two years ago following a massive hack, per the report, but has retrenched away from crypto more recently.</p>
<p>The round is exceedingly large when considering how slow funding has been this year in the Web3 sector. Many investors have backed away from the space as the venture market continues to slow and a series of scandals and regulations have affected the crypto industry.</p>
<p>Last year, nearly $26 billion was invested in VC-backed startups in the Web3 ecosystem. However, this year that number has dropped precipitously, as less than $6.5 billion have been raised globally by startups in the space, per Crunchbase <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/lists/funding-to-vc-backed-web-3-startups/c5214d15-3a9a-4a42-86eb-ecdf37ecaa85/funding_rounds">data</a>.</p>

<title>Many Crypto-Corns Navigate Trying Times After FTX Fall</title>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<div> <br><br>摘要：<br>这些信息是消极的。加密货币领域的初创公司在最近面临诸多困难，包括OpenSea估值下调90%，以及许多其他加密货币独角兽公司的估值下调。例如，Figure的估值下调了70%，Bitpanda裁员约三分之一，Yuga Labs也经历了变故。这些事件表明投资者对加密货币领域采取了更加谨慎的态度，导致新的独角兽公司的出现速度显著降低。 <div>
<p>It has been a tough go as of late for startups in the crypto space.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/fintech-ecommerce/sbf-ftx-trial-crypto-vc-investment/">Everyone knows funding has plummeted in the sector</a>, and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/sam-bankman-fried">Sam Bankman-Fried</a>’s recent conviction brought <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ftx-exchange">FTX</a>’s troubles back to the forefront.</p>
<p>Then, just this week, <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/coatue-cuts-value-of-opensea-stake-by-90-as-funds-returns-sag?offer=rtsu-engagement-sept-23&amp;utm_campaign=RTSU+-+Coatue+Opense&amp;utm_content=2147&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=cio&amp;utm_term=1567&amp;rc=mswec4">it was reported</a> <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/coatue">Coatue</a> has marked down its stake in <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/opensea">OpenSea</a> by 90%, now valuing it at about $1.4 billion. That is a significant drop considering in January 2022, the NFT marketplace raised a $300 million Series C co-led by Coatue and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/paradigm-b23a">Paradigm</a> at a $13 billion valuation.</p>
<p>However, OpenSea is not alone in being a once high-flying crypto unicorn — or crypto-corn — that seems to have suffered during the recent FTX backlash and <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/global-venture-funding-instacart-klaviyo-q3-2023/">general market downturn for VC-backed startups.</a></p>
<p>More than 90 crypto and blockchain startups have been minted as unicorns in recent years, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/lists/crypto-and-blockchain-unicorns/e7d7a43c-045d-4e72-837c-5ab1f6330eef/organization.companies">per Crunchbase data</a>. While they raised money at $1 billion-plus valuations, many of those valuations have likely changed as both the venture and crypto worlds are quite different from even just 12 months ago.</p>
<p>While many companies do not announce valuation cuts or down rounds, in recent months many startups seem to have watched investors slice their valuations since those big-money funding rounds, gone through significant layoffs, or faced other internal strife.</p>
<h2>Crypto-corn downs</h2>
<p>Let’s take a look at some startups whose unicorn horns may be a bit shorter.</p>
<ul>
<li>In May 2021, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/figure-66e9">Figure</a>, which offers financial services using blockchain technology, raised $200 million co-led by <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/10t-holdings">10T Holdings</a> and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/morgan-creek-digital">Morgan Creek Digital</a> at a $3.2 billion valuation. In February, it was <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-06/ex-sofi-ceo-s-blockchain-startup-figure-slashed-funding-goals-in-hard-market?leadSource=uverify%20wall&amp;sref=Dd2N48n2">reported</a> Figure was searching for investors to participate in a $100 million round and was also seeking to spin off some product lines. The company also had previously scrapped a plan to go public through a SPAC.</li>
<li>In August 2021, crypto infrastructure startup <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/blockstream">Blockstream</a> raised $210 million at a $3.2 billion valuation. However, last December <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bloomberg">Bloomberg</a> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-12-06/crypto-firm-blockstream-seeks-fresh-funding-at-a-lower-valuation-in-tight-market?leadSource=uverify%20wall&amp;sref=Dd2N48n2">reported</a> the company was seeking to raise money at a valuation of less than $1 billion — a 70% drop. In January, the company raised $125 million in convertible notes and secured financing.</li>
<li>In November 2021, crypto payments startup <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/moonpay">MoonPay</a> raised a $555 million Series A led by <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/tiger-global">Tiger Global Management</a> and Coatue that valued the company at $3.4 billion. It was later <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/moonpay-ceo-other-executives-cashed-out-before-crypto-business-dropped?rc=mswec4">reported</a> several executives cashed out during that round — accounting for $150 million of that $555 million — which was just before crypto started its descent. By the end of last year, Tiger lowered its valuation of the company to $2.8 billion.</li>
<li>In December 2021, bitcoin trading and banking firm <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nydig">NYDIG</a> raised $1 billion at a valuation of more than $7 billion led by <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/westcap-sf">WestCap</a>. Less than a year later — in September 2022 — the company laid off about a third of its workforce — 110 people, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/crypto-broker-nydig-lays-off-one-third-of-staff-in-effort-to-narrow-focus-11665707545">per a story in The Wall Street Journal</a>.</li>
<li>In March 2022, crypto exchange <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/blockchain-info">Blockchain.com</a> raised a Series D — no amount was disclosed — led by <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/lightspeed-venture-partners">Lightspeed Venture Partners</a> at a $14 billion valuation. Late last year <a href="https://blockworks.co/news/blockchain-com-eyes-funding-at-70-lower-valuation-report">reports</a> surfaced that the company was looking to raise money at a valuation as low as $3 billion after being exposed to crypto hedge fund <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/three-arrows-capital">Three Arrows Capital</a>, which collapsed into bankruptcy. It also was <a href="https://decrypt.co/121627/blockchain-com-shopping-assets-to-fill-270m-hole-from-three-arrows-capital-sources">reported</a> earlier this year the company was selling off assets.</li>
<li>In April 2022, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/binance-us">Binance.US</a> — the American franchise of Malta-based <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/binance">Binance</a> — raised more than $200 million in a seed round at a pre-money valuation of $4.5 billion. However, both Binance and Binance.US have come under intense scrutiny from U.S. regulators. In June, the <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/securities-and-exchange-commission">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> filed 13 charges against crypto exchange Binance, its co-founder <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/person/changpeng-zhao">Changpeng Zhao</a>, and other entities related to the exchange. That same month, Binance.US stopped dollar deposits after the SEC asked a court to freeze its assets and just last month halted withdrawal of dollars by its clients from the platform.</li>
<li>In May 2022,  crypto asset manager <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/babel-finance">Babel Finance</a> raised an $80 million Series B at a $1.9 billion valuation co-led by <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/10t-holdings">10T Holdings</a> and <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/jeneration-capital">Jeneration Capital</a>. However, a month later, Babel <a href="https://babel.finance/article-views.html?id=50">froze withdrawals and redemptions</a> as the market declined. The company <a href="https://babel.finance/article-views.html?id=57">filed</a> for moratorium protection in Singapore to allow for restructuring efforts and it has a meeting next month with creditors.</li>
<li>In September 2022, digital collectables maker <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/dapper-labs">Dapper Labs</a> raised a $250 million round led by Coatue that reportedly valued the company at $7.6 billion. The company has since gone through <a href="https://decrypt.co/148412/nba-top-shot-developer-dapper-labs-announces-more-layoffs">three rounds of layoffs</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What it means</h2>
<p>Of course, by the time some of these crypto-corns raise their next rounds, their valuations could be even higher than they were in the previous rounds in 2021-22. It is also important to note it is not just unicorns in the crypto space that are having a hard time (see <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/convoy-3">Convoy</a>). Smaller companies in the space are also undoubtedly facing valuation cuts or other issues.</p>
<p>However, the onslaught of valuation cuts, layoffs and liquidity crunches at some of the highest-flying <a href="https://pinbig.com/jupiter-coin-a-whirlwind-journey/">crypto startups</a> in the last year-plus is concerning and makes it clear why VCs have cut back on investment in the space even more than in other sectors — and why the minting of new unicorns has slowed significantly.</p>
<p>That is not to say new crypto-corns are not being created. In July, blockchain transaction software developer <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/flashbots">Flashbots</a> raised a $60 million Series B from <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/paradigm-b23a">Paradigm</a> at a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-25/ethereum-software-infrastructure-provider-flashbots-raises-60-million?sref=Dd2N48n2">reported</a> value of at least $1 billion. The following month, crypto custody firm Palo Alto, California-based <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/bitgo">BitGo</a> raised a <a href="https://news.crunchbase.com/fintech-ecommerce/crypto-wallet-startup-bitgo-unicorn/">$100 million Series C</a> at a $1.75 billion valuation.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, investors seem wary and are taking a more conservative approach to the space — something that seems two to three years too late.</p>
